       <span id="vs28">or his sin that he has committed has been made known to him, then he must bring as his offering a female kid of the goats, a sound one, for his sin that he has committed.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And he must lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the same place as the burnt offering.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>

       <span id="vs3">or he does find something lost and is actually deceptive about it and does swear falsely over any of all the things that the man might do to sin by them;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">then it must occur that in case he sins and indeed becomes guilty, he must return the robbed thing which he has robbed or the extorted thing which he has taken by fraud or the thing in his charge which was put in his charge or the thing lost that he has found,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">or anything at all over which he might swear falsely, and he must make compensation for it in its full amount, and he will add to it a fifth of it. To the one whose it is he will give it on the day his guilt is proved.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And as his guilt offering he will bring to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value, for a guilt offering, to the priest.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the priest must make an atonement for him before Jehovah, and so it must be forgiven him regarding any of all the things that he might do resulting in guiltiness by it.”</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering will be on the hearth upon the altar all night long until the morning, and the fire of the altar will be kindled in it.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the priest must clothe himself with his official dress of linen, and he will put the linen drawers on over his flesh. Then he must lift up the fatty ashes of the burnt offering that the fire regularly consumes upon the altar, and he must place them beside the altar.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he must strip off his garments and put on other garments, and he must take the fatty ashes out to a clean place outside the camp.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the fire on the altar will be kept burning on it. It must not go out.

       <span id="vs13">Fire will be kept constantly burning on the altar. It must not go out.</span>

       <span id="vs17">It should not be baked with anything leavened. I have given it as their share out of my offerings made by fire. It is something most holy, like the sin offering and like the guilt offering.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Every male among the sons of Aaron will eat it. It is an allowance to time indefinite throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. Everything that may touch them will become holy.’”</span>

       <span id="vs21">It will be made with oil upon a griddle. You will bring it well mixed. You will present the pastries of the grain offering in pieces as a restful odor to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the priest, the one anointed in place of him from among his sons, will make it. It is a regulation to time indefinite: As a whole offering it will be made to smoke to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And every grain offering of a priest should prove to be a whole offering. It must not be eaten.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is regularly slaughtered the sin offering will be slaughtered before Jehovah. It is a most holy thing.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">The priest who offers it for sin will eat it. In a holy place it will be eaten in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.</span>

       <span id="vs27">“‘Everything that may touch its flesh will become holy, and when anyone spatters some of its blood upon the garment, you will wash what he spatters blood upon in a holy place.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the earthenware vessel in which it may be boiled is to be shattered. But if it was boiled in a copper vessel, then it must be scoured and rinsed with water.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“‘Every male among the priests will eat it. It is something most holy.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">However, no sin offering of which some of the blood will be brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place must be eaten. It is to be burned with fire.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unfermented cakes,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and make all the assembly congregate at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him, and the assembly congregated at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Moses now said to the assembly: “This is the thing that Jehovah has given command to do.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and washed them with water.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">After that he put the robe upon him and girded him with the sash and clothed him with the sleeveless coat and put the eph&acute;od upon him and girded him with the girdle of the eph&acute;od and bound it closely to him with it.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Next he placed the breastpiece upon him and put in the breastpiece the U&acute;rim and the Thum&acute;mim.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then he placed the turban upon his head and placed upon the turban at the forefront of it the shining plate of gold, the holy sign of dedication, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Moses now took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and sanctified them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">After that he spattered some of it seven times upon the altar and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand so as to sanctify them.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Finally he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him so as to sanctify him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Moses then brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them with robes and girded them with sashes and wrapped the headgear upon them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then he led up the bull of the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of the sin offering.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Moses proceeded to slaughter it and take the blood and put it with his finger upon the horns of the altar round about and purify the altar from sin, but the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar, that he might sanctify it to make atonement upon it.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">After that he took all the fat that was upon the intestines, and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and Moses made them smoke upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he had the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He now brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons then laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">After that Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood round about upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he cut up the ram into its pieces, and Moses proceeded to make the head and the pieces and the suet smoke.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the intestines and the shanks he washed with water, and Moses then made the entire ram smoke upon the altar. It was a burnt offering for a restful odor. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then he brought the second ram, the ram of the installation, near, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the ram’s head.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">After that Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it upon the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the big toe of his right foot.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Next Moses brought Aaron’s sons near and put some of the blood upon the lobe of their right ear and upon the thumb of their right hand and upon the big toe of their right foot; but Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood round about upon the altar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was upon the intestines, and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right leg.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And out of the basket of unfermented cakes that was before Jehovah he took one unfermented ring-shaped cake and one ring-shaped cake of oiled bread and one wafer. He then placed them upon the fatty pieces and the right leg.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">After that he put all of them upon the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Moses took them off their palms and made them smoke upon the altar on top of the burnt offering. They were an installation sacrifice for a restful odor. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And Moses proceeded to take the breast and to wave it to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah. From the installation ram it became the portion for Moses, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">After that Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was upon the altar and spattered it upon Aaron and his garments and upon his sons and the garments of his sons with him. Thus he sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and the garments of his sons with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there is where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat it and the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was given the command, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And what is left over of the flesh and the bread <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will burn with fire.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day of fulfilling the days of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> installation, because it will take seven days to fill <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand with power.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Just as it has been done this day, Jehovah has commanded to be done so as to make atonement for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep the obligatory watch of Jehovah, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not die; for so I have been commanded.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And Aaron and his sons proceeded to do all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the older men of Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he said to Aaron: “Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But to the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and a grain offering moistened with oil, because today is when Jehovah will certainly appear to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting. Then the whole assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Moses went on to say: “This is the thing that Jehovah has commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should do, that the glory of Jehovah may appear to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Moses said to Aaron: “Go near to the altar and render up your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement in your own behalf and in behalf of your house; and render up the offering of the people and make atonement in their behalf, just as Jehovah has commanded.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Aaron immediately went near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering that was for him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And he made the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering smoke upon the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he burned the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then he slaughtered the burnt offering and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it round about upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And they handed him the burnt offering in its pieces and the head, and he proceeded to make them smoke upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Further, he washed the intestines and the shanks and made them smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">He now went presenting the offering of the people and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and made an offering for sin with it as with the first.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then he presented the burnt offering and handled it according to the regular procedure.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">He next presented the grain offering and filled his hand with some of it and made it smoke upon the altar, apart from the burnt offering of the morning.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">After that he slaughtered the bull and the ram of the communion sacrifice that was for the people. Then Aaron’s sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it round about upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As for the fatty pieces of the bull and the fat tail of the ram and the fat covering and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">they now placed the fatty pieces upon the breasts, after which he made the fatty pieces smoke upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But the breasts and the right leg Aaron waved to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from rendering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Finally Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs23-2">Then Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the people,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and fire came out from before Jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar. When all the people got to see it, they broke out into shouting and went falling upon their faces.</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Subsequently Moses said to Aaron and to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar and Ith&acute;a&middot;mar his [other] sons: “Do not let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads go ungroomed, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not tear <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> garments, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not die and that he may not become indignant against all the assembly; but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers of the whole house of Israel will do the weeping over the burning, which Jehovah has made burn.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And from the entrance of the tent of meeting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not go out for fear <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may die, because Jehovah’s anointing oil is upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.” So they did according to Moses’ word.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Aaron, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Do not drink wine or intoxicating liquor, you and your sons with you, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come into the tent of meeting, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not die. It is a statute to time indefinite for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">both in order to make a distinction between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and in order to teach the sons of Israel all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them by means of Moses.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar and Ith&acute;a&middot;mar, his sons that were left: “Take the grain offering that was left over from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire and eat it unfermented near the altar, because it is something most holy.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must eat it in a holy place, because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire; for so I have been commanded.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because they have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">They will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings made by fire, of the fatty pieces, in order to wave the wave offering to and fro before Jehovah; and it must serve as an allowance to time indefinite for you and your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Moses searched thoroughly for the goat of the sin offering, and, look! it had been burned up. So he grew indignant at El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar and Ith&acute;a&middot;mar, Aaron’s sons that were left, saying:</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Why did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not eat the sin offering in the place that is holy, since it is something most holy and he has given it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may answer for the error of the assembly so as to make atonement for them before Jehovah?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Look! Its blood has not been brought into the holy place within. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> should have eaten it without fail in the holy place, just as I had been commanded.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">At this Aaron spoke to Moses: “Look! Today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, while such things as these began to befall me; and had I eaten the sin offering today, would it prove satisfactory in Jehovah’s eyes?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">When Moses got to hear that, then it proved satisfactory in his eyes.</span>

       <span id="vs8">But if she cannot afford enough for a sheep, she must then take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest must make atonement for her, and she must be clean.’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“In case a man develops in the skin of his flesh an eruption or a scab or a blotch and it does develop in the skin of his flesh into the plague of leprosy, he must then be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the priest must look at the plague in the skin of the flesh. When the hair in the plague has turned white and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy. And the priest must look at it, and he must declare him unclean.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But if the blotch is white in the skin of his flesh and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and its hair has not turned white, the priest must then quarantine the plague seven days.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the priest must look at him on the seventh day, and if in the way it looks the plague has stopped, the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest must also quarantine him another seven days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“And the priest must look at him on the seventh day the second time, and if the plague has grown dull and the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest must also pronounce him clean. It was a scab. And he must wash his garments and be clean.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But if the scab has unquestionably spread in the skin after his appearing before the priest for the establishment of his purification, he must then appear the second time before the priest,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and the priest must take a look; and if the scab has spread in the skin, the priest must then declare him unclean. It is leprosy.</span>

       <span id="vs10">And the priest must take a look; and if there is a white eruption in the skin and it has turned the hair white and the raw of the living flesh is in the eruption,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">it is chronic leprosy in the skin of his flesh; and the priest must declare him unclean. He should not quarantine him, for he is unclean.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now if the leprosy unquestionably breaks out in the skin, and the leprosy does cover all the skin of the one with the plague from his head to his feet to the full sight of the priest’s eyes;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and the priest has looked and there the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he must then pronounce the plague clean. All of it has turned white. He is clean.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But on the day the living flesh appears in it, he will be unclean.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs19">and in the place of the boil a white eruption has developed or a reddish-white blotch, he must then show himself to the priest.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the priest must look, and if its appearance is lower than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest must then declare him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. It has broken out in the boil.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But if the priest looks at it, and, there now, there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and it is dull, the priest must then quarantine him seven days.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>

       <span id="vs25">the priest must then look at it; and if the hair has been changed white in the blotch and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken out in the scar, and the priest must declare him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But if the priest looks at it, and, there now, there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not lower than the skin and it is dull, the priest must then quarantine him seven days.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the priest must look at him on the seventh day. If it unmistakably spreads in the skin, the priest must then declare him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But if the blotch stands in its place, it has not spread in the skin and it is dull, it is an eruption of the scar; and the priest must pronounce him clean, because it is an inflammation of the scar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“As for a man or a woman, in case a plague develops in such one on the head or on the chin,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">the priest must then see the plague; and if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and the hair is yellow and scarce in it, the priest must then declare such one unclean. It is an abnormal falling off of hair. It is leprosy of the head or of the chin.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But in case the priest sees the plague of abnormal falling off of hair, and, look! its appearance is not deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest must then quarantine the plague of abnormal falling off of hair seven days.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the priest must look at the plague on the seventh day; and if the abnormal falling off of hair has not spread, and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the abnormal falling off of hair is not deeper than the skin,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">he must then have himself shaved, but he will not have the abnormal falling off of hair shaved; and the priest must quarantine the abnormal falling off of hair seven days again.</span>

       <span id="vs36">the priest must then see him; and if the abnormal falling off of hair has spread in the skin, the priest need not make examination for yellow hair; he is unclean.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But if in its look the abnormal falling off of hair has stood and black hair has grown in it, the abnormal falling off of hair has been healed. He is clean, and the priest must pronounce him clean.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“As for a man or a woman, in case blotches develop in the skin of their flesh, white blotches,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">the priest must then take a look; and if the blotches in the skin of their flesh are dull white, it is a harmless eruption. It has broken out in the skin. He is clean.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“As for a man, in case his head grows bald, it is baldness. He is clean.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And if his head grows bald up in front, it is forehead baldness. He is clean.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">But in case a reddish-white plague develops in the baldness of the crown or of the forehead, it is leprosy breaking out in the baldness of his crown or of his forehead.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And the priest must look at him; and if there is an eruption of the reddish-white plague in the baldness of his crown or of his forehead like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">he is a leper. He is unclean. Unclean is what the priest should declare him. His plague is on his head.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">As for the leprous one in whom the plague is, his garments should be torn, and his head should become ungroomed, and he should cover over the mustache and call out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">All the days that the plague is in him he will be unclean. He is unclean. He should dwell isolated. Outside the camp is his dwelling place.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">“As for a garment, in case the plague of leprosy develops in it, whether in a woolen garment or in a linen garment,</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">or in the warp or in the woof of the linen and of the wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">and the yellowish-green or reddish plague does develop in the garment or in the skin or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is the plague of leprosy, and it must be shown to the priest.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">And the priest must see the plague, and he must quarantine the plague seven days.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">When he has seen the plague on the seventh day, that the plague has spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in the skin for any use for which the skin may be made, the plague is malignant leprosy. It is unclean.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And he must burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen, or any article of skin in which the plague may develop, because it is malignant leprosy. It should be burned in the fire.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">“But if the priest takes a look, and, there now, the plague has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin,</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">the priest must also command that they should wash that in which the plague is, and he must quarantine it a second seven days.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">And the priest must look at the plague after it has been washed out, and if the plague has not changed its look and yet the plague has not spread, it is unclean. You should burn it in the fire. It is a low spot in a threadbare patch on either its underside or its outside.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">“But if the priest has taken a look, and, there now, the plague is dull after it has been washed out, he must then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">However, if it still appears in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is breaking out. You should burn in the fire whatever it is in which the plague is.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">As for the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you may wash, when the plague has disappeared from them, it must then be washed a second time; and it must be clean.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">“This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, in order to pronounce it clean or to declare it unclean.”</span>

       <span id="vs3">Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the tent of meeting Aaron should set it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah constantly. It is a statute to time indefinite during <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs7">And you must put pure frankincense upon each layer set, and it must serve as the bread for a remembrancer, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">On one sabbath day after another he should set it in order before Jehovah constantly. It is a covenant to time indefinite with the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs10">Now a son of an Israelite woman, who, however, was the son of an Egyptian man, went out into the midst of the sons of Israel, and the son of the Israelitess and an Israelite man began to struggle with each other in the camp.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the son of the Israelite woman began to abuse the Name and to call down evil upon it. So they brought him to Moses.

       <span id="vs15">And you should speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘In case any man calls down evil upon his God, he must then answer for his sin.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So the abuser of Jehovah’s name should be put to death without fail. The entire assembly should without fail pelt him with stones. The alien resident the same as the native should be put to death for his abusing the Name.</span>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“‘And in case a man strikes any soul of mankind fatally, he should be put to death without fail.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the fatal striker of the soul of a domestic animal should make compensation for it, soul for soul.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And in case a man should cause a defect in his associate, then just as he has done, so it should be done to him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; the same sort of defect he may cause in the man, that is what should be caused in him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the fatal striker of a beast should make compensation for it, but the fatal striker of a man should be put to death.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘In case a man makes a special vow offering of souls to Jehovah according to the estimated value,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and the estimated value has to be of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, the estimated value must then become fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But if it is a female, the estimated value must then become thirty shekels.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And if the age is from five years old up to twenty years old, the estimated value of the male must then become twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And if the age is from a month old up to five years old, the estimated value of the male must then become five shekels of silver and for the female the estimated value must be three shekels of silver.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘Now if the age is from sixty years old upward, if it is a male, the estimated value must then become fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But if he has become too poor for the estimated value, he must then stand the person before the priest, and the priest must put a valuation upon him. According to what the vower can afford, the priest will put a valuation upon him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“‘And if it is a beast such as one presents in offering to Jehovah, everything of what he may give to Jehovah will become something holy.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">He may not replace it, and he may not exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good. But if he should exchange it at all with beast for beast, it itself must then become and what is exchanged for it should become something holy.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And if it is any unclean beast such as one may not present in offering to Jehovah, he must then stand the beast before the priest.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the priest must put a valuation upon it whether it is good or bad. According to the value estimated by the priest, so it should become.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But if he wants to buy it back at all, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the estimated value.</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘Now in case a man should sanctify his house as something holy to Jehovah, the priest must then make a valuation of it whether it is good or bad. According to what valuation the priest makes of it, so much it should cost.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But if the sanctifier wants to buy his house back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it; and it must become his.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“‘And if it is some of the field of his possession that a man would sanctify to Jehovah, the value must then be estimated in proportion to its seed: if a ho&acute;mer of barley seed, then at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If he should sanctify his field from the year of Jubilee on, it should cost according to the estimated value.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And if it is after the Jubilee that he sanctifies his field, the priest must then calculate for him the price in proportion to the years that are left over until the next year of Jubilee, and a deduction should be made from the estimated value.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But if the sanctifier of it would at all buy the field back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it must stand fast as his.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now if he should not buy the field back but if the field is sold to another man, it may not be bought back again.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the field when it goes out in the Jubilee must become something holy to Jehovah, as a field that is devoted. The possession of it will become the priest’s.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“‘And if he sanctifies to Jehovah a field purchased by him that is no part of the field of his possession,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">the priest must then calculate for him the amount of the valuation up till the year of Jubilee, and he must give the estimated value on that day. It is something holy to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In the year of Jubilee the field will return to the one from whom he bought it, to the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“‘Now every value should be estimated in the shekel of the holy place. The shekel should amount to twenty ge&acute;rahs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“‘Only the firstborn among beasts, which is born as the firstborn for Jehovah, no man should sanctify it. Whether bull or sheep, it belongs to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And if it is among the unclean beasts and he must redeem it according to the estimated value, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it should not be bought back, it must then be sold according to the estimated value.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“‘Only no sort of devoted thing that a man might devote to Jehovah for destruction out of all that is his, whether from mankind or beasts or from the field of his possession, may be sold, and no sort of devoted thing may be bought back. It is something most holy to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">No devoted person who might be devoted to destruction from among mankind may be redeemed. He should be put to death without fail.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“‘And every tenth part of the land, out of the seed of the land and the fruit of the tree, belongs to Jehovah. It is something holy to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And if a man wants to buy any of his tenth part back at all, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">As for every tenth part of the herd and flock, everything that passes under the crook, the tenth head should become something holy to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">He should not examine whether it is good or bad, neither should he exchange it. But if he would exchange it at all, it itself must then become and what is exchanged for it should become something holy. It may not be bought back.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">These are the commandments that Jehovah gave Moses as commands to the sons of Israel in Mount Si&acute;nai.</span>
