<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now it came about in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth [day] of the month, while I was in the midst of the exiled people by the river Che&acute;bar, that the heavens were opened and I began to see visions of God.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">On the fifth [day] of the month, that is, [in] the fifth year of the exile of King Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;chin,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">the word of Jehovah occurred specifically to Ezekiel the son of Bu&acute;zi the priest in the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans by the river Che&acute;bar, and upon him in that place the hand of Jehovah came to be.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I began to see, and, look! there was a tempestuous wind coming from the north, a great cloud mass and quivering fire, and it had a brightness all around, and out of the midst of it there was something like the look of electrum, out of the midst of the fire.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And out of the midst of it there was the likeness of four living creatures, and this was how they looked: they had the likeness of earthling man.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And [each] one had four faces, and [each] one of them four wings.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf; and they were gleaming as with the glow of burnished copper.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And there were the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides, and the four of them had their faces and their wings.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Their wings were joining one to the other. They would not turn when they went; they would go each one straight forward.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And as for the likeness of their faces, the four of them had a man’s face with a lion’s face to the right, and the four of them had a bull’s face on the left; the four of them also had an eagle’s face.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">That is the way their faces were. And their wings were spreading out upward. Each one had two joining to each other, and two were covering their bodies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And they would go each one straight forward. To wherever the spirit would incline to go, they would go. They would not turn as they went.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire. Something like the appearance of torches was moving back and forth between the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire there was lightning going forth.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And on the part of the living creatures there was a going forth and a returning as with the appearance of the lightning.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As I kept seeing the living creatures, why, look! there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, by the four faces of each.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">As for the appearance of the wheels and their structure, it was like the glow of chrys&acute;o&middot;lite; and the four of them had one likeness. And their appearance and their structure were just as when a wheel proved to be in the midst of a wheel.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When they went they would go on their four respective sides. They would not turn another way when they went.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And as for their rims, they had such height that they caused fearfulness; and their rims were full of eyes all around the four of them.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels would go beside them, and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would be lifted up.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Wherever the spirit inclined to go, they would go, the spirit [inclining] to go there; and the wheels themselves would be lifted up close alongside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When they went, these would go; and when they stood still, these would stand still; and when they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would be lifted up close alongside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse like the sparkle of awesome ice, stretched out over their heads up above.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And under the expanse their wings were straight, one to the other. Each one had two wings covering on this side and each one had two covering on that side their bodies.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And I got to hear the sound of their wings, a sound like that of vast waters, like the sound of the Almighty One, when they went, the sound of a tumult, like the sound of an encampment. When they stood still, they would let their wings down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And there came to be a voice above the expanse that was over their head. (When they stood still, they would let their wings down.)</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And above the expanse that was over their head there was something in appearance like sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. And upon the likeness of the throne there was a likeness of someone in appearance like an earthling man upon it, up above.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And I got to see something like the glow of electrum, like the appearance of fire all around inside thereof, from the appearance of his hips and upward; and from the appearance of his hips and downward I saw something like the appearance of fire, and he had a brightness all around.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">There was something like the appearance of the bow that occurs in a cloud mass on the day of a pouring rain. That is how the appearance was of the brightness round about. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. When I got to see [it], then I fell upon my face, and I began to hear the voice of one speaking.</span>

       <span id="vs15">So I entered in among the exiled people at Tel-a&acute;bib, who were dwelling by the river Che&acute;bar, and I began to dwell where they were dwelling; and I kept dwelling there for seven days, stunned in the midst of them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it came about at the end of seven days that the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to me, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Son of man, a watchman is what I have made you to the house of Israel, and you must hear from my mouth speech and you must warn them from me.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">When I say to someone wicked, ‘You will positively die,’ and you do not actually warn him and speak in order to warn the wicked one from his wicked way to preserve him alive, he being wicked, in his error he will die, but his blood I shall ask back from your own hand.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But as for you, in case you have warned someone wicked and he does not actually turn back from his wickedness and from his wicked way, he himself for his error will die; but as for you, you will have delivered your own soul.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And when someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and actually does injustice and I must put a stumbling block before him, he himself will die because you did not warn him. For his sin he will die, and his righteous acts that he did will not be remembered, but his blood I shall ask back from your own hand.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And as for you, in case you have warned someone righteous that the righteous one should not sin, and he himself does not actually sin, he will without fail keep on living because he had been warned, and you yourself will have delivered your own soul.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the hand of Jehovah came to be upon me there and he proceeded to say to me: “Get up, go forth to the valley plain, and there I shall speak with you.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So I got up and went forth to the valley plain, and, look! the glory of Jehovah was standing there, like the glory that I had seen by the river Che&acute;bar, and I went falling upon my face.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet, and he began to speak with me and say to me:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs24-2">“Come, be shut up inside your house.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And you, O son of man, look! they will certainly put cords upon you and bind you with them so that you cannot go forth into the midst of them.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And your very tongue I will make stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will certainly become mute, and you will not become to them a man administering reproof, because they are a rebellious house.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And when I speak with you I shall open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said.’ Let the one hearing hear, and let the one refraining refrain, because they are a rebellious house.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], on the fifth day of the month, that I was sitting in my house and the older men of Judah were sitting before me, when the hand of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And I began to see, and, look! a likeness similar to the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his hips even downward there was fire, and from his hips even upward there was something like the appearance of a shining, like the glow of electrum.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then he thrust out the representation of a hand and took me by a tuft of hair of my head, and a spirit carried me between the earth and the heavens and brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the entrance of the inner gate that is facing northward, where the dwelling place is of the symbol of jealousy that is inciting to jealousy.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And, look! the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I had seen in the valley plain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he proceeded to say to me: “Son of man, please, raise your eyes in the direction of the north.” So I raised my eyes in the direction of the north, and, look! to the north of the gate of the altar there was this symbol of jealousy in the entranceway.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he went on to say to me: “Son of man, are you seeing what great detestable things they are doing, the things that the house of Israel are doing here [for me] to become far off from my sanctuary? And yet you will see again great detestable things.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Accordingly he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and I began to see, and, look! a certain hole in the wall.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He now said to me: “Son of man, bore, please, through the wall.” And I gradually bored through the wall, and, look! there was a certain entrance.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he further said to me: “Go in and see the bad detestable things that they are doing here.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So I went in and began to see, and, look! there was every representation of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the dungy idols of the house of Israel, the carving being upon the wall all round about.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And seventy men of the elderly ones of the house of Israel, with Ja&middot;az&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Sha&acute;phan standing in among them, were standing before them, each one with his censer in his hand, and the perfume of the cloud of the incense was ascending.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he proceeded to say to me: “Have you seen, O son of man, what the elderly ones of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms of his showpiece? For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’”</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, look! there were six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces to the north, each one with his weapon for smashing in his hand; and there was one man in among them clothed with linen, with a secretary’s inkhorn at his hips, and they proceeded to come in and stand beside the copper altar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And as regards the glory of the God of Israel, it was taken up from over the cherubs over which it happened to be to the threshold of the house, and he began calling out to the man that was clothed with the linen, at whose hips there was the secretary’s inkhorn.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jehovah went on to say to him: “Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and you must put a mark on the foreheads of the men that are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the midst of it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And to these [others] he said in my ears: “Pass through the city after him and strike. Let not your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Old man, young man and virgin and little child and women <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should kill off—to a ruination.

       <span id="vs7">And he said further to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain ones. Go forth!” And they went forth and struck in the city.</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about that, while they were striking and I was left remaining, I proceeded to fall upon my face and cry out and say: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So he said to me: “The error of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is filled with bloodshed and the city is full of crookedness; for they have said, ‘Jehovah has left the land, and Jehovah is not seeing.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs1">And I continued to see, and, look! upon the expanse that was over the head of the cherubs there was something like sapphire stone, like the appearance of the likeness of a throne, appearing above them.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to say to the man clothed with the linen, even to say: “Enter in between the wheelwork, in under the cherubs, and fill the hollows of both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs and toss [them] over the city.” So he entered in before my eyes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs6">And it came about, when he commanded the man clothed with the linen, saying: “Take fire from between the wheelwork, from between the cherubs,” that he proceeded to enter and stand beside the wheel.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then the cherub thrust his hand out from between the cherubs to the fire that was between the cherubs and carried and put [it] into the hollows of the hands of the one clothed with the linen, who now took [it] and went out.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

       <span id="vs11">When they would go, to their four sides they would go. They would not change direction when they went, because the place to which the head would face, after it they would go. They would not change direction when they went.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And all their flesh and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around. The four of them had their wheels.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs16">and when the cherubs went, the wheels would go alongside them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not change direction, even they themselves, from alongside them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, they would rise with them, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</span>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the glory of Jehovah proceeded to go forth from over the threshold of the house and to stand still over the cherubs.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs5">Then the spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he went on to say to me: “Say, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> people said the right thing, O house of Israel; and as regards the things that come up in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> spirit, I myself have known it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have caused <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> slain ones in this city to be many, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have filled her streets with the slain [ones].”’”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘As regards <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> slain ones whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have put in the midst of her, they are the flesh, and she is the widemouthed cooking pot; and there will be a bringing forth of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves out of the midst of her.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘A sword <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have feared, and a sword I shall bring upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">‘And I shall certainly bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forth out of the midst of her and give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into the hand of strangers and execute upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> acts of judgment.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">By the sword <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will fall. On the border of Israel I shall judge <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to know that I am Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">She herself will not prove to be for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a widemouthed cooking pot, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will not prove to be flesh in the midst of her. On the border of Israel I shall judge <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to know that I am Jehovah, because in my regulations <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not walk and my judgments <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not do, but according to the judgments of the nations that are round about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have done.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it came about that as soon as I prophesied Pel&middot;a&middot;ti&acute;ah the son of Be&middot;nai&acute;ah himself died, and I proceeded to fall upon my face and cry with a loud voice and say: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Is it an extermination that you are executing with the remaining ones of Israel?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Son of man, as regards your brothers, your brothers, the men concerned with your right to repurchase, and all the house of Israel, all of it, are the ones to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Get far away from Jehovah. To us it belongs; the land has been given [us] as a thing to possess’;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">therefore say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Although I have put them far away among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the lands, yet I shall become to them a sanctuary for a little while among the lands to which they have come.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “I will also collect <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the peoples and gather <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the lands among which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been scattered, and I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the soil of Israel.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And they will certainly come there and remove all its disgusting things and all its detestable things out of it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I shall put inside them; and I shall certainly remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">in order that they may walk in my own statutes and keep my own judicial decisions and actually carry them out; and they may really become my people and I myself may become their God.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“‘“But as for those whose heart is walking in their disgusting things and their detestable things, upon their head I shall certainly bring their own way,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the cherubs now lifted up their wings, and the wheels were close by them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them, from above.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the glory of Jehovah went ascending from over the midst of the city and began to stand over the mountain that is to the east of the city.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And a spirit itself lifted me up and finally brought me to Chal&middot;de&acute;a to the exiled people, in the vision by the spirit of God; and the vision that I had seen went ascending from upon me.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And I began to speak to the exiled people all the things of Jehovah that he had caused me to see.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Son of man, in the midst of a rebellious house is where you are dwelling, that have eyes to see but they actually do not see, that have ears to hear but they actually do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">As for you, O son of man, make up for yourself luggage for exile and go into exile in the daytime before their eyes, and you must go into exile from your place to another place before their eyes. Perhaps they will see, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you must bring out your luggage like luggage for exile in the daytime before their eyes, and you yourself will go out in the evening before their eyes like those being brought forth for exile.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Before their eyes, bore your way through the wall, and you must do the bringing out through it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Before their eyes you will do the carrying on the shoulder itself. During the darkness you will do the bringing out. You will cover your very face that you may not see the earth, because a portent is what I have made you to the house of Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I proceeded to do just the way that I had been commanded. My luggage I brought out, just like luggage for exile, in the daytime; and in the evening I bored my way through the wall by hand. During the darkness I did the bringing out. On my shoulder I did the carrying, before their eyes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me in the morning, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Son of man, did not those of the house of Israel, the rebellious house, say to you, ‘What are you doing?’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “As regards the chieftain, there is this pronouncement against Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in the midst of them.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Say, ‘I am a portent for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Just as I have done, that is the way it will be done to them. Into exile, into captivity they will go.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And as regards the chieftain who is in the midst of them, on the shoulder he will do carrying in the darkness and go out; through the wall they will bore in order to do the bringing forth through it. His face he will cover in order that he may not see with his own eye the earth.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I shall certainly spread my net over him, and he must be caught in my hunting net; and I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, but it he will not see; and there he will die.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And all who are round about him as a help, and all his military bands, I shall scatter to every wind; and a sword I shall draw out after them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I disperse them among the nations and I actually scatter them among the lands.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I will leave remaining from them a few men from the sword, from the famine and from the pestilence, in order that they may recount all their detestable things among the nations to whom they must come in; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Son of man, with quaking your bread you should eat, and with agitation and with anxious care your water you should drink.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And you must say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said to the inhabitants of Jerusalem upon the soil of Israel: “With anxious care their bread they will eat, and with horror their water they will drink, in order that its land may be laid desolate of its fullness because of the violence of all those dwelling in it.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the inhabited cities themselves will be devastated, and the land itself will become a mere desolate waste; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to know that I am Jehovah.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the word of Jehovah occurred further to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Son of man, what is this proverbial saying that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have on the soil of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision has perished’?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “I shall certainly cause this proverbial saying to cease, and they will no more say it as a proverb in Israel.”’ But speak to them, ‘The days have drawn near, and the matter of every vision.’</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For there will no more prove to be any valueless vision nor double-faced divination in the midst of the house of Israel.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">‘“For I myself, Jehovah, shall speak what word I shall speak, and it will be done. There will be no postponement anymore, for in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> days, O rebellious house, I shall speak a word and certainly do it,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“Son of man, look! those of the house of Israel are saying, ‘The vision that he is visioning is many days off, and respecting times far off he is prophesying.’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “‘There will be no postponement anymore as to any words of mine. What word I shall speak, it will even be done,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">And the word of Jehovah came further to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her detestable things.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you must say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth were from the land of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ite. Your father was the Am&acute;or&middot;ite, and your mother was a Hit&acute;tite.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And as regards your birth, on the day of your being born your navel string had not been cut, and in water you had not been washed for cleansing, and with salt you had not at all been rubbed, and by no means had you been swaddled.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">No eye felt sorry for you to do for you one of these things in compassion upon you, but you were thrown upon the surface of the field because there was an abhorring of your soul in the day of your being born.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘“And I came passing along by you and got to see you kicking about in your blood, and I proceeded to say to you in your blood, ‘Keep living!’ yes, to say to you in your blood, ‘Keep living!’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">A very big multitude like the sprouting of the field is what I made you so that you would grow big and become great and come in with the finest ornament. The two breasts themselves were firmly developed, and your own hair grew luxuriantly, when you had been naked and nude.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘And I came passing along by you and got to see you, and, look! your time was the time for love’s expressions. So I proceeded to spread my skirt over you and to cover your nudeness and to make a sworn statement to you and enter into a covenant with you,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and so you became mine.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Furthermore, I washed you with water and rinsed away your blood from off you and greased you with oil.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And I went on to clothe you with an embroidered garment and to shoe you with sealskin and to wrap you in fine linen and to cover you with costly material.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I went on to deck you with ornaments and to put bracelets upon your hands and a necklace about your throat.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Furthermore, I put a nose ring in your nostril and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And you kept decking yourself with gold and silver, and your attire was fine linen and costly material and an embroidered garment. Fine flour and honey and oil were what you ate, and you grew to be very, very pretty, and gradually you became fit for royal position.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘And for you a name began to go forth among the nations because of your prettiness, for it was perfect because of my splendor that I placed upon you,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“‘But you began to trust in your prettiness and become a prostitute on account of your name and to pour out your acts of prostitution on every passerby; his it came to be.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And you proceeded to take some of your garments and make for yourself high places of varied colors and you would prostitute yourself on them—such things are not coming in, and it should not happen.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And you would take your beautiful articles from my gold and from my silver that I had given to you and you would make for yourself images of a male and prostitute yourself with them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And you would take your embroidered garments and cover them; and my oil and my incense you would actually put before them.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And my bread that I had given to you—fine flour and oil and honey that I had had you eat—you also actually put it before them as a restful odor, and it continued to occur,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“‘And you would take your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to me, and you would sacrifice these to them to be devoured—is that not enough of your acts of prostitution?</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And you would slaughter my sons, and by making them pass through [the fire] you would give these to them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And in all your detestable things and your acts of prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth when you happened to be naked and nude; kicking about in your blood you happened to be.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So it came about after all your badness (“woe, woe to you,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah)</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">that you went building for yourself a mound and making for yourself a height in every public square.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At every head of the way you built your height and you began to make your prettiness something detestable and sprawl out your feet to every passerby and multiply your acts of prostitution.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And you went prostituting yourself to the sons of Egypt, your neighbors great of flesh, and you continued making your prostitution abound in order to offend me.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And, look! I shall certainly stretch out my hand against you and I shall diminish your allowance and give you to the soul[ful desire] of the women hating you, the daughters of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, the women humiliated on account of your way as regards loose conduct.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“‘And you went on to prostitute yourself to the sons of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a because there was no satisfying of you, and you kept prostituting yourself with them and also did not get satisfaction.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">So you kept making your prostitution abound toward the land of Ca&acute;naan, toward the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans; and even in this you did not get satisfaction.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">O how I am filled up with rage against you,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘by your doing all these things, the work of a woman, a domineering prostitute!</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">When you built your mound at the head of every way and you made your own height in every public square, yet you became unlike a prostitute in disdaining hire.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">In the case of the wife that commits adultery, she takes strangers instead of her own husband.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">To all prostitutes they are accustomed to give a present, but you—you have given your presents to all those passionately loving you, and you offer a bribe to them to come in to you from all around in your acts of prostitution.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And in your case the opposite thing takes place from that of other women in your acts of prostitution, and after your style no prostitution has been committed, even in your giving hire when no hire has been given to you, and so it occurs in the opposite way.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that your lustfulness has been poured out and your private parts are uncovered in your acts of prostitution toward those passionately loving you and toward all your detestable dungy idols, even with the blood of your sons whom you gave to them,</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">therefore here I am collecting together all those passionately loving you toward whom you were pleasurable and all those whom you loved along with all those whom you hated, and I will collect them together against you from all around and uncover your private parts to them, and they must see all your private parts.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“‘And I will judge you with the judgments of adulteresses and women shedding blood, and I will give you the blood of rage and jealousy.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And I will give you into their hand, and they will certainly tear down your mound and your heights will certainly be pulled down, and they must strip you of your garments and take your beautiful articles and leave you behind naked and nude.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And they must bring up against you a congregation and pelt you with stones and slaughter you with their swords.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And they must burn your houses with fire and execute in you acts of judgment before the eyes of many women; and I will cause you to cease from [being] a prostitute, and also no more hire will you give.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And I will bring my rage to its rest in you, and my jealousy must turn away from you; and I will stay quiet and I shall no more feel offended.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“‘For the reason that you did not remember the days of your youth and you would cause me agitation because of all these things, even here I also, for my part, will put your own way upon [your] very head,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and you will certainly not carry on any loose conduct alongside all your detestable things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“‘Look! Everyone using a proverb against you will use the proverb, saying: “Like mother is her daughter!”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">You are the daughter of your mother, one abhorring her husband and her sons. And you are the sister of your sisters, who abhorred their husbands and their sons. The mother of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> women was a Hit&acute;tite, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father was an Am&acute;or&middot;ite.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">“‘And your older sister is Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a herself with her dependent towns, who is dwelling on your left, and your sister younger than you, who is dwelling on your right, is Sod&acute;om with her dependent towns.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And it was not in their ways that you walked, nor according to their detestable things that you did. In a very little while you even began to act more ruinously than they did in all your ways.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">As I am alive,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘Sod&acute;om your sister, she with her dependent towns, has not done according to what you did, you and your dependent towns.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">Look! This is what proved to be the error of Sod&acute;om your sister: Pride, sufficiency of bread and the carefreeness of keeping undisturbed were what happened to belong to her and her dependent towns, and the hand of the afflicted one and the poor one she did not strengthen.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">And they continued to be haughty and to carry on a detestable thing before me, and I finally removed them, just as I saw [fit].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">“‘And as for Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, she has not sinned even up to half of your sins, but you kept making your detestable things abound more than they did, so that you made your sisters appear righteous because of all your detestable things that you carried on.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">You also, bear your humiliation when you must argue in favor of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more detestably than they did, they are more righteous than you. And you also, be ashamed and bear your humiliation in that you make your sisters appear righteous.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">“‘And I will gather their captive ones, the captive ones of Sod&acute;om and of her dependent towns, and the captive ones of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and of her dependent towns; I will also gather your captive ones in the midst of them,</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">in order that you may bear your humiliation; and you must feel humiliated owing to all that you have done, in that you comforted them.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">And your own sisters, Sod&acute;om and her dependent towns, will return to their former state, and Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and her dependent towns will return to their former state, and you yourself and your own dependent towns will return to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> former state.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">And Sod&acute;om your sister did not prove to be anything worth hearing about from your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">before your own badness got to be exposed, just as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and of all round about her, the daughters of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, those treating you with scorn on all sides.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">Your loose conduct and your detestable things, you yourself must bear them,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘I also must do with you just as you have done, because you despised the oath in breaking [my] covenant.</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">And I, I myself, must remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I must establish for you an indefinitely lasting covenant.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">And you will certainly remember your ways and feel humiliated when you receive your sisters, the ones older than you as well as the ones younger than you, and I shall certainly give them to you as daughters, but not owing to your covenant.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">“‘And I, I myself, will establish my covenant with you; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">in order that you may remember and actually be ashamed and you may no more come to have any reason to open [your] mouth because of your humiliation, when I make an atonement for you for all that you have done,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Son of man, propound a riddle and compose a proverbial saying toward the house of Israel.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you must say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “The great eagle, having great wings, with long pinions, full of plumage, which had color variety, came to Leb&acute;a&middot;non and proceeded to take the treetop of the cedar.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">He plucked off the very top of its young shoots and came bringing it to the land of Ca&acute;naan; in a city of traders he placed it.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Furthermore, he took some of the seed of the land and put it in a field for seed. As a willow by vast waters, as a willow tree he placed it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And it began to sprout and gradually became a luxuriantly growing vine low in height, inclined to turn its foliage inward; and as for its roots, they gradually came to be under it. And it finally became a vine and produced shoots and sent forth branches.</span>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘“And there came to be another great eagle, having great wings, and having large pinions, and, look! this very vine stretched its roots hungrily toward him.

       <span id="vs8">Into a good field, by vast waters, it was already transplanted, in order to produce boughs and to bear fruit, to become a majestic vine.”’</span>

Yes, I proceeded to lift up my hand [in an oath] to them, saying, ‘I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In that day I lifted up my hand [in an oath] to them to bring them forth from the land of Egypt to a land that I had spied out for them, one flowing with milk and honey. It was the decoration of all the lands.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>

       <span id="vs22">In his right hand the divination proved to be for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open one’s mouth for a slaying, to raise the sound in an alarm signal, to set battering rams against gates, to throw up a siege rampart, to build a siege wall.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And it has become to them like an untrue divination in their eyes—those who are sworn with oaths to them; and he is calling error to remembrance, in order [for them] to be caught.</span>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“And O&middot;ho&acute;lah began to prostitute herself, while subject to me, and kept lusting after those passionately loving her, after the As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;ans, who were near,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">governors clothed with blue material, and deputy rulers—desirable young men all of them, cavalrymen riding horses.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And she continued giving forth her prostitutions upon them, the choicest sons of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a all of them; and with all those after whom she lusted—with their dungy idols—she defiled herself.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And her prostitutions [carried] from Egypt she did not leave, for with her they had lain down in her youth, and they were the ones that pressed the bosoms of her virginity and they kept pouring out their immoral intercourse upon her.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Therefore I gave her into the hand of those passionately loving her, into the hand of the sons of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, toward whom she had lusted.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">They were the ones that uncovered her nakedness. Her sons and her daughters they took, and her they killed even with sword. And she came to be infamy to women, and acts of judgment were what they executed upon her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“When her sister O&middot;hol&acute;i&middot;bah got to see [it], then she exercised her sensual desire more ruinously than she, and her prostitution more than the fornication of her sister.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For the sons of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a she lusted, governors and deputy rulers who were near, clothed with perfect taste, cavalrymen riding horses—desirable young men all of them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I got to see that, because she had defiled herself, both of them had one way.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And she kept adding to her acts of prostitution when she got to see the men in carvings upon the wall, images of Chal&middot;de&acute;ans carved in vermilion,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">girded with belts on their hips, with pendant turbans on their heads, having the appearance of warriors, all of them, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, Chal&middot;de&acute;ans as respects the land of their birth.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And she began to lust after them at the sight of her eyes and proceeded to send messengers to them in Chal&middot;de&acute;a.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the sons of Babylon kept coming in to her, to the bed of expressions of love, and defiling her with their immoral intercourse; and she continued getting defiled by them, and her soul began to turn away disgusted from them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“And she went on uncovering her acts of prostitution and uncovering her nakedness, so that my soul turned away disgusted from company with her, just as my soul had turned away disgusted from company with her sister.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And she kept multiplying her acts of prostitution to the point of calling to mind the days of her youth, when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And she kept lusting in the style of concubines belonging to those whose fleshly member is as the fleshly member of male asses and whose genital organ is as the genital organ of male horses.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And you continued calling attention to the loose conduct of your youth by the pressing of your bosoms from Egypt onward, for the sake of the breasts of your youth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Therefore, O O&middot;hol&acute;i&middot;bah, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am rousing up your passionate lovers against you, those from whom your soul has turned away in disgust, and I will bring them in against you on all sides,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">the sons of Babylon and all the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, Pe&acute;kod and Sho&acute;a and Ko&acute;a, all the sons of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a with them, desirable young men, governors and deputy rulers all of them, warriors and summoned ones, riding on horses, all of them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they must come in against you with rattling of war chariots and wheels, and with a congregation of peoples, with large shield and buckler and helmet. They will set themselves against you all around, and I will give judgment over to them, and they must judge you with their judgments.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And I will express my ardor against you, and they must take action against you in rage. Your nose and your ears they will remove, and the remainder of you will fall even by the sword. Your sons and your daughters they themselves will take, and the remainder of you will be devoured by the fire.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they will certainly strip off you your garments and take away your beautiful articles.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And I shall actually cause your loose conduct to cease from you, and your prostitution [carried] from the land of Egypt; and you will not raise your eyes to them, and Egypt you will remember no more.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am giving you into the hand of those whom you have hated, into the hand of those from whom your soul has turned away disgusted.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And they must take action against you in hatred and take away all your product of toil and leave you naked and nude; and the nudeness of your acts of fornication and your loose conduct and your acts of prostitution must be uncovered.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">There will be a doing of these things to you because of your going like a prostitute after [the] nations, on account of the fact that you defiled yourself with their dungy idols.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In the way of your sister you have walked; and I shall have to give her cup into your hand.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘The cup of your sister you will drink, the deep and wide one. You will become an object of laughter and derision, [the cup] containing much.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">With drunkenness and grief you will be filled, with the cup of astonishment and of desolation, the cup of your sister Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And you will have to drink it and drain [it] out, and its earthenware fragments you will gnaw, and your breasts you will tear out. “For I myself have spoken,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that you have forgotten me and you proceeded to cast me behind your back, then you yourself also bear your loose conduct and your acts of prostitution.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Son of man, will you judge O&middot;ho&acute;lah and O&middot;hol&acute;i&middot;bah and tell them their detestable things?</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">For they have committed adultery and there is blood on their hands, and with their dungy idols they have committed adultery. And, besides that, their sons whom they had borne to me they made pass through [the fire] to them as food.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">What is more, this is what they have done to me: They have defiled my sanctuary in that day, and my sabbaths they have profaned.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And when they had slaughtered their sons to their dungy idols they even proceeded to come into my sanctuary on that day to profane it, and, look! that is what they have done in the midst of my house.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And in addition to that, when they began to send to the men coming from far away, to whom there was sent a messenger, then, look! they came, for whom you had washed yourself, painted your eyes and decked yourself with ornaments.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And you sat down upon a glorious couch, with a table set in order before it, and my incense and my oil you put upon it.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And the sound of a crowd at ease was in her, and to the men out of the mass of mankind there were drunkards being brought in from the wilderness, and they proceeded to put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“Then I said respecting her who was worn out with adultery, ‘Now she will keep on committing her prostitution, even she herself.’</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And they kept on coming in to her, just as one comes in to a woman that is a prostitute; in that manner they came in to O&middot;ho&acute;lah and to O&middot;hol&acute;i&middot;bah as women of loose conduct.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">But as regards righteous men, they are the ones that will judge her with the judgment for adulteresses and with the judgment for female shedders of blood; for adulteresses are what they are, and there is blood on their hands.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘There will be the bringing up of a congregation against them and a making of them a frightful object and something to plunder.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And the congregation must pelt them with stones, and there will be a cutting of them down with their swords. Their sons and their daughters they will kill, and with fire their houses they will burn.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And I shall certainly cause loose conduct to cease out of the land, and all the women will have to let themselves be corrected, so that they will not do according to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> loose conduct.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And they must bring <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> loose conduct upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and the sins of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dungy idols <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will bear; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’”</span>

       <span id="vs10">Therefore here I am against you and against your Nile canals, and I will make the land of Egypt devastated places, dryness, a desolated waste, from Mig&acute;dol to Sy&middot;e&acute;ne and to the boundary of E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs18">“Son of man, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar himself, the king of Babylon, made his military force perform a great service against Tyre.

       <span id="vs3">Look! An As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;an, a cedar in Leb&acute;a&middot;non, pretty in bough, with a woody thicket offering shadow, and high in stature, so that among the clouds its treetop proved to be.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Waters were what made it get big; the watery deep caused it to grow high. With its streams it was going all around its planting place; and its channels it sent forth to all the trees of the field.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">That is why it grew higher in its stature than all the [other] trees of the field.</span>

       <span id="vs7">And it came to be pretty in its greatness, in the length of its foliage, for its root system proved to be over many waters.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">[Other] cedars were no match for it in the garden of God. As for juniper trees, they bore no resemblance as respects its boughs.

       <span id="vs9">Pretty is the way that I made it in the abundance of its foliage, and all the [other] trees of E&acute;den that were in the garden of the [true] God kept envying it.’</span>

       <span id="vs13">Upon its fallen trunk all the flying creatures of the heavens will reside, and upon its branches there will certainly come to be all the wild beasts of the field;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">to the end that none of the watered trees may become high in their stature, or put their treetops even among the clouds, and that none drinking water may stand up against them in their height, for they will certainly all of them be given to death, to the land down below, in the midst of the sons of mankind, to those going down into the pit.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs16">At the sound of its downfall I shall certainly cause nations to rock when I bring it down to She&acute;ol with those going down into the pit, and in the land down below all the trees of E&acute;den, the choicest and the best of Leb&acute;a&middot;non, all those drinking water, will be comforted.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

But you will certainly be brought down with the trees of E&acute;den to the land down below. In the midst of the uncircumcised ones you will lie down with those slain by the sword. This is Phar&acute;aoh and all his crowd,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Son of man, speak to the sons of your people, and you must say to them,</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">“‘As regards a land, in case I bring upon it a sword and the people of the land, one and all, actually take a man and set him as their watchman,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and he really sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the horn and warns the people,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and the hearer actually hears the sound of the horn but he takes no warning at all, and a sword comes and takes him away, his own blood will come to be upon his own head.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The sound of the horn he heard, but he took no warning. His own blood will come to be upon his own self. And had he himself taken warning, his own soul would have escaped.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘Now as regards the watchman, in case he sees the sword coming and he actually does not blow the horn and the people itself gets no warning at all and a sword comes and takes away from them soul, for its own error it itself must be taken away, but its blood I shall ask back from the hand of the watchman himself.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Now as regards you, O son of man, a watchman is what I have made you to the house of Israel, and at my mouth you must hear [the] word and give them warning from me.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When I say to someone wicked, ‘O wicked one, you will positively die!’ but you actually do not speak out to warn the wicked one from his way, he himself as a wicked one will die in his own error, but his blood I shall ask back at your own hand.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But as regards you, in case you actually warn someone wicked from his way [for him] to turn back from it but he actually does not turn back from his way, he himself will die in his own error, whereas you yourself will certainly deliver your own soul.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Now as regards you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have said: “Because our revolts and our sins are upon us and in them we are rotting away, how, then, shall we keep living?”’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Say to them, ‘“As I am alive,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, “I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living. Turn back, turn back from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bad ways, for why is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should die, O house of Israel?”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“And as for you, O son of man, say to the sons of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous one will not itself deliver him in the day of his revolt. But as regards the wickedness of the wicked one, he will not be made to stumble by it in the day of his turning back from his wickedness. Nor will even anyone having righteousness be able to keep living because of it in the day of his sinning.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">When I say to the righteous one: “You will positively keep living,” and he himself actually trusts in his own righteousness and does injustice, all his own righteous acts will not be remembered, but for his injustice that he has done—for this he will die.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘And when I say to the wicked one: “You will positively die,” and he actually turns back from his sin and carries on justice and righteousness,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">[and] the wicked one returns the very thing pledged, pays back the very things taken by robbery, [and] actually walks in the very statutes of life by not doing injustice, he will positively keep living. He will not die.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">None of his sins with which he has sinned will be remembered against him. Justice and righteousness are what he has carried on. He will positively keep living.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And the sons of your people have said, ‘The way of Jehovah is not adjusted right,’ but, as for them, it is their way that is not adjusted right.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“When someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and actually does injustice, he must also die for them.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And when someone wicked turns back from his wickedness and actually carries on justice and righteousness, it will be on account of them that he himself will keep living.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have said, ‘The way of Jehovah is not adjusted right.’ It will be each one according to his ways that I shall judge <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, O house of Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At length it occurred in the twelfth year, in the tenth [month], on the fifth day of the month of our exile, that there came to me the escaped one from Jerusalem, saying: “The city has been struck down!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Now the very hand of Jehovah had come to be upon me in the evening before the coming of the escaped one, and He proceeded to open my mouth prior to [that one’s] coming to me in the morning, and my mouth was opened and I proved to be speechless no longer.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the word of Jehovah began to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Son of man, the inhabitants of these devastated places are saying even concerning the soil of Israel, ‘Abraham happened to be just one and yet he took possession of the land. And we are many; to us the land has been given as something to possess.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “With the blood <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep eating, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep lifting to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dungy idols, and blood <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep pouring out. So should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> possess the land?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have depended upon <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sword. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have done a detestable thing, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have defiled each one the wife of his companion. So should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> possess the land?”’</span>

       <span id="vs18">And I proceeded to pour out my rage upon them on account of the blood that they had poured out upon the land, which [land] they had made unclean with their dungy idols.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I proceeded to scatter them among the nations, so that they were dispersed among the lands. According to their way and according to their dealings I judged them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So they came in to the nations where they came in, and people proceeded to profane my holy name in saying with reference to them, ‘These are the people of Jehovah, and from his land they have gone out.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And I shall have compassion on my holy name, which the house of Israel have profaned among the nations where they have come in.”</span>

       <span id="vs24">And I will take <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of the nations and collect <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> together out of all the lands and bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in upon <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> soil.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>

       <span id="vs26">And I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a new heart, and a new spirit I shall put inside <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I will take away the heart of stone from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flesh and give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a heart of flesh.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And my spirit I shall put inside <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I will act so that in my regulations <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will walk, and my judicial decisions <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will keep and actually carry out.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly dwell in the land that I gave to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must become my people and I myself shall become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’</span>

       <span id="vs30">And I shall certainly make the fruitage of the tree abound, and the produce of the field, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may no more receive among the nations the reproach of famine.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be bound to remember <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bad ways and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings that were not good, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be bound to feel a loathing at <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own person on account of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> errors and on account of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> detestable things.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Not for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sakes am I doing [this],’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘let it be known to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.

</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>

       <span id="vs34">And the desolated land itself will be cultivated, whereas it had become a desolate waste before the eyes of every passerby.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And people will certainly say: “That land yonder which was laid desolate has become like the garden of E&acute;den, and the cities that were a waste and that were laid desolate and that were torn down are fortified; they have become inhabited.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And the nations that will be left remaining round about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have built the things torn down, I have planted what has been laid desolate. I myself, Jehovah, have spoken and I have done [it].’</span>

       <span id="vs38">Like a flock of holy persons, like the flock of Jerusalem in her festal seasons, thus the cities that had been a waste will become full of a flock of men; and people will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he had me pass along by them all round about, and, look! there were very many on the surface of the valley plain and, look! they were very dry.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he began to say to me: “Son of man, can these bones come to life?” To that I said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you yourself well know.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs19">speak to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am taking the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of E&acute;phra&middot;im, and the tribes of Israel his partners, and I will put them upon it, that is, the stick of Judah, and I shall actually make them one stick, and they must become one in my hand.”’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, in the start of the year, on the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been struck down, on this very same day the hand of Jehovah proved to be upon me, so that he brought me to that place.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">In the visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel and gradually set me down upon a very high mountain, on which there was something like the structure of a city to the south.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he proceeded to bring me there, and, look! there was a man. His appearance was like the appearance of copper, and there was a flax cord in his hand, and a measuring reed, and he was standing in the gate.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the man began to speak to me: “Son of man, see with your eyes, and with your ears hear, and set your heart upon all that I am showing you, because for the purpose of [my] showing you, you have been brought here. Tell everything that you are seeing to the house of Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And, look! there was a wall outside the house all round about. And in the hand of the man there was the measuring reed of six cubits, by a cubit and a handbreadth. And he began to measure the breadth of the thing built, one reed; and the height, one reed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then he came to the gate, the front of which is toward the east, and went up by its steps. And he began to measure the threshold of the gate, one reed in width, and the other threshold, one reed in width.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the guard chamber was one reed in length and one reed in width, and between the guard chambers there were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate beside the porch of the gate toward the interior was one reed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he proceeded to measure the porch of the gate toward the interior, one reed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the interior.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the guard chambers of the gate toward the east were three on this side and three on that side. The three of them were of the same measurement, and the side pillars were of the same measurement, on this side and on that side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits; the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the fenced area in front of the guard chambers was one cubit, and there was a fenced area of one cubit on [either] side. And the guard chamber was six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he went on to measure the gate from the roof of the [one] guard chamber to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits; entrance was across from entrance.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then he made side pillars of sixty cubits, even to the side pillar[s] of the courtyard in the gate[s] all around.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And by the front of the gate of the entryway [to] by the front of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And there were windows of narrowing frames for the guard chambers and for their side pillars toward the inside of the gate all around, and that is the way it was for the porches. And the windows were all around toward the inside, and on the side pillars there were palm-tree figures.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he gradually brought me into the outer courtyard, and, look! there were dining rooms, and a pavement made for the courtyard all around. There were thirty dining rooms upon the pavement.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the pavement at the side of the gates was exactly as the length of the gates—the lower pavement.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he proceeded to measure the width from in front of the lower gate to the front of the inner courtyard. Outside it was a hundred cubits, to the east and to the north.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the outer courtyard had a gate the front of which was toward the north. He measured its length and its width.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And its guard chambers were three on this side and three on that side. And its own side pillars and its own porch proved to be according to the measurement of the first gate. Fifty cubits was its length, and its width was twenty-five in cubits.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And its windows and its porch and its palm-tree figures were of the same measurement as those of the gate the front of which is toward the east. And by seven steps people could go up into it, and its porch was to their front.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the gate of the inner courtyard was opposite the gate to the north; also [one] to the east. And he proceeded to measure from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he gradually brought me toward the south, and, look! there was a gate toward the south, and he measured its side pillars and its porch as of the same measurements as these.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And it and its porch had windows all around, like these windows. Fifty cubits was the length, and the breadth was twenty-five cubits.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And there were seven steps for going up to it, and its porch was to their front. And it had palm-tree figures, one on this side and one on that side on its side pillars.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the inner courtyard had a gate toward the south. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And he gradually brought me into the inner courtyard by the gate of the south. And he proceeded to measure the gate of the south as of the same measurements as these.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And its guard chambers and its side pillars and its porch were of the same measurements as these. And it and its porch had windows round about. Fifty cubits was the length, and the width was twenty-five cubits.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And there were porches all around; the length was twenty-five cubits, and the width five cubits.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And its porch was to the outer courtyard, and palm-tree figures were on its side pillars, and its ascent was eight steps.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And he gradually brought me into the inner courtyard by way of the east, and he proceeded to measure the gate as of the same measurements as these.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And its guard chambers and its side pillars and its porch were of the same measurements as these, and it and its porch had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And its porch was toward the outer courtyard, and palm-tree figures were on its side pillars on this side and on that side. And its ascent was eight steps.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And he proceeded to bring me into the north gate, and he measured, with the same measurements as these,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">its guard chambers, its side pillars and its porch. And it had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And to the outer courtyard were its side pillars, and palm-tree figures were on its side pillars on this side and on that side. And its ascent was eight steps.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And a dining room with its entrance was by the side pillars of the gates. There it was that they would rinse the whole burnt offering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And in the porch of the gate there were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, for slaughtering upon them the whole burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And on the outer side, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables. And on the other side that belongs to the porch of the gate there were two tables.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">There were four tables over here and four tables over there at the side of the gate—eight tables, upon which they would do the slaughtering.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And the four tables for the whole burnt offering were of hewn stone. The length was one cubit and a half, and the width one cubit and a half, and the height one cubit. Upon them they would also deposit the implements with which they would slaughter the whole burnt offering and the sacrifice.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And the ledges for setting down things were of one handbreadth, firmly fixed on the interior, all around; and upon the tables [they would deposit] the flesh of the gift offering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And on the outside of the inner gate there were the dining rooms of the singers, in the inner courtyard, which is on the side of the north gate. And their front side was toward the south. There was one on the side of the east gate. The front was toward the north.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And he proceeded to speak to me: “This one, the dining room the front of which is toward the south, is for the priests who are taking care of the obligation of the house.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And the dining room the front of which is toward the north is for the priests who are taking care of the obligation of the altar. They are the sons of Za&acute;dok, who, from the sons of Le&acute;vi, are approaching Jehovah to minister to him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And he went measuring the [inner] courtyard. The length was a hundred cubits, and the width a hundred cubits, foursquare. And the altar was before the house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And he proceeded to bring me into the porch of the house, and he went measuring the side pillar of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side. And the width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits. And by steps was how they would go up to it. And there were pillars by the side posts, one over here and one over there.</span>

       <span id="vs9">And when the people of the land come in before Jehovah in the festal seasons, the one coming in by the way of the north gate in order to bow down should go out by the way of the south gate; and the one coming in by the way of the south gate should go out by the way of the gate to the north. No one should go back by the way of the gate by which he came in, for he should go out straight ahead of him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs17">And in case he should give a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it must also become his until the year of liberty; and it must return to the chieftain.

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he proceeded to bring me in by the entryway that was by the side of the gate to the holy dining rooms, those belonging to the priests, that were facing to the north, and, look! there was a place there on both rear sides to the west.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he proceeded to say to me: “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, [and] where they will bake the grain offering, in order to carry nothing out to the outer courtyard so as to sanctify the people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he proceeded to bring me out to the outer courtyard and make me pass along to the four corner posts of the courtyard, and, look! there was a courtyard by [this] corner post of the courtyard, a courtyard by [that] corner post of the courtyard.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At the four corner posts of the courtyard there were small courtyards, forty [cubits] in length and thirty in width. The four of them with corner structures had the same measurement.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And there was a row round about them, round about the four of them, and there were boiling places made beneath the rows round about.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then he said to me: “These are the houses of those doing the boiling, where the ministers of the House boil the sacrifice of the people.”</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he gradually brought me forth by the way of the north gate and took me around by the way outside to the outer gate that is facing toward the east, and, look! water was trickling from the right-hand side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">When the man went forth eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he also proceeded to measure a thousand in cubits and to make me pass through the water, water [up] to the ankles.</span>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he continued measuring a thousand and then made me pass through the water, water [up] to the knees.</span>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he continued measuring a thousand. It was a torrent that I was not able to pass through, for the water had got high, water [permitting] swimming, a torrent that could not be passed through.</span>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that he said to me: “Have you seen [this], O son of man?”</span>

       <span id="vs8">And he went on to say to me: “This water is going forth to the eastern region and must go down through the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah. And it must come to the sea.

       <span id="vs10">“And it must occur that fishers will actually stand alongside it from En-ge&acute;di even up to En-eg&acute;la&middot;im. There will come to be a drying yard for dragnets. In their kinds their fish will prove to be, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.</span>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“And alongside the torrent there will come up, along its bank on this side and on that side, all sorts of trees for food. Their leafage will not wither, nor will their fruitage be consumed. In their months they will bear new fruit, because the water for them—it is coming forth from the very sanctuary. And their fruitage must prove to be for food and their leafage for healing.”</span>

This is the eastern side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“And the southern side is to the south, from Ta&acute;mar to the waters of Mer&acute;i&middot;bath-ka&acute;desh, the torrent valley to the Great Sea. This is the side to the south, toward the Neg&acute;eb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And the western side is the Great Sea, from the boundary straight ahead to the entering in to Ha&acute;math. This is the western side.”</span>
