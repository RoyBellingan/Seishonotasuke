<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Whereas many have undertaken to compile a statement of the facts that are given full credence among us,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">just as those who from [the] beginning became eyewitnesses and attendants of the message delivered these to us,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">I resolved also, because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them in logical order to you, most excellent The&middot;oph&acute;i&middot;lus,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In the days of Herod, king of Ju&middot;de&acute;a, there happened to be a certain priest named Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah of the division of A&middot;bi&acute;jah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">They both were righteous before God because of walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well along in years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now as he was acting as priest in the assignment of his division before God,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">according to the solemn practice of the priestly office it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and all the multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of offering incense.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">To him Jehovah’s angel appeared, standing at the right side of the incense altar.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah became troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">However, the angel said to him: “Have no fear, Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah, because your supplication has been favorably heard, and your wife Elizabeth will become mother to a son to you, and you are to call his name John.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And you will have joy and great gladness, and many will rejoice over his birth;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">for he will be great before Jehovah. But he must drink no wine and strong drink at all, and he will be filled with holy spirit right from his mother’s womb;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and many of the sons of Israel will he turn back to Jehovah their God.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Also, he will go before him with E&middot;li&acute;jah’s spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah said to the angel: “How am I to be sure of this? For I am aged and my wife is well along in years.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In reply the angel said to him: “I am Ga&acute;bri&middot;el, who stands near before God, and I was sent forth to speak with you and declare the good news of these things to you.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But, look! you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their appointed time.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Meanwhile the people continued waiting for Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah, and they began to wonder at his delaying in the sanctuary.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary; and he kept making signs to them, but remained dumb.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">When, now, the days of his public service were fulfilled, he went off to his home.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But after these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant; and she kept herself secluded for five months, saying:</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“This is the way Jehovah has dealt with me in these days when he has given me his attention to take away my reproach among men.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In her sixth month the angel Ga&acute;bri&middot;el was sent forth from God to a city of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee named Naz&acute;a&middot;reth,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David’s house; and the name of the virgin was Mary.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And when he went in before her he said: “Good day, highly favored one, Jehovah is with you.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But she was deeply disturbed at the saying and began to reason out what sort of greeting this might be.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So the angel said to her: “Have no fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God;</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">and, look! you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But Mary said to the angel: “How is this to be, since I am having no intercourse with a man?”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And, look! Elizabeth your relative has also herself conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her, the so-called barren woman;</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">because with God no declaration will be an impossibility.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then Mary said: “Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! May it take place with me according to your declaration.” At that the angel departed from her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So Mary rose in these days and went into the mountainous country with haste, to a city of Judah,</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">and she entered into the home of Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Well, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">and she called out with a loud cry and said: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">So how is it that this [privilege] is mine, to have the mother of my Lord come to me?</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">For, look! as the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears, the infant in my womb leaped with great gladness.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Happy too is she that believed, because there will be a complete performance of those things spoken to her from Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And Mary said: “My soul magnifies Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at God my Savior;</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl. For, look! from now on all generations will pronounce me happy;</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">because the powerful One has done great deeds for me, and holy is his name;</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">and for generations after generations his mercy is upon those who fear him.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">He has performed mightily with his arm, he has scattered abroad those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">He has brought down men of power from thrones and exalted lowly ones;</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">he has fully satisfied hungry ones with good things and he has sent away empty those who had wealth.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">He has come to the aid of Israel his servant, to call to mind mercy,</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">just as he told to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his seed, forever.”</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">Then Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own home.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">The time now became due for Elizabeth to give birth, and she became mother to a son.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">And the neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah had magnified his mercy to her, and they began to rejoice with her.</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child, and they were going to call it by the name of its father, Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">But its mother answered and said: “No, indeed! but he shall be called John.”</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">At this they said to her: “There is no one among your relatives that is called by this name.”</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">Then they went asking its father by signs what he wanted it to be called.</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">And he asked for a tablet and wrote: “John is its name.” At this they all marveled.</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">Instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he began to speak, blessing God.</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">And fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood; and in the whole mountainous country of Ju&middot;de&acute;a all these things began to be talked around,</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">and all that heard made note of it in their hearts, saying: “What really will this young child be?” For the hand of Jehovah was indeed with it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">And Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah its father was filled with holy spirit, and he prophesied, saying:</span> <a name="bk68" class="vsAnchor">68</a>
       <span id="vs68">“Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention and performed deliverance toward his people.</span> <a name="bk69" class="vsAnchor">69</a>
       <span id="vs69">And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,</span> <a name="bk70" class="vsAnchor">70</a>
       <span id="vs70">just as he, through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, has spoken</span> <a name="bk71" class="vsAnchor">71</a>
       <span id="vs71">of a salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us;</span> <a name="bk72" class="vsAnchor">72</a>
       <span id="vs72">to perform the mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant,</span> <a name="bk73" class="vsAnchor">73</a>
       <span id="vs73">the oath that he swore to Abraham our forefather,</span> <a name="bk74" class="vsAnchor">74</a>
       <span id="vs74">to grant us, after we have been rescued from the hands of enemies, the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him</span> <a name="bk75" class="vsAnchor">75</a>
       <span id="vs75">with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days.</span> <a name="bk76" class="vsAnchor">76</a>
       <span id="vs76">But as for you, young child, you will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go in advance before Jehovah to make his ways ready,</span> <a name="bk77" class="vsAnchor">77</a>
       <span id="vs77">to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins,</span> <a name="bk78" class="vsAnchor">78</a>
       <span id="vs78">because of the tender compassion of our God. With this [compassion] a daybreak will visit us from on high,</span> <a name="bk79" class="vsAnchor">79</a>
       <span id="vs79">to give light to those sitting in darkness and death’s shadow, to direct our feet prosperously in the way of peace.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk80" class="vsAnchor">80</a>
       <span id="vs80">And the young child went on growing and getting strong in spirit, and he continued in the deserts until the day of showing himself openly to Israel.</span>

       <span id="vs9">And suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood by them, and Jehovah’s glory gleamed around them, and they became very fearful.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But the angel said to them: “Have no fear, for, look! I am declaring to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> good news of a great joy that all the people will have,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">because there was born to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> today a Savior, who is Christ [the] Lord, in David’s city.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And this is a sign for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will find an infant bound in cloth bands and lying in a manger.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And suddenly there came to be with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: “Let us by all means go clear to Beth&acute;le&middot;hem and see this thing that has taken place, which Jehovah has made known to us.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And they went with haste and found Mary as well as Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When they saw it, they made known the saying that had been spoken to them concerning this young child.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And all that heard marveled over the things told them by the shepherds,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">but Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all the things they heard and saw, just as these had been told them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Now when eight days came to the full for circumcising him, his name was also called Jesus, the name called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Also, when the days for purifying them according to the law of Moses came to the full, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">just as it is written in Jehovah’s law: “Every male opening a womb must be called holy to Jehovah,”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and to offer sacrifice according to what is said in the law of Jehovah: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And, look! there was a man in Jerusalem named Sim&acute;e&middot;on, and this man was righteous and reverent, waiting for Israel’s consolation, and holy spirit was upon him.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Furthermore, it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Under the power of the spirit he now came into the temple; and as the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for it according to the customary practice of the law,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">he himself received it into his arms and blessed God and said:</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go free in peace according to your declaration;</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">because my eyes have seen your means of saving</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">that you have made ready in the sight of all the peoples,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And its father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about it.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Also, Sim&acute;e&middot;on blessed them, but said to Mary its mother: “Look! This one is laid for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign to be talked against</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">(yes, a long sword will be run through the soul of you yourself), in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be uncovered.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Now there was Anna a prophetess, Phan&acute;u&middot;el’s daughter, of Ash&acute;er’s tribe (this woman was well along in years, and had lived with a husband for seven years from her virginity,</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">and she was a widow now eighty-four years old), who was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And in that very hour she came near and began returning thanks to God and speaking about [the child] to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So when they had carried out all the things according to the law of Jehovah, they went back into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee to their own city Naz&acute;a&middot;reth.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And the young child continued growing and getting strong, being filled with wisdom, and God’s favor continued upon him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Now his parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem for the festival of the passover.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And when he became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">and completed the days. But when they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Assuming that he was in the company traveling together, they covered a day’s distance and then began to hunt him up among the relatives and acquaintances.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">But, not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, making a diligent search for him.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and questioning them.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Now when they saw him they were astounded, and his mother said to him: “Child, why did you treat us this way? Here your father and I in mental distress have been looking for you.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">But he said to them: “Why did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have to go looking for me? Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that I must be in the [house] of my Father?”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">However, they did not grasp the saying that he spoke to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">And he went down with them and came to Naz&acute;a&middot;reth, and he continued subject to them. Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Ti&middot;be&acute;ri&middot;us Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Ju&middot;de&acute;a, and Herod was district ruler of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, but Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of It&middot;u&middot;rae&acute;a and Trach&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;tis, and Ly&middot;sa&acute;ni&middot;as was district ruler of Ab&middot;i&middot;le&acute;ne,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">in the days of chief priest An&acute;nas and of Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas, God’s declaration came to John the son of Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah in the wilderness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism [in symbol] of repentance for forgiveness of sins,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, make his roads straight.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Every gully must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled down, and the curves must become straight ways and the rough places smooth ways;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and all flesh will see the saving means of God.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> offspring of vipers, who has intimated to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Therefore produce fruits that befit repentance. And do not start saying within yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that God has power to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Indeed, the ax is already in position at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, not producing fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the crowds would ask him: “What, then, shall we do?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In reply he would say to them: “Let the man that has two undergarments share with the man that has none, and let him that has things to eat do the same.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what shall we do?”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">He said to them: “Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Also, those in military service would ask him: “What shall we also do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely, but be satisfied with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> provisions.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now as the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John: “May he perhaps be the Christ?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">John gave the answer, saying to all: “I, for my part, baptize <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with water; but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not fit to untie. He will baptize <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people with holy spirit and fire.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Therefore he also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But Herod the district ruler, for being reproved by him concerning He&middot;ro&acute;di&middot;as the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod did,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">added also this to all those [deeds]: he locked John up in prison.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized and, as he was praying, the heaven was opened up</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Furthermore, Jesus himself, when he commenced [his work], was about thirty years old, being the son, as the opinion was,<br><span class="p">of Joseph,</span><br><span class="p">[son] of He&acute;li,</span></span>

<p class="title">Luke 4:1-44</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="44">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan, and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">for forty days, while being tempted by the Devil. Furthermore, he ate nothing in those days, and so, when they were concluded, he felt hungry.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At this the Devil said to him: “If you are a son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But Jesus replied to him: “It is written, ‘Man must not live by bread alone.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and the Devil said to him: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In reply Jesus said to him: “It is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now he led him into Jerusalem and stationed him upon the battlement of the temple and said to him: “If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down from here;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">for it is written, ‘He will give his angels a charge concerning you, to preserve you,’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and, ‘They will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">In answer Jesus said to him: “It is said, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So the Devil, having concluded all the temptation, retired from him until another convenient time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee. And good talk concerning him spread out through all the surrounding country.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Also, he began to teach in their synagogues, being held in honor by all.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he came to Naz&acute;a&middot;reth, where he had been reared; and, according to his custom on the sabbath day, he entered into the synagogue, and he stood up to read.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed him, and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed upon him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then he started to say to them: “Today this scripture that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> just heard is fulfilled.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And they all began to give favorable witness about him and to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth, and they were saying: “This is a son of Joseph, is it not?”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At this he said to them: “No doubt <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will apply this illustration to me, ‘Physician, cure yourself; the things we heard as having happened in Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um do also here in your home territory.’”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But he said: “Truly I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that no prophet is accepted in his home territory.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For instance, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in truth, There were many widows in Israel in the days of E&middot;li&acute;jah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, so that a great famine fell upon all the land,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">yet E&middot;li&acute;jah was sent to none of those [women], but only to Zar&acute;e&middot;phath in the land of Si&acute;don to a widow.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Also, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of E&middot;li&acute;sha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, but Na&acute;a&middot;man the man of Syria.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">and they rose up and hurried him outside the city, and they led him to the brow of the mountain upon which their city had been built, in order to throw him down headlong.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But he went through the midst of them and continued on his way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And he went down to Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, a city of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath;</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">and they were astounded at his way of teaching, because his speech was with authority.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Now in the synagogue there was a man with a spirit, an unclean demon, and he shouted with a loud voice:</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“Ah! What have we to do with you, Jesus you Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute;? Did you come to destroy us? I know exactly who you are, the Holy One of God.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">But Jesus rebuked it, saying: “Be silent, and come out of him.” So, after throwing the man down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">At this, astonishment fell upon all, and they began to converse with one another, saying: “What sort of speech is this, because with authority and power he orders the unclean spirits, and out they come?”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">So the news concerning him kept going out into every corner of the surrounding country.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">After getting up out of the synagogue he entered into Simon’s home. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was distressed with a high fever, and they made request of him for her.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Instantly she rose and began ministering to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But when the sun was setting, all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. By laying his hands upon each one of them he would cure them.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Demons also would come out of many, crying out and saying: “You are the Son of God.” But, rebuking them, he would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">However, when it became day, he went out and proceeded to a lonely place. But the crowds began hunting about for him and came out as far as he was, and they tried to detain him from going away from them.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">But he said to them: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Accordingly he went on preaching in the synagogues of Ju&middot;de&acute;a.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="39">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">On an occasion when the crowd was pressing close upon him and listening to the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gen&middot;nes&acute;a&middot;ret.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside, but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Going aboard one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to pull away a bit from land. Then he sat down, and from the boat he began teaching the crowds.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When he ceased speaking, he said to Simon: “Pull out to where it is deep, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men let down <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> nets for a catch.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But Simon in reply said: “Instructor, for a whole night we toiled and took nothing, but at your bidding I will lower the nets.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Well, when they did this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish. In fact, their nets began ripping apart.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them; and they did come, and they filled both boats, so that these began to sink.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying: “Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, Lord.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For at the catch of fish which they took up astonishment overwhelmed him and all those with him,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and likewise both James and John, Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee’s sons, who were sharers with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon: “Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching men alive.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So they brought the boats back to land, and abandoned everything and followed him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">On a further occasion while he was in one of the cities, look! a man full of leprosy! When he caught sight of Jesus he fell upon his face and begged him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And so, stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to. Be made clean.” And immediately the leprosy vanished from him.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he gave the man orders to tell nobody: “But go off and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering in connection with your cleansing, just as Moses directed, for a witness to them.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But the word about him was spreading the more, and great crowds would come together to listen and to be cured of their sicknesses.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, he continued in retirement in the deserts and praying.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In the course of one of the days he was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law who had come out of every village of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee and Ju&middot;de&acute;a and Jerusalem were sitting there; and Jehovah’s power was there for him to do healing.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And, look! men carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking a way to bring him in and place him before him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So, not finding a way to bring him in on account of the crowd, they climbed up to the roof, and through the tiling they let him down with the little bed among those in front of Jesus.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And when he saw their faith he said: “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Thereupon the scribes and the Pharisees started to reason, saying: “Who is this that is speaking blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But Jesus, discerning their reasonings, said in answer to them: “What are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> reasoning out in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know that the Son of man has authority on the earth to forgive sins—” he said to the paralyzed man: “I say to you, Get up and pick up your little bed and be on your way home.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And instantly he rose up before them, picked up what he used to lie on and went off to his home, glorifying God.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then an ecstasy seized one and all, and they began to glorify God, and they became filled with fear, saying: “We have seen strange things today!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now after these things he went out and beheld a tax collector named Le&acute;vi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And leaving everything behind he rose up and went following him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Also, Le&acute;vi spread a big reception feast for him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were with them reclining at the meal.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">At this the Pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples, saying: “Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In reply Jesus said to them: “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ailing do.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">I have come to call, not righteous persons, but sinners to repentance.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">They said to him: “The disciples of John fast frequently and offer supplications, and so do those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Yet days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Further, he went on to give an illustration to them: “No one cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it onto an old outer garment; but if he does, then both the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Moreover, no one puts new wine into old wineskins; but if he does, then the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">No one that has drunk old wine wants new; for he says, ‘The old is nice.’”</span>

       <span id="vs2">At this some of the Pharisees said: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But Jesus said in reply to them: “Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> never read the very thing David did when he and the men with him got hungry?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">How he entered into the house of God and received the loaves of presentation and ate and gave some to the men with him, which it is lawful for no one to eat but for the priests only?”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs6">In the course of another sabbath he entered into the synagogue and began teaching. And there was a man present whose right hand was withered.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The scribes and the Pharisees were now watching him closely to see whether he would cure on the sabbath, in order to find some way to accuse him.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He, however, knew their reasonings, yet he said to the man with the withered hand: “Get up and stand in the center.” And he rose and took his stand.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Jesus said to them: “I ask <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do injury, to save or to destroy a soul?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And after looking around at them all, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But they became filled with madness, and they began to talk over with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">In the progress of these days he went out into the mountain to pray, and he continued the whole night in prayer to God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But when it became day he called his disciples to him and chose from among them twelve, whom he also named apostles:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bar&middot;thol&acute;o&middot;mew,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and Matthew and Thomas, and James [the son] of Al&middot;phae&acute;us, and Simon who is called “the zealous one,”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and Judas [the son] of James, and Judas Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot, who turned traitor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he came down with them and took his station on a level place, and there was a great crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all of Ju&middot;de&acute;a and Jerusalem and the maritime country of Tyre and Si&acute;don, who came to hear him and be healed of their sicknesses.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Even those troubled with unclean spirits were cured.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And all the crowd were seeking to touch him, because power was going out of him and healing them all.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he lifted up his eyes upon his disciples and began to say:</span>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Happy are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> whenever men hate <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and whenever they exclude <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and reproach <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and cast out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Rejoice in that day and leap, for, look! <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> reward is great in heaven, for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“But woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rich persons, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are having <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> consolation in full.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>

</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs25-2">“Woe, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are laughing now, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will mourn and weep.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Woe, whenever all men speak well of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for things like these are what their forefathers did to the false prophets.</span>

       <span id="vs28">to bless those cursing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, to pray for those who are insulting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">To him that strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also; and from him that takes away your outer garment, do not withhold even the undergarment.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Give to everyone asking you, and from the one taking your things away do not ask [them] back.</span>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Also, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want men to do to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, do the same way to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“And if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> love those loving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, of what credit is it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? For even the sinners love those loving them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do good to those doing good to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, really of what credit is it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Even the sinners do the same.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Also, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> lend [without interest] to those from whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hope to receive, of what credit is it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Even sinners lend [without interest] to sinners that they may get back as much.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">To the contrary, continue to love <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies and to do good and to lend [without interest], not hoping for anything back; and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> reward will be great, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Continue becoming merciful, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father is merciful.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“Moreover, stop judging, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means be judged; and stop condemning, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means be condemned. Keep on releasing, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be released.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Practice giving, and people will give to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. They will pour into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing. For with the measure that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are measuring out, they will measure out to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in return.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Then he also spoke an illustration to them: “A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Both will tumble into a pit, will they not?</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">A pupil is not above his teacher, but everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Why, then, do you look at the straw that is in your brother’s eye, but do not observe the rafter that is in your own eye?</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, allow me to extract the straw that is in your eye,’ while you yourself are not looking at the rafter in that eye of yours? Hypocrite! First extract the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw that is in your brother’s eye.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“For there is not a fine tree producing rotten fruit; again there is not a rotten tree producing fine fruit.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">For each tree is known by its own fruit. For example, people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">A good man brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart, but a wicked man brings forth what is wicked out of his wicked [treasure]; for out of the heart’s abundance his mouth speaks.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">“Why, then, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> call me ‘Lord! Lord!’ but do not do the things I say?</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Everyone that comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> whom he is like:</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">He is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock-mass. Consequently, when a flood arose, the river dashed against that house, but was not strong enough to shake it, because of its being well built.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">On the other hand, he who hears and does not do, is like a man who built a house upon the ground without a foundation. Against it the river dashed, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house became great.”</span>

       <span id="vs4">Then those that came up to Jesus began to entreat him earnestly, saying: “He is worthy of your conferring this upon him,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">for he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Jesus started off with them. But when he was not far from the house, the army officer had already sent friends to say to him: “Sir, do not bother, for I am not fit to have you come in under my roof.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For that reason I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Be on your way!’ and he is on his way, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Well, when Jesus heard these things he marveled at him, and he turned to the crowd following him and said: “I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Not even in Israel have I found so great a faith.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And those that had been sent, on getting back to the house, found the slave in good health.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Closely following this he traveled to a city called Na&acute;in, and his disciples and a great crowd were traveling with him.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As he got near the gate of the city, why, look! there was a dead man being carried out, the only-begotten son of his mother. Besides, she was a widow. A considerable crowd from the city was also with her.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And when the Lord caught sight of her, he was moved with pity for her, and he said to her: “Stop weeping.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">With that he approached and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still, and he said: “Young man, I say to you, Get up!”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the dead man sat up and started to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying: “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and, “God has turned his attention to his people.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And this news concerning him spread out into all Ju&middot;de&acute;a and all the surrounding country.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now John’s disciples reported to him about all these things.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So John summoned a certain two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to say: “Are you the Coming One or are we to expect a different one?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">When they came up to him the men said: “John the Baptist dispatched us to you to say, ‘Are you the Coming One or are we to expect another?’”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In that hour he cured many of sicknesses and grievous diseases and wicked spirits, and granted many blind persons the favor of seeing.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Hence in answer he said to the [two]: “Go <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way, report to John what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> saw and heard: the blind are receiving sight, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, the poor are being told the good news.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And happy is he who has not stumbled over me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">When the messengers of John had gone away, he started to say to the crowds concerning John: “What did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed being tossed by the wind?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">What, then, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out to see? A man dressed in soft outer garments? Why, those in splendid dress and existing in luxury are in royal houses.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Really, then, what did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and far more than a prophet.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Look! I am sending forth my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way ahead of you.’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Among those born of women there is none greater than John; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">(And all the people and the tax collectors, when they heard [this], declared God to be righteous, they having been baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But the Pharisees and those versed in the Law disregarded the counsel of God to them, they not having been baptized by him.)</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“With whom, therefore, shall I compare the men of this generation, and whom are they like?</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">They are like young children sitting in a marketplace and crying out to one another, and who say, ‘We played the flute for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not dance; we wailed, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not weep.’</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Correspondingly, John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘He has a demon.’</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">The Son of man has come eating and drinking, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘Look! A man gluttonous and given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by all its children.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Now a certain one of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. Accordingly he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And, look! a woman who was known in the city to be a sinner learned that he was reclining at a meal in the house of the Pharisee, and she brought an alabaster case of perfumed oil,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and, taking a position behind at his feet, she wept and started to wet his feet with her tears and she would wipe them off with the hair of her head. Also, she tenderly kissed his feet and greased them with the perfumed oil.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">At the sight the Pharisee that invited him said within himself: “This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what kind of woman it is that is touching him, that she is a sinner.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But in reply Jesus said to him: “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He said: “Teacher, say it!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“Two men were debtors to a certain lender; the one was in debt for five hundred de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i, but the other for fifty.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">When they did not have anything with which to pay back, he freely forgave them both. Therefore, which of them will love him the more?”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">In answer Simon said: “I suppose it is the one to whom he freely forgave the more.” He said to him: “You judged correctly.”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">With that he turned to the woman and said to Simon: “Do you behold this woman? I entered into your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But this woman wet my feet with her tears and wiped them off with her hair.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">You gave me no kiss; but this woman, from the hour that I came in, did not leave off tenderly kissing my feet.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">You did not grease my head with oil; but this woman greased my feet with perfumed oil.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">By virtue of this, I tell you, her sins, many though they are, are forgiven, because she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Then he said to her: “Your sins are forgiven.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">At this those reclining at the table with him started to say within themselves: “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">But he said to the woman: “Your faith has saved you; go your way in peace.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Shortly afterwards he went journeying from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and certain women that had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses, Mary the so-called Mag&acute;da&middot;lene, from whom seven demons had come out,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and Jo&middot;an&acute;na the wife of Chu&acute;za, Herod’s man in charge, and Su&middot;san&acute;na and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now when a great crowd had collected together with those that went to him from city after city, he spoke by means of an illustration:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“A sower went out to sow his seed. Well, as he was sowing, some of it fell alongside the road and was trampled down, and the birds of heaven ate it up.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Some other landed upon the rock-mass, and, after sprouting, it dried up because of not having moisture.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Some other fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with it choked it off.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Some other fell upon the good soil, and, after sprouting, it produced fruit a hundredfold.” As he told these things, he proceeded to call out: “Let him that has ears to listen, listen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But his disciples began to ask him what this illustration might mean.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">He said: “To <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations, in order that, though looking, they may look in vain and, though hearing, they may not get the meaning.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Those alongside the road are the ones that have heard, then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts in order that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Those upon the rock-mass are the ones who, when they hear it, receive the word with joy, but these have no root; they believe for a season, but in a season of testing they fall away.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones that have heard, but, by being carried away by anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to perfection.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones that, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand, that those stepping in may behold the light.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, neither anything carefully concealed that will never become known and never come into the open.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Therefore, pay attention to how <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> listen; for whoever has, more will be given him, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now his mother and brothers came toward him, but they were unable to get to him because of the crowd.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">However, it was reported to him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In reply he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">In the course of one of the days he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But as they were sailing he fell asleep. Now a violent windstorm descended upon the lake, and they began to fill up with [water] and to be in danger.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Finally they went to him and roused him, saying: “Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!” Rousing himself, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then he said to them: “Where is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith?” But struck with fear, they marveled, saying to one another: “Who really is this, for he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they put in to shore in the country of the Ger&acute;a&middot;senes, which is on the side opposite Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But as he got out onto land a certain man from the city who had demons met him. And for a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not at home, but among the tombs.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">At the sight of Jesus he cried aloud and fell down before him, and with a loud voice he said: “What have I to do with you, Jesus Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">(For he had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For over a long time it had held him fast, and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters under guard, but he would burst the bonds and be driven by the demon into the lonely places.)</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said: “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And they kept entreating him not to order them to go away into the abyss.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Now a herd of a considerable number of swine was feeding there on the mountain; so they entreated him to permit them to enter into those. And he gave them permission.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then the demons went out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it to the city and to the countryside.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Then people turned out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons came out, clothed and in his sound mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus; and they became fearful.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">So all the multitude from the surrounding country of the Ger&acute;a&middot;senes asked him to get away from them, because they were in the grip of great fear. Then he went aboard the boat and turned away.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him; but he dismissed the man, saying:</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">“Be on your way back home, and keep on relating what things God did for you.” Accordingly he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what things Jesus did for him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">When Jesus got back, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">But, look! a man named Ja&acute;i&middot;rus came, and this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to entreat him to enter into his house,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">because he had an only-begotten daughter about twelve years old and she was dying.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs42-2">As he was going the crowds thronged him.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And a woman, subject to a flow of blood for twelve years, who had not been able to get a cure from anyone,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and instantly her flow of blood stopped.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">So Jesus said: “Who was it that touched me?” When they were all denying it, Peter said: “Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and closely pressing you.”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Yet Jesus said: “Someone touched me, for I perceived that power went out of me.”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and disclosed before all the people the cause for which she touched him and how she was healed instantly.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">But he said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go your way in peace.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">While he was yet speaking, a certain representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: “Your daughter has died; do not bother the teacher any longer.”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">On hearing this, Jesus answered him: “Have no fear, only put forth faith, and she will be saved.”</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">When he reached the house he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter and John and James and the girl’s father and mother.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: “S<span class="smallcaps">TOP</span> weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">But he took her by the hand and called, saying: “Girl, get up!”</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">And her spirit returned, and she rose instantly, and he ordered something to be given her to eat.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">Well, her parents were beside themselves; but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.</span>

<p class="title">Luke 9:1-62</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="62">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure sicknesses.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And so he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God and to heal,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch, nor bread nor silver money; neither have two undergarments.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But wherever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> enter into a home, stay there and leave from there.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And wherever people do not receive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, on going out of that city shake the dust off <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet for a witness against them.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then starting out they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now Herod the district ruler heard of all the things happening, and he was in great perplexity because of its being said by some that John had been raised up from the dead,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">but by others that E&middot;li&acute;jah had appeared, but by still others that a certain one of the ancient prophets had risen.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Herod said: “John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” So he was seeking to see him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And when the apostles returned they recounted to him what things they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew to privacy into a city called Beth&middot;sa&acute;i&middot;da.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the day started to decline. The twelve now came up and said to him: “Dismiss the crowd, that they may go into the villages and countryside round about and procure lodging and find provisions, because out here we are in a lonely place.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But he said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fishes, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy foodstuffs for all these people.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">They were, in fact, about five thousand men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them recline as at meals, in groups of about fifty each.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And they did so and had them all recline.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, blessed them and broke them up and began to give them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So they all ate and were satisfied, and the surplus that they had was taken up, twelve baskets of fragments.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came together to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In reply they said: “John the Baptist; but others, E&middot;li&acute;jah, and still others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, though, who do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say I am?” Peter said in reply: “The Christ of God.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then in a stern talk to them he instructed them not to be telling this to anybody,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">but said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake is the one that will save it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Really, what does a man benefit himself if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers damage?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of this one when he arrives in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> truthfully, There are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In actual fact, about eight days after these words, he took Peter and John and James along and climbed up into the mountain to pray.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And as he was praying the appearance of his face became different and his apparel became glitteringly white.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Also, look! two men were conversing with him, who were Moses and E&middot;li&acute;jah.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure that he was destined to fulfill at Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep; but when they got fully awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And as these were being separated from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Instructor, it is fine for us to be here, so let us erect three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for E&middot;li&acute;jah,” he not realizing what he was saying.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But as he was saying these things a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became fearful.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the one that has been chosen. Listen to him.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And as the voice occurred Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">On the succeeding day, when they got down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And, look! a man cried out from the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only-begotten,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">and, look! a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foam, and it scarcely withdraws from him after bruising him.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">In response Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and put up with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Lead your son over here.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">But even as he was approaching, the demon dashed him to the ground and violently convulsed him. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and delivered him to his father.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Well, they all began to be astounded at the majestic power of God.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs43-2">Now as they were all marveling at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples:</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“Give lodgment to these words in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ears, for the Son of man is destined to be delivered into the hands of men.”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">But they continued without understanding of this saying. In fact, it was concealed from them that they might not see through it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Then a reasoning entered among them as to who would be the greatest of them.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, set it beside him</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">and said to them: “Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me [too], and whoever receives me receives him [also] that sent me forth. For he that conducts himself as a lesser one among all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is the one that is great.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">In response John said: “Instructor, we saw a certain man expelling demons by the use of your name and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">But Jesus said to him: “Do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men try to prevent [him], for he that is not against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">As the days were now coming to the full for him to be taken up, he firmly set his face to go to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">So he sent forth messengers in advance of him. And they went their way and entered into a village of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tans, to make preparation for him;</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">but they did not receive him, because his face was set for going to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">When the disciples James and John saw this they said: “Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and annihilate them?”</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">But he turned and rebuked them.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">So they went to a different village.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Now as they were going on the road, someone said to him: “I will follow you to wherever you may depart.”</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">And Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">Then he said to another: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Permit me first to leave and bury my father.”</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">But he said to him: “Let the dead bury their dead, but you go away and declare abroad the kingdom of God.”</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">And still another said: “I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those in my household.”</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">Jesus said to him: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">After these things the Lord designated seventy others and sent them forth by twos in advance of him into every city and place to which he himself was going to come.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he began to say to them: “The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Go forth. Look! I am sending <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forth as lambs in among wolves.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Do not carry a purse, nor a food pouch, nor sandals, and do not embrace anybody in greeting along the road.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Wherever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> enter into a house say first, ‘May this house have peace.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And if a friend of peace is there, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will turn back to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So stay in that house, eating and drinking the things they provide, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not be transferring from house to house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Also, wherever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> enter into a city and they receive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, eat the things set before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and cure the sick ones in it, and go on telling them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But wherever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> enter into a city and they do not receive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, go out into its broad ways and say,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">‘Even the dust that got stuck to our feet from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> city we wipe off against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Nevertheless, keep this in mind, that the kingdom of God has come near.’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that it will be more endurable for Sod&acute;om in that day than for that city.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Woe to you, Cho&middot;ra&acute;zin! Woe to you, Beth&middot;sa&acute;i&middot;da! because if the powerful works that have taken place in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had taken place in Tyre and Si&acute;don, they would long ago have repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Consequently it will be more endurable for Tyre and Si&acute;don in the judgment than for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And you, Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to Ha&acute;des you will come!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“He that listens to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> listens to me [too]. And he that disregards <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> disregards me [too]. Moreover, he that disregards me disregards [also] him that sent me forth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the seventy returned with joy, saying: “Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that he said to them: “I began to behold Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Look! I have given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will by any means do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hurt.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Nevertheless, do not rejoice over this, that the spirits are made subject to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but rejoice because <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> names have been inscribed in the heavens.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, O Father, because to do thus came to be the way approved by you.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and who the Son is no one knows but the Father; and who the Father is, no one [knows] but the Son, and he to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">With that he turned to the disciples by themselves and said: “Happy are the eyes that behold the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are beholding.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Many prophets and kings desired to see the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are beholding but did not see them, and to hear the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are hearing but did not hear them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now, look! a certain man versed in the Law rose up, to test him out, and said: “Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">In answer he said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind,’ and, ‘your neighbor as yourself.’”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">He said to him: “You answered correctly; ‘keep on doing this and you will get life.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But, wanting to prove himself righteous, the man said to Jesus: “Who really is my neighbor?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In reply Jesus said: “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and fell among robbers, who both stripped him and inflicted blows, and went off, leaving him half-dead.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Now, by coincidence, a certain priest was going down over that road, but, when he saw him, he went by on the opposite side.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Likewise, a Levite also, when he got down to the place and saw him, went by on the opposite side.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But a certain Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tan traveling the road came upon him and, at seeing him, he was moved with pity.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">So he approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine upon them. Then he mounted him upon his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And the next day he took out two de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, ‘Take care of him, and whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I come back here.’</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man that fell among the robbers?”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">He said: “The one that acted mercifully toward him.” Jesus then said to him: “Go your way and be doing the same yourself.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Now as they were going their way he entered into a certain village. Here a certain woman named Martha received him as guest into the house.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">This woman also had a sister called Mary, who, however, sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to his word.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties. So, she came near and said: “Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things? Tell her, therefore, to join in helping me.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">A few things, though, are needed, or just one. For her part, Mary chose the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="54">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now on the occasion of his being in a certain place praying, when he stopped, a certain one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he said to them: “Whenever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> pray, say, ‘Father, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Give us our bread for the day according to the day’s requirement.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone that is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Further, he said to them: “Who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, loan me three loaves,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">because a friend of mine has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to set before him’?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And that one from inside says in reply, ‘Quit making me trouble. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything.’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Although he will not rise up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him what things he needs.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Accordingly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Keep on asking, and it will be given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; keep on seeking, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking it will be opened.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Indeed, which father is there among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who, if his son asks for a fish, will perhaps hand him a serpent instead of a fish?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Later he was expelling a dumb demon. After the demon came out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But certain ones of them said: “He expels the demons by means of Be&middot;el&acute;ze&middot;bub the ruler of the demons.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, others, to tempt him, began seeking a sign out of heaven from him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Knowing their imaginations he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and a house [divided] against itself falls.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say I expel the demons by means of Be&middot;el&acute;ze&middot;bub.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">If it is by means of Be&middot;el&acute;ze&middot;bub I expel the demons, by whom do <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons expel them? Because of this they will be judges of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But if it is by means of God’s finger I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When a strong man, well armed, guards his palace, his belongings continue in peace.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him, he takes away his full armament in which he was trusting, and he divides out the things he despoiled him of.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through parched places in search of a resting-place, and, after finding none, it says, ‘I will return to my house out of which I moved.’</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And on arriving it finds it swept clean and adorned.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then it goes its way and takes along seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and, after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now as he was saying these things a certain woman out of the crowd raised her voice and said to him: “Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that you sucked!”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But he said: “No, rather, Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">When the crowds were massing together, he started to say: “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign. But no sign will be given it except the sign of Jo&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">For just as Jo&acute;nah became a sign to the Nin&acute;e&middot;vites, in the same way will the Son of man be also to this generation.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, but, look! something more than Sol&acute;o&middot;mon is here.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">The men of Nin&acute;e&middot;veh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repented at what Jo&acute;nah preached; but, look! something more than Jo&acute;nah is here.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">After lighting a lamp, a person puts it, not in a vault nor under a measuring basket, but upon the lampstand, that those stepping in may behold the light.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is simple, your whole body is also bright; but when it is wicked, your body is also dark.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Be alert, therefore. Perhaps the light that is in you is darkness.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Therefore, if your whole body is bright with no part at all dark, it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">When he had spoken this, a Pharisee requested him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">However, the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">But the Lord said to him: “Now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> Pharisees, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but the inside of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is full of plunder and wickedness.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Unreasonable persons! He that made the outside made also the inside, did he not?</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Nevertheless, give as gifts of mercy the things that are inside, and, look! all [other] things are clean about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">But woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> Pharisees, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> give the tenth of the mint and the rue and of every [other] vegetable, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> pass by the justice and the love of God! These things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were under obligation to do, but those other things not to omit.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> Pharisees, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces!</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are as those memorial tombs which are not in evidence, so that men walk upon them and do not know [it]!”</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs45">In answer a certain one of those versed in the Law said to him: “Teacher, in saying these things you also insult us.”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Then he said: “Woe also to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are versed in the Law, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> load men with loads hard to be borne, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves do not touch the loads with one of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fingers!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">“Woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> build the memorial tombs of the prophets, but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers killed them!</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Certainly <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are witnesses of the deeds of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> give consent to them, because these killed the prophets but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are building [their tombs].</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">On this account the wisdom of God also said, ‘I will send forth to them prophets and apostles, and they will kill and persecute some of them,</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be required from this generation,</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah, who was slain between the altar and the house.’ Yes, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, it will be required from this generation.</span>

<p><a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">“Woe to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are versed in the Law, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> took away the key of knowledge; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves did not go in, and those going in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hindered!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">So when he went out from there the scribes and the Pharisees started in to press upon him terribly and to ply him with questions about further things,</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the meantime, when the crowd had gathered together in so many thousands that they were stepping upon one another, he started out by saying first to his disciples: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed, and secret that will not become known.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Wherefore what things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Moreover, I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, my friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But I will indicate to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> whom to fear: Fear him who after killing has authority to throw into Ge&middot;hen&acute;na. Yes, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, fear this One.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them goes forgotten before God.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But even the hairs of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads are all numbered. Have no fear; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are worth more than many sparrows.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“I say, then, to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Everyone that confesses union with me before men, the Son of man will also confess union with him before the angels of God.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But he that disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And everyone that says a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but he that blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven it.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But when they bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in before public assemblies and government officials and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will speak in defense or what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">for the holy spirit will teach <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in that very hour the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ought to say.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then a certain one of the crowd said to him: “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">He said to him: “Man, who appointed me judge or apportioner over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> persons?”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then he said to them: “Keep <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">With that he spoke an illustration to them, saying: “The land of a certain rich man produced well.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Consequently he began reasoning within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my good things;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and I will say to my soul: “Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then he said to his disciples: “On this account I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Quit being anxious about <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls as to what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat or about <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bodies as to what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will wear.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For the soul is worth more than food and the body than clothing.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> than birds?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">If, therefore, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot do the least thing, why be anxious about the remaining things?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Mark well how the lilies grow; they neither toil nor spin; but I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Not even Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much rather will he clothe <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with little faith!</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">So quit seeking what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might eat and what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might drink, and quit being in anxious suspense;</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father knows <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> need these things.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Nevertheless, seek continually his kingdom, and these things will be added to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“Have no fear, little flock, because <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father has approved of giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the kingdom.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Sell the things belonging to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and give gifts of mercy. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where a thief does not get near nor moth consumes.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For where <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> treasure is, there <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts will be also.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“Let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> loins be girded and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> lamps be burning,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves be like men waiting for their master when he returns from the marriage, so that at his arriving and knocking they may at once open to him.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Happy are those slaves whom the master on arriving finds watching! Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He will gird himself and make them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And if he arrives in the second watch, even if in the third, and finds them thus, happy are they!</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">But know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have kept watching and not have let his house be broken into.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> also, keep ready, because at an hour that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not think likely the Son of man is coming.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Then Peter said: “Lord, are you saying this illustration to us or also to all?”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And the Lord said: “Who really is the faithful steward, the discreet one, whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time?</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Happy is that slave, if his master on arriving finds him doing so!</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> truthfully, He will appoint him over all his belongings.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">But if ever that slave should say in his heart, ‘My master delays coming,’ and should start to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting [him] and in an hour that he does not know, and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Then that slave that understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do in line with his will will be beaten with many strokes.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">But the one that did not understand and so did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few. Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him; and the one whom people put in charge of much, they will demand more than usual of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">“I came to start a fire on the earth, and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lighted?</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Indeed, I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how I am being distressed until it is finished!</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> imagine I came to give peace on the earth? No, indeed, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but rather division.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against [her] mother, mother-in-law against [her] daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against [her] mother-in-law.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Then he went on to say also to the crowds: “When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see a cloud rising in western parts, at once <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and it turns out so.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">And when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see that a south wind is blowing, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">Hypocrites, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know how to examine the outward appearance of earth and sky, but how is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know how to examine this particular time?</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not judge also for yourselves what is righteous?</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">For example, when you are going with your adversary at law to a ruler, get to work, while on the way, to rid yourself of the dispute with him, that he may never hale you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison.</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">I tell you, You will certainly not get out from there until you pay over the last small coin of very little value.”</span>

<p class="title">Luke 13:1-35</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="35">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At that very season there were certain ones present that reported to him about the Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;ans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So in reply he said to them: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> imagine that these Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;ans were proved worse sinners than all other Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;ans because they have suffered these things?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">No, indeed, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; but, unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> repent, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will all likewise be destroyed.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Si&middot;lo&acute;am fell, thereby killing them, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> imagine that they were proved greater debtors than all other men inhabiting Jerusalem?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">No, indeed, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; but, unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> repent, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will all be destroyed in the same way.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then he went on to tell this illustration: “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it, but found none.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then he said to the vinedresser, ‘Here it is three years that I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, but have found none. Cut it down! Why really should it keep the ground useless?’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In reply he said to him, ‘Master, let it alone also this year, until I dig around it and put on manure;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and if then it produces fruit in the future, [well and good]; but if not, you shall cut it down.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And, look! a woman with a spirit of weakness for eighteen years, and she was bent double and was unable to raise herself up at all.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When he saw her, Jesus addressed her and said to her: “Woman, you are released from your weakness.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he laid his hands on her; and instantly she straightened up, and began to glorify God.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But in response the presiding officer of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus did the cure on the sabbath, began to say to the crowd: “There are six days on which work ought to be done; on them, therefore, come and be cured, and not on the sabbath day.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, the Lord answered him and said: “Hypocrites, does not each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on the sabbath untie his bull or his ass from the stall and lead it away to give it drink?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Was it not due, then, for this woman who is a daughter of Abraham, and whom Satan held bound, look! eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Well, when he said these things, all his opposers began to feel shame; but all the crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things done by him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Therefore he went on to say: “What is the kingdom of God like, and with what shall I compare it?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">It is like a mustard grain that a man took and put in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of heaven took up lodging in its branches.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And again he said: “With what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And he journeyed through from city to city and from village to village, teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now a certain man said to him: “Lord, are those who are being saved few?” He said to them:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door, because many, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, will seek to get in but will not be able,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">when once the householder has got up and locked the door, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> start to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Sir, open to us.’ But in answer he will say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘I do not know where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are from.’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will start saying, ‘We ate and drank in front of you, and you taught in our broad ways.’</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But he will speak and say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘I do not know where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are from. Get away from me, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> workers of unrighteousness!’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">There is where [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] weeping and the gnashing of [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] teeth will be, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves thrown outside.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Furthermore, people will come from eastern parts and western, and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And, look! there are those last who will be first, and there are those first who will be last.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In that very hour certain Pharisees came up, saying to him: “Get out and be on your way from here, because Herod wants to kill you.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And he said to them: “Go and tell that fox, ‘Look! I am casting out demons and accomplishing healing today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be finished.’</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the following day, because it is not admissible for a prophet to be destroyed outside of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her—how often I wanted to gather your children together in the manner that a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people did not want [it]!</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Look! Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> house is abandoned to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will by no means see me until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name.’”</span>

<p class="title">Luke 14:1-35</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="35">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And on an occasion when he went into the house of a certain one of the rulers of the Pharisees on the sabbath to eat a meal, they were closely watching him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, look! there was before him a certain man who had dropsy.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So in response Jesus spoke to those versed in the Law and to the Pharisees, saying: “Is it lawful on the sabbath to cure or not?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But they kept silent. With that he took hold of [the man], healed him and sent [him] away.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he said to them: “Who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, if his son or bull falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And they were not able to answer back on these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He then went on to tell the invited men an illustration, as he marked how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves, saying to them:</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“When you are invited by someone to a marriage feast, do not lie down in the most prominent place. Perhaps someone more distinguished than you may at the time have been invited by him,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and he that invited you and him will come and say to you, ‘Let this man have the place.’ And then you will start off with shame to occupy the lowest place.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, that when the man that has invited you comes he will say to you, ‘Friend, go on up higher.’ Then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For everyone that exalts himself will be humbled and he that humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Next he proceeded to say also to the man that invited him: “When you spread a dinner or evening meal, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors. Perhaps sometime they might also invite you in return and it would become a repayment to you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But when you spread a feast, invite poor people, crippled, lame, blind;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">On hearing these things a certain one of the fellow guests said to him: “Happy is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">[Jesus] said to him: “A certain man was spreading a grand evening meal, and he invited many.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones, ‘Come, because things are now ready.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But they all in common started to beg off. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field and need to go out and see it; I ask you, Have me excused.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And another said, ‘I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, Have me excused.’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Still another said, ‘I just married a wife and for this reason I cannot come.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the slave came up and reported these things to his master. Then the householder became wrathful and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly into the broad ways and the lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">In time the slave said, ‘Master, what you ordered has been done, and yet there is room.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the roads and the fenced-in places, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, None of those men that were invited shall have a taste of my evening meal.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now great crowds were traveling with him, and he turned and said to them:</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own soul, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Whoever is not carrying his torture stake and coming after me cannot be my disciple.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">For example, who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense, to see if he has enough to complete it?</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Otherwise, he might lay its foundation but not be able to finish it, and all the onlookers might start to ridicule him,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">saying, ‘This man started to build but was not able to finish.’</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Or what king, marching to meet another king in war, does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand troops to cope with the one that comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Thus, you may be sure, none of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that does not say good-bye to all his belongings can be my disciple.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if even the salt loses its strength, with what will it be seasoned?</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">It is suitable neither for soil nor for manure. People throw it outside. Let him that has ears to listen, listen.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now all the tax collectors and the sinners kept drawing near to him to hear him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Consequently both the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering, saying: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then he spoke this illustration to them, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“What man of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with a hundred sheep, on losing one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine behind in the wilderness and go for the lost one until he finds it?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And when he has found it he puts it upon his shoulders and rejoices.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And when he gets home he calls his friends and his neighbors together, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that thus there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninety-nine righteous ones who have no need of repentance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Or what woman with ten drachma coins, if she loses one drachma coin, does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And when she has found it she calls the women who are her friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found the drachma coin that I lost.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Thus, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, joy arises among the angels of God over one sinner that repents.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then he said: “A certain man had two sons.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the part of the property that falls to my share.’ Then he divided his means of living to them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Later, after not many days, the younger son gathered all things together and traveled abroad into a distant country, and there squandered his property by living a debauched life.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">When he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he started to be in need.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to herd swine.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he used to desire to be filled with the carob pods which the swine were eating, and no one would give him [anything].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many hired men of my father are abounding with bread, while I am perishing here from famine!</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I will rise and journey to my father and say to him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.”’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So he rose and went to his father. While he was yet a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and fell upon his neck and tenderly kissed him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe him with it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And bring the fattened young bull, slaughter it and let us eat and enjoy ourselves,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">because this my son was dead and came to life again; he was lost and was found.’ And they started to enjoy themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Now his older son was in the field; and as he came and got near the house he heard a music concert and dancing.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So he called one of the servants to him and inquired what these things meant.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father slaughtered the fattened young bull, because he got him back in good health.’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But he became wrathful and was unwilling to go in. Then his father came out and began to entreat him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In reply he said to his father, ‘Here it is so many years I have slaved for you and never once did I transgress your commandment, and yet to me you never once gave a kid for me to enjoy myself with my friends.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But as soon as this your son who ate up your means of living with harlots arrived, you slaughtered the fattened young bull for him.’</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then he said to him, ‘Child, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours;</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">but we just had to enjoy ourselves and rejoice, because this your brother was dead and came to life, and he was lost and was found.’”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then he went on to say also to the disciples: “A certain man was rich and he had a steward, and this one was accused to him as handling his goods wastefully.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Hand in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer manage the house.’</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then the steward said to himself, ‘What am I to do, seeing that my master will take the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, I am ashamed to beg.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Ah! I know what I shall do, so that, when I am put out of the stewardship, people will receive me into their homes.’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And calling to him each one of the debtors of his master he proceeded to say to the first, ‘How much are you owing my master?’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">He said, ‘A hundred bath measures of olive oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your written agreement back and sit down and quickly write fifty.’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Next, he said to another one, ‘Now you, how much are you owing?’ He said, ‘A hundred cor measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your written agreement back and write eighty.’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And his master commended the steward, though unrighteous, because he acted with practical wisdom; for the sons of this system of things are wiser in a practical way toward their own generation than the sons of the light are.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Also, I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that, when such fail, they may receive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into the everlasting dwelling places.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Therefore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches, who will entrust <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with what is true?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what is another’s, who will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> what is for yourselves?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">No house servant can be a slave to two masters; for, either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> cannot be slaves to God and to riches.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now the Pharisees, who were money lovers, were listening to all these things, and they began to sneer at him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Consequently he said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are those who declare yourselves righteous before men, but God knows <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts; because what is lofty among men is a disgusting thing in God’s sight.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“The Law and the Prophets were until John. From then on the kingdom of God is being declared as good news, and every sort of person is pressing forward toward it.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Indeed, it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one particle of a letter of the Law to go unfulfilled.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Everyone that divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he that marries a woman divorced from a husband commits adultery.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“But a certain man was rich, and he used to deck himself with purple and linen, enjoying himself from day to day with magnificence.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But a certain beggar named Laz&acute;a&middot;rus used to be put at his gate, full of ulcers</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man. Yes, too, the dogs would come and lick his ulcers.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Now in course of time the beggar died and he was carried off by the angels to the bosom [position] of Abraham.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs22-2">“Also, the rich man died and was buried.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And in Ha&acute;des he lifted up his eyes, he existing in torments, and he saw Abraham afar off and Laz&acute;a&middot;rus in the bosom [position] with him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So he called and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Laz&acute;a&middot;rus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this blazing fire.’</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you received in full your good things in your lifetime, but Laz&acute;a&middot;rus correspondingly the injurious things. Now, however, he is having comfort here but you are in anguish.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And besides all these things, a great chasm has been fixed between us and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, so that those wanting to go over from here to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people cannot, neither may people cross over from there to us.’</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then he said, ‘In that event I ask you, father, to send him to the house of my father,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">for I have five brothers, in order that he may give them a thorough witness, that they also should not get into this place of torment.’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to these.’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then he said, ‘No, indeed, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent.’</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.’”</span>

       <span id="vs8">Rather, will he not say to him, ‘Get something ready for me to have my evening meal, and put on an apron and minister to me until I am through eating and drinking, and afterward you can eat and drink’?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did the things assigned, will he?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, also, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have done all the things assigned to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, say, ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And while he was going to Jerusalem he was passing through the midst of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And as he was entering into a certain village ten leprous men met him, but they stood up afar off.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And they raised their voices and said: “Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And when he got sight of them he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then as they were going off their cleansing occurred.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">One of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he fell upon his face at [Jesus’] feet, thanking him; furthermore, he was a Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tan.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In reply Jesus said: “The ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Were none found that turned back to give glory to God but this man of another nation?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he said to him: “Rise and be on your way; your faith has made you well.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them and said: “The kingdom of God is not coming with striking observableness,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">neither will people be saying, ‘See here!’ or, ‘There!’ For, look! the kingdom of God is in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then he said to the disciples: “Days will come when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not see [it].</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And people will say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘See there!’ or, ‘See here!’ Do not go out or chase after [them].</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For even as the lightning, by its flashing, shines from one part under heaven to another part under heaven, so the Son of man will be.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">First, however, he must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by this generation.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Moreover, just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of man:</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">they were eating, they were drinking, men were marrying, women were being given in marriage, until that day when Noah entered into the ark, and the flood arrived and destroyed them all.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But on the day that Lot came out of Sod&acute;om it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“On that day let the person that is on the housetop but whose movable things are in the house not come down to pick these up, and the person out in the field, let him likewise not return to the things behind.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">R<span class="smallcaps">EMEMBER</span> the wife of Lot.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Whoever seeks to keep his soul safe for himself will lose it, but whoever loses it will preserve it alive.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, In that night two [men] will be in one bed; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">There will be two [women] grinding at the same mill; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">——</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">So in response they said to him: “Where, Lord?” He said to them: “Where the body is, there also the eagles will be gathered together.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then he went on to tell them an illustration with regard to the need for them always to pray and not to give up,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">saying: “In a certain city there was a certain judge that had no fear of God and had no respect for man.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But there was a widow in that city and she kept going to him, saying, ‘See that I get justice from my adversary at law.’</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Well, for a while he was unwilling, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Although I do not fear God or respect a man,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">at any rate, because of this widow’s continually making me trouble, I will see that she gets justice, so that she will not keep coming and pummeling me to a finish.’”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then the Lord said: “H<span class="smallcaps">EAR</span> what the judge, although unrighteous, said!</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Certainly, then, shall not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, even though he is long-suffering toward them?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He will cause justice to be done to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man arrives, will he really find the faith on the earth?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But he spoke this illustration also to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and who considered the rest as nothing:</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, ‘O God, I thank you I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I fast twice a week, I give the tenth of all things I acquire.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his breast, saying, ‘O God, be gracious to me a sinner.’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, This man went down to his home proved more righteous than that man; because everyone that exalts himself will be humiliated, but he that humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now people began to bring him also their infants for him to touch these; but on seeing it the disciples began to reprimand them.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, Jesus called the [infants] to him, saying: “Let the young children come to me, and do not try to stop them. For the kingdom of God belongs to suchlike ones.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a young child will by no means get into it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And a certain ruler questioned him, saying: “Good Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">You know the commandments, ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then he said: “All these I have kept from youth on.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">After hearing that, Jesus said to him: “There is yet one thing lacking about you: Sell all the things you have and distribute to poor people, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come be my follower.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">When he heard this, he became deeply grieved, for he was very rich.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Jesus looked at him and said: “How difficult a thing it will be for those having money to make their way into the kingdom of God!</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Those who heard this said: “Who possibly can be saved?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He said: “The things impossible with men are possible with God.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But Peter said: “Look! We have left our own things and followed you.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">He said to them: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, There is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">who will not in any way get many times more in this period of time, and in the coming system of things everlasting life.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then he took the twelve aside and said to them: “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by means of the prophets as to the Son of man will be completed.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For instance, he will be delivered up to [men of] the nations and will be made fun of and be treated insolently and spit upon;</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">and after scourging him they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">However, they did not get the meaning of any of these things; but this utterance was hidden from them, and they were not knowing the things said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Now as he was getting near to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho a certain blind man was sitting beside the road begging.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Because he heard a crowd moving through he began to inquire what this might mean.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">They reported to him: “Jesus the Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute; is passing by!”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">At that he cried out, saying: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And those going in advance began to tell him sternly to keep quiet, but that much more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Then Jesus stood still and commanded the [man] to be led to him. After he got near, [Jesus] asked him:</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“What do you want me to do for you?” He said: “Lord, let me recover sight.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">So Jesus said to him: “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And instantly he recovered sight, and he began to follow him, glorifying God. Also, all the people, at seeing [it], gave praise to God.</span>

       <span id="vs4">So he ran ahead to an advance position and climbed a fig-mulberry tree in order to see him, because he was about to go through that way.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now when Jesus got to the place, he looked up and said to him: “Zac&middot;chae&acute;us, hurry and get down, for today I must stay in your house.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">With that he hurried and got down and with rejoicing he received him as guest.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But when they saw [it], they all fell to muttering, saying: “With a man that is a sinner he went in to lodge.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But Zac&middot;chae&acute;us stood up and said to the Lord: “Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone by false accusation I am restoring fourfold.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this Jesus said to him: “This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">While they were listening to these things he spoke in addition an illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they were imagining that the kingdom of God was going to display itself instantly.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Therefore he said: “A certain man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Calling ten slaves of his he gave them ten mi&acute;nas and told them, ‘Do business till I come.’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him, to say, ‘We do not want this [man] to become king over us.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Eventually when he got back after having secured the kingly power, he commanded to be called to him these slaves to whom he had given the silver money, in order to ascertain what they had gained by business activity.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then the first one presented himself, saying, ‘Lord, your mi&acute;na gained ten mi&acute;nas.’</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now the second came, saying, ‘Your mi&acute;na, Lord, made five mi&acute;nas.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">He said to this one also, ‘You, too, be in charge of five cities.’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But a different one came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mi&acute;na, that I kept laid away in a cloth.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take up what you did not deposit and you reap what you did not sow.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Hence why is it you did not put my silver money in a bank? Then on my arrival I would have collected it with interest.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“With that he said to those standing by, ‘Take the mi&acute;na from him and give it to him that has the ten mi&acute;nas.’</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten mi&acute;nas!’—</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">‘I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, To everyone that has, more will be given; but from the one that does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Moreover, these enemies of mine that did not want me to become king over them <span class="smallcaps">BRING</span> here and slaughter them before me.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So, after he had said these things, he began to go on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And when he got near to Beth&acute;pha&middot;ge and Beth&acute;a&middot;ny at the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent forth two of the disciples,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">saying: “Go into the village that is within sight of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and in it after <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> pass in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will find a colt tied, on which none of mankind ever sat. Loose it and bring it.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But if anyone asks <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are loosing it?’ <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must speak in this way, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">So those who were sent forth departed and found it just as he said to them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But as they were loosing the colt the owners of it said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> loosing the colt?”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">They said: “The Lord needs it.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their outer garments upon the colt and set Jesus upon [it].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">As he moved along they kept spreading their outer garments on the road.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives all the multitude of the disciples started to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice concerning all the powerful works they had seen,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">saying: “Blessed is the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest places!”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But in reply he said: “I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If these remained silent, the stones would cry out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And when he got nearby, he viewed the city and wept over it,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">saying: “If you, even you, had discerned in this day the things having to do with peace—but now they have been hid from your eyes.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification with pointed stakes and will encircle you and distress you from every side,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">and they will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And he entered into the temple and started to throw out those who were selling,</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">saying to them: “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’ but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> made it a cave of robbers.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Furthermore, he went teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to destroy him;</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">and yet they did not find the effective thing for them to do, for the people one and all kept hanging onto him to hear him.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="47">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the older men came near,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and they spoke up, saying to him: “Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">In reply he said to them: “I will also ask <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a question, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> tell me:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then among themselves they drew conclusions, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not believe him?’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people one and all will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So they replied that they did not know its source.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jesus said to them: “Neither am I telling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by what authority I do these things.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then he started to tell the people this illustration: “A man planted a vineyard and let it out to cultivators, and he traveled abroad for considerable time.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But in due season he sent out a slave to the cultivators, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. The cultivators, however, sent him away empty, after beating him up.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But he repeated and sent them a different slave. That one also they beat up and dishonored and sent away empty.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Yet again he sent a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At this the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son the beloved. Likely they will respect this one.’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">When the cultivators caught sight of him they went reasoning with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.’</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">With that they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">He will come and destroy these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs16-2">On hearing [this] they said: “Never may that happen!”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But he looked upon them and said: “What, then, does this that is written mean, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone’?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Everyone falling upon that stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">The scribes and the chief priests now sought to get their hands on him in that very hour, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he spoke this illustration with them in mind.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And, after observing him closely, they sent out men secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous, in order that they might catch him in speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality, but you teach the way of God in line with truth:</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Is it lawful for us to pay tax to Caesar or not?”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But he detected their cunning and said to them:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Show me a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us. Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said: “Caesar’s.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He said to them: “By all means, then, pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Well, they were not able to catch him in this saying before the people, but, in amazement at his answer, they said nothing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">However, some of the Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came up and questioned him,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote us, ‘If a man’s brother dies having a wife, but this one remained childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring from her for his brother.’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Accordingly there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So the second,</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">and the third took her. Likewise even the seven: they did not leave children behind, but died off.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Lastly, the woman also died.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Consequently, in the resurrection, of which one of them does she become [the] wife? For the seven got her as wife.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus said to them: “The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage,</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">In fact, neither can they die anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But that the dead are raised up even Moses disclosed, in the account about the thornbush, when he calls Jehovah ‘the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.’</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">In response some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">For no longer did they have the courage to ask him a single question.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">In turn he said to them: “How is it they say that the Christ is David’s son?</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">David, therefore, calls him ‘Lord’; so how is he his son?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then, while all the people were listening he said to the disciples:</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">“Look out for the scribes who desire to walk around in robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and front seats in the synagogues and most prominent places at evening meals,</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">and who devour the houses of the widows and for a pretext make long prayers. These will receive a heavier judgment.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now as he looked up he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he saw a certain needy widow drop two small coins of very little value there,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and he said: “I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> truthfully, This widow, although poor, dropped in more than they all did.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For all these dropped in gifts out of their surplus, but this [woman] out of her want dropped in all the means of living she had.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later, as certain ones were speaking concerning the temple, how it was adorned with fine stones and dedicated things,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">he said: “As for these things that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are beholding, the days will come in which not a stone upon a stone will be left here and not be thrown down.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, when will these things actually be, and what will be the sign when these things are destined to occur?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He said: “Look out that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not misled; for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The due time has approached.’ Do not go after them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Furthermore, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hear of wars and disorders, do not be terrified. For these things must occur first, but the end does not [occur] immediately.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then he went on to say to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and there will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another pestilences and food shortages; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“But before all these things people will lay their hands upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and persecute <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, delivering <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up to the synagogues and prisons, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">It will turn out to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for a witness.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore settle it in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts not to rehearse beforehand how to make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> defense,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">for I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a mouth and wisdom, which all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Moreover, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to death;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And yet not a hair of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads will by any means perish.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">By endurance on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will acquire <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“Furthermore, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then let those in Ju&middot;de&acute;a begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of her withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her;</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">because these are days for meting out justice, that all the things written may be fulfilled.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Woe to the pregnant women and the ones suckling a baby in those days! For there will be great necessity upon the land and wrath on this people;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Also, there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and [its] agitation,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But as these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads up, because <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> deliverance is getting near.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">With that he spoke an illustration to them: “Note the fig tree and all the other trees:</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">When they are already in the bud, by observing it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know for yourselves that now the summer is near.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In this way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, This generation will by no means pass away until all things occur.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“But pay attention to yourselves that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span></span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">So by day he would be teaching in the temple, but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the Mount of Olives.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And all the people would come early in the day to him in the temple to hear him.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the festival of the unfermented cakes, the so-called Passover, was getting near.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Also, the chief priests and the scribes were seeking the effective way for them to get rid of him, for they were in fear of the people.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But Satan entered into Judas, the one called Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot, who was numbered among the twelve;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and he went off and talked with the chief priests and [temple] captains about the effective way to betray him to them.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Well, they rejoiced and agreed to give him silver money.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So he consented, and he began to seek a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The day of the unfermented cakes now arrived, on which the passover [victim] must be sacrificed;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and he dispatched Peter and John, saying: “Go and get the passover ready for us to eat.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">They said to him: “Where do you want us to get [it] ready?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">He said to them: “Look! When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> enter into the city a man carrying an earthenware vessel of water will meet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Follow him into the house into which he enters.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say to the landlord of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you: “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?”’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And that [man] will show <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a large upper room furnished. Get [it] ready there.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So they departed and found it just as he had said to them, and they got the passover ready.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At length when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this passover with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before I suffer;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">for I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I will not eat it again until it becomes fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And, accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said: “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">for I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, From now on I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the kingdom of God arrives.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body which is to be given in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Also, the cup in the same way after they had the evening meal, he saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> behalf.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“But, look! the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Because the Son of man is going his way according to what is marked out; all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So they started to discuss among themselves the question of which of them would really be the one that was about to do this.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them seemed to be greatest.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But he said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, though, are not to be that way. But let him that is the greatest among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become as the youngest, and the one acting as chief as the one ministering.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For which one is greater, the one reclining at the table or the one ministering? Is it not the one reclining at the table? But I am in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst as the one ministering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“However, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">and I make a covenant with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men to sift <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as wheat.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, when once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both into prison and into death.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But he said: “I tell you, Peter, A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">He also said to them: “When I sent <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forth without purse and food pouch and sandals, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not want for anything, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?” They said: “No!”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then he said to them: “But now let the one that has a purse take it up, likewise also a food pouch; and let the one having no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">For I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that this which is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘And he was reckoned with lawless ones.’ For that which concerns me is having an accomplishment.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then they said: “Lord, look! here are two swords.” He said to them: “It is enough.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">On going out he went as customarily to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Having come to the place he said to them: “Carry on prayer, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not enter into temptation.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And he himself drew away from them about a stone’s throw, and bent his knees and began to pray,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">saying: “Father, if you wish, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">But getting into an agony he continued praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And he rose from prayer, went to the disciples and found them slumbering from grief;</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">and he said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sleeping? Rise and carry on prayer, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not enter into temptation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">While he was yet speaking, look! a crowd, and the [man] called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them; and he approached Jesus to kiss him.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">But Jesus said to him: “Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">When those about him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">A certain one of them even did strike the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">But in reply Jesus said: “L<span class="smallcaps">ET</span> it go as far as this.” And he touched the ear and healed him.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and older men that had come there for him: “Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">While I was with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the temple day after day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not stretch out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands against me. But this is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hour and the authority of darkness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Then they arrested him and led him off and brought him into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">When they lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting in among them.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">But a certain servant girl saw him sitting by the bright fire and looked him over and said: “This man also was with him.”</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman.”</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">And after a short time another person seeing him said: “You also are one of them.” But Peter said: “Man, I am not.”</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">And after about an hour intervened a certain other [man] began insisting strongly: “For a certainty this [man] also was with him; for, in fact, he is a Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;an!”</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And instantly, while he was yet speaking, a cock crowed.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter, and Peter recalled the utterance of the Lord when he said to him: “Before a cock crows today you will disown me three times.”</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">Now the men that had him in custody began to make fun of him, hitting him;</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">and after covering him over they would ask and say: “Prophesy. Who is it that struck you?”</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">And they went on saying many other things in blasphemy against him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">At length when it became day, the assembly of older men of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they haled him into their San&acute;he&middot;drin hall, saying:</span> <a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">“If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them: “Even if I told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would not believe it at all.</span> <a name="bk68" class="vsAnchor">68</a>
       <span id="vs68">Moreover, if I questioned <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would not answer at all.</span> <a name="bk69" class="vsAnchor">69</a>
       <span id="vs69">However, from now on the Son of man will be sitting at the powerful right hand of God.”</span> <a name="bk70" class="vsAnchor">70</a>
       <span id="vs70">At this they all said: “Are you, therefore, the Son of God?” He said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves are saying that I am.”</span> <a name="bk71" class="vsAnchor">71</a>
       <span id="vs71">They said: “Why do we need further witness? For we ourselves have heard [it] out of his own mouth.”</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="56">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">So the multitude of them rose, one and all, and led him to Pilate.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then they started to accuse him, saying: “This man we found subverting our nation and forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar and saying he himself is Christ a king.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Now Pilate asked him the question: “Are you the king of the Jews?” In answer to him he said: “You yourself are saying [it].”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: “I find no crime in this man.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But they began to be insistent, saying: “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Ju&middot;de&acute;a, even starting out from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee to here.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">On hearing that, Pilate asked whether the man was a Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;an,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and, after ascertaining that he was from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him on to Herod, who was also himself in Jerusalem in these days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When Herod saw Jesus he rejoiced greatly, for over a considerable time he was wanting to see him because of having heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now he began to question him with a good many words; but he made him no answer.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">However, the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Herod together with his soldier guards discredited him, and he made fun of him by clothing him with a bright garment and sent him back to Pilate.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Both Herod and Pilate now became friends with each other on that very day; for before that they had continued at enmity between themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Pilate then called the chief priests and the rulers and the people together</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt, and, look! I examined him in front of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> but found in this man no ground for the charges <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are bringing against him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us; and, look! nothing deserving of death has been committed by him.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">——</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But with their whole multitude they cried out, saying: “Take this one away, but release Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas to us!”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">(Which [man] had been thrown into prison for a certain sedition occurring in the city and for murder.)</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Again Pilate called out to them, because he wanted to release Jesus.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then they began to yell, saying: “Impale! Impale him!”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">The third time he said to them: “Why, what bad thing did this [man] do? I found nothing deserving of death in him; I will therefore chastise and release him.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At this they began to be urgent, with loud voices, demanding that he be impaled; and their voices began to win out.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So Pilate gave sentence for their demand to be met:</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">he released the man that had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder and whom they were demanding, but he surrendered Jesus to their will.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Now as they led him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain native of Cy&middot;re&acute;ne, coming from the country, and they placed the torture stake upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But there was following him a great multitude of the people and of women who kept beating themselves in grief and bewailing him.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Jesus turned to the women and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me. On the contrary, weep for yourselves and for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> children;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">because, look! days are coming in which people will say, ‘Happy are the barren women, and the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse!’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then they will start to say to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Because if they do these things when the tree is moist, what will occur when it is withered?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But two other men, evildoers, were also being led to be executed with him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And when they got to the place called Skull, there they impaled him and the evildoers, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">[[But Jesus was saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”]] Furthermore, to distribute his garments, they cast lots.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And the people stood looking on. But the rulers were sneering, saying: “Others he saved; let him save himself, if this one is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Even the soldiers made fun of him, coming close and offering him sour wine</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">and saying: “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">There was also an inscription over him: “This is the king of the Jews.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">But one of the hung evildoers began to say abusively to him: “You are the Christ, are you not? Save yourself and us.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">In reply the other rebuked him and said: “Do you not fear God at all, now that you are in the same judgment?</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And we, indeed, justly so, for we are receiving in full what we deserve for things we did; but this [man] did nothing out of the way.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And he went on to say: “Jesus, remember me when you get into your kingdom.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And he said to him: “Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Well, by now it was about the sixth hour, and yet a darkness fell over all the earth until the ninth hour,</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">because the sunlight failed; then the curtain of the sanctuary was rent down the middle.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And Jesus called with a loud voice and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” When he had said this, he expired.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Because of seeing what occurred the army officer began to glorify God, saying: “Really this man was righteous.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle, when they beheld the things that occurred, began to return, beating their breasts.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">Moreover, all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance. Also, women, who together had followed him from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, were standing beholding these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">And, look! a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man—</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">this [man] had not voted in support of their design and action—he was from Ar&middot;i&middot;ma&middot;the&acute;a, a city of the Ju&middot;de&acute;ans, and was waiting for the kingdom of God;</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen, and he laid him in a tomb carved in the rock, in which no man had yet lain.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Now it was the day of Preparation, and the evening light of the sabbath was approaching.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">But the women, who had come with him out of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, followed along and took a look at the memorial tomb and how his body was laid;</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils. But, of course, they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.</span>

<p class="title">Luke 24:1-53</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="53">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">On the first day of the week, however, they went very early to the tomb, bearing the spices they had prepared.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But they found the stone rolled away from the memorial tomb,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and when they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">While they were in perplexity over this, look! two men in flashing clothing stood by them.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">As the [women] became frightened and kept their faces turned to the ground, the [men] said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> looking for the living One among the dead?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">[[He is not here, but has been raised up.]] Recall how he spoke to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> while he was yet in Gal&acute;i&middot;lee,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">saying that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be impaled and yet on the third day rise.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So they called his sayings to mind,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and they returned from the memorial tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">They were the Mag&acute;da&middot;lene Mary, and Jo&middot;an&acute;na, and Mary the [mother] of James. Also, the rest of the women with them were telling the apostles these things.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, these sayings appeared as nonsense to them and they would not believe the [women].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">[[But Peter rose and ran to the memorial tomb, and, stooping forward, he beheld the bandages alone. So he went off, wondering within himself at what had occurred.]]</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But, look! on that very day two of them were journeying to a village about seven miles distant from Jerusalem [and] named Em&middot;ma&acute;us,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and they were conversing with each other over all these things that had come about.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now as they were conversing and discussing, Jesus himself approached and began walking with them;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">He said to them: “What are these matters that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are debating between yourselves as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> walk along?” And they stood still with sad faces.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In answer the one named Cle&acute;o&middot;pas said to him: “Are you dwelling as an alien by yourself in Jerusalem and so do not know the things that have occurred in her in these days?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he said to them: “What things?” They said to him: “The things concerning Jesus the Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute;, who became a prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to the sentence of death and impaled him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But we were hoping that this [man] was the one destined to deliver Israel; yes, and besides all these things, this makes the third day since these things occurred.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Moreover, certain women from among us also astonished us, because they had been early to the memorial tomb</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but did not find his body and they came saying they had also seen a supernatural sight of angels, who said he is alive.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Further, some of those with us went off to the memorial tomb; and they found it so, just as the women had said, but they did not see him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So he said to them: “O senseless ones and slow in heart to believe on all the things the prophets spoke!</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And commencing at Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Finally they got close to the village where they were journeying, and he made as if he was journeying on farther.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But they used pressure upon him, saying: “Stay with us, because it is toward evening and the day has already declined.” With that he went in to stay with them.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And as he was reclining with them at the meal he took the loaf, blessed it, broke it and began to hand it to them.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him; and he disappeared from them.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And they said to each other: “Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And in that very hour they rose and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">saying: “For a fact the Lord was raised up and he appeared to Simon!”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Now they themselves related the [events] on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the loaf.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">While they were speaking of these things he himself stood in their midst [[and said to them: “May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have peace.”]]</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But because they were terrified, and had become frightened, they were imagining they beheld a spirit.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">So he said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> troubled, and why is it doubts come up in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts?</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; feel me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> behold that I have.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">[[And as he said this he showed them his hands and his feet.]]</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">But while they were still not believing for sheer joy and were wondering, he said to them: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have something there to eat?”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And they handed him a piece of broiled fish;</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">and he took it and ate it before their eyes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">He now said to them: “These are my words which I spoke to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> while I was yet with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that all the things written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled.”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures,</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">and he said to them: “In this way it is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from among the dead on the third day,</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">and on the basis of his name repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nations—starting out from Jerusalem,</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48"><span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to be witnesses of these things.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And, look! I am sending forth upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that which is promised by my Father. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, though, abide in the city until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become clothed with power from on high.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">But he led them out as far as Beth&acute;a&middot;ny, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">As he was blessing them he was parted from them and began to be borne up to heaven.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And they did obeisance to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">And they were continually in the temple blessing God.</span>
