<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of [the] watery deep; and God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And God proceeded to say: “Let light come to be.” Then there came to be light.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">After that God saw that the light was good, and God brought about a division between the light and the darkness.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And God began calling the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a first day.</span>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And God went on to say: “Let an expanse come to be in between the waters and let a dividing occur between the waters and the waters.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then God proceeded to make the expanse and to make a division between the waters that should be beneath the expanse and the waters that should be above the expanse. And it came to be so.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And God began to call the expanse Heaven. And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a second day.</span>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And God went on to say: “Let the waters under the heavens be brought together into one place and let the dry land appear.” And it came to be so.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And God began calling the dry land Earth, but the bringing together of the waters he called Seas. Further, God saw that [it was] good.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And God went on to say: “Let the earth cause grass to shoot forth, vegetation bearing seed, fruit trees yielding fruit according to their kinds, the seed of which is in it, upon the earth.” And it came to be so.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the earth began to put forth grass, vegetation bearing seed according to its kind and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in it according to its kind. Then God saw that [it was] good.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs15">And they must serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it came to be so.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And God proceeded to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness. Then God saw that [it was] good.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a fourth day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And God went on to say: “Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God got to see that [it was] good.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters in the sea basins, and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a fifth day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And God went on to say: “Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.” And it came to be so.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And God proceeded to make the wild beast of the earth according to its kind and the domestic animal according to its kind and every moving animal of the ground according to its kind. And God got to see that [it was] good.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And God went on to say: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Further, God blessed them and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And God went on to say: “Here I have given to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all vegetation bearing seed which is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. To <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> let it serve as food.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And to every wild beast of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul I have given all green vegetation for food.” And it came to be so.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Thus the heavens and the earth and all their army came to their completion.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And by the seventh day God came to the completion of his work that he had made, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had made.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And God proceeded to bless the seventh day and make it sacred, because on it he has been resting from all his work that God has created for the purpose of making.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time of their being created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now there was as yet no bush of the field found in the earth and no vegetation of the field was as yet sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain upon the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But a mist would go up from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in E&acute;den, toward the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree desirable to one’s sight and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now there was a river issuing out of E&acute;den to water the garden, and from there it began to be parted and it became, as it were, four heads.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The first one’s name is Pi&acute;shon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Hav&acute;i&middot;lah, where there is gold.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the gold of that land is good. There also are the bdellium gum and the onyx stone.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the name of the second river is Gi&acute;hon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the name of the third river is Hid&acute;de&middot;kel; it is the one going to the east of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a. And the fourth river is the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Jehovah God proceeded to take the man and settle him in the garden of E&acute;den to cultivate it and to take care of it.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Jehovah God also laid this command upon the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jehovah God went on to say: “It is not good for the man to continue by himself. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now Jehovah God was forming from the ground every wild beast of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call it, each living soul, that was its name.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So the man was calling the names of all the domestic animals and of the flying creatures of the heavens and of every wild beast of the field, but for man there was found no helper as a complement of him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Hence Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man and, while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then the man said:<br><span class="p">“This is at last bone of my bones</span><br><span class="z">And flesh of my flesh.</span><br><span class="p">This one will be called Woman,</span><br><span class="z">Because from man this one was taken.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife, and yet they did not become ashamed.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the serpent proved to be the most cautious of all the wild beasts of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it began to say to the woman: “Is it really so that God said <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not eat from every tree of the garden?”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At this the woman said to the serpent: “Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But as for [eating] of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not eat from it, no, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not touch it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not die.’”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At this the serpent said to the woman: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> positively will not die.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For God knows that in the very day of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eating from it <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes are bound to be opened and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are bound to be like God, <span class="smallcaps">KNOWING</span> good and bad.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Consequently the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes, yes, the tree was desirable to look upon. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward she gave some also to her husband when with her and he began eating it.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then the eyes of both of them became opened and they began to realize that they were naked. Hence they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Later they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day, and the man and his wife went into hiding from the face of Jehovah God in between the trees of the garden.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him: “Where are you?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Finally he said: “Your voice I heard in the garden, but I was afraid because I was naked and so I hid myself.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At that he said: “Who told you that you were naked? From the tree from which I commanded you not to eat have you eaten?”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the man went on to say: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me [fruit] from the tree and so I ate.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">With that Jehovah God said to the woman: “What is this you have done?” To this the woman replied: “The serpent—it deceived me and so I ate.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah God proceeded to say to the serpent: “Because you have done this thing, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild beasts of the field. Upon your belly you will go and dust is what you will eat all the days of your life.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">To the woman he said: “I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in birth pangs you will bring forth children, and your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and took to eating from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And thorns and thistles it will grow for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">After this Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she had to become the mother of everyone living.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah God proceeded to make long garments of skin for Adam and for his wife and to clothe them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jehovah God went on to say: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad, and now in order that he may not put his hand out and actually take [fruit] also from the tree of life and eat and live to time indefinite,—”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">With that Jehovah God put him out of the garden of E&acute;den to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And so he drove the man out and posted at the east of the garden of E&acute;den the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning itself continually to guard the way to the tree of life.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 4:1-26</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="26">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Adam had intercourse with Eve his wife and she became pregnant. In time she gave birth to Cain and said: “I have produced a man with the aid of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">And Abel came to be a herder of sheep, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it came about at the expiration of some time that Cain proceeded to bring some fruits of the ground as an offering to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But as for Abel, he too brought some firstlings of his flock, even their fatty pieces. Now while Jehovah was looking with favor upon Abel and his offering,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">he did not look with any favor upon Cain and upon his offering. And Cain grew hot with great anger, and his countenance began to fall.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At this Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you hot with anger and why has your countenance fallen?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">If you turn to doing good, will there not be an exaltation? But if you do not turn to doing good, there is sin crouching at the entrance, and for you is its craving; and will you, for your part, get the mastery over it?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">After that Cain said to Abel his brother: [“Let us go over into the field.”] So it came about that while they were in the field Cain proceeded to assault Abel his brother and kill him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Later on Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is Abel your brother?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">At this he said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood at your hand.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its power. A wanderer and a fugitive you will become in the earth.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At this Cain said to Jehovah: “My punishment for error is too great to carry.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Here you are actually driving me this day from off the surface of the ground, and from your face I shall be concealed; and I must become a wanderer and fugitive on the earth, and it is certain that anyone finding me will kill me.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this Jehovah said to him: “For that reason anyone killing Cain must suffer vengeance seven times.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs15-2">And so Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in order that no one finding him should strike him.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">With that Cain went away from the face of Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Fugitiveness to the east of E&acute;den.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Afterward Cain had intercourse with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to E&acute;noch. Then he engaged in building a city and called the city’s name by the name of his son E&acute;noch.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Later there was born to E&acute;noch I&acute;rad. And I&acute;rad became father to Me&middot;hu&acute;ja&middot;el, and Me&middot;hu&acute;ja&middot;el became father to Me&middot;thu&acute;sha&middot;el, and Me&middot;thu&acute;sha&middot;el became father to La&acute;mech.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And La&acute;mech proceeded to take two wives for himself. The name of the first was A&acute;dah and the name of the second was Zil&acute;lah.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">In time A&acute;dah gave birth to Ja&acute;bal. He proved to be the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the name of his brother was Ju&acute;bal. He proved to be the founder of all those who handle the harp and the pipe.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">As for Zil&acute;lah, she too gave birth to Tu&acute;bal-cain, the forger of every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tu&acute;bal-cain was Na&acute;a&middot;mah.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Consequently La&acute;mech composed these words for his wives A&acute;dah and Zil&acute;lah:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs23-2">“Hear my voice, you wives of La&acute;mech;<br><span class="z">Give ear to my saying:</span><br><span class="p">A man I have killed for wounding me,</span><br><span class="z">Yes, a young man for giving me a blow.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">If seven times Cain is to be avenged,<br><span class="z">Then La&acute;mech seventy times and seven.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Adam proceeded to have intercourse again with his wife and so she gave birth to a son and called his name Seth, because, as she said: “God has appointed another seed in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And to Seth also there was born a son and he proceeded to call his name E&acute;nosh. At that time a start was made of calling on the name of Jehovah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now it came about that when men started to grow in numbers on the surface of the ground and daughters were born to them,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">then the sons of the [true] God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good-looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">After that Jehovah said: “My spirit shall not act toward man indefinitely in that he is also flesh. Accordingly his days shall amount to a hundred and twenty years.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">The Neph&acute;i&middot;lim proved to be in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of the [true] God continued to have relations with the daughters of men and they bore sons to them, they were the mighty ones who were of old, the men of fame.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Consequently Jehovah saw that the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Jehovah felt regrets that he had made men in the earth, and he felt hurt at his heart.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So Jehovah said: “I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the surface of the ground, from man to domestic animal, to moving animal and to flying creature of the heavens, because I do regret that I have made them.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">This is the history of Noah.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs9-2">Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In time Noah became father to three sons, Shem, Ham and Ja&acute;pheth.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the earth came to be ruined in the sight of the [true] God and the earth became filled with violence.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After that God said to Noah: “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is full of violence as a result of them; and here I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Make for yourself an ark out of wood of a resinous tree. You will make compartments in the ark, and you must cover it inside and outside with tar.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And this is how you will make it: three hundred cubits the length of the ark, fifty cubits its width, and thirty cubits its height.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">You will make a <i>tso&acute;har</i> [roof; or, window] for the ark, and you will complete it to the extent of a cubit upward, and the entrance of the ark you will put in its side; you will make it with a lower [story], a second [story] and a third [story].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And as for me, here I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force of life is active from under the heavens. Everything that is in the earth will expire.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I do establish my covenant with you; and you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And of every living creature of every sort of flesh, two of each, you will bring into the ark to preserve them alive with you. Male and female they will be.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Of the flying creatures according to their kinds and of the domestic animals according to their kinds, of all moving animals of the ground according to their kinds, two of each will go in there to you to preserve them alive.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And as for you, take for yourself every sort of food that is eaten; and you must gather it to yourself, and it must serve as food for you and for them.”</span>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>

       <span id="vs1">After that God remembered Noah and every wild beast and every domestic animal that was with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters began to subside.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the springs of the watery deep and the floodgates of the heavens became stopped up, and so the downpour from the heavens was restrained.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the waters began receding from off the earth, progressively receding; and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lacking.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ar&acute;a&middot;rat.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the waters kept on progressively lessening until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So it occurred that at the end of forty days Noah proceeded to open the window of the ark that he had made.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">After that he sent out a raven, and it continued flying outdoors, going and returning, until the waters dried off the earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Later he sent out from him a dove to see whether the waters had abated from the surface of the ground.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the dove did not find any resting-place for the sole of its foot, and so it returned to him into the ark because the waters were yet upon the surface of the whole earth. At that he put his hand out and took it and brought it to himself inside the ark.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And he went on waiting still another seven days, and once again he sent out the dove from the ark.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Later on the dove came to him about the time of evening and, look! there was an olive leaf freshly plucked in its bill, and so Noah got to know that the waters had abated from the earth.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went on waiting still another seven days. Then he sent out the dove, but it did not come back again to him anymore.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, it came about that the waters had drained from off the earth; and Noah proceeded to remove the covering of the ark and to look, and here the surface of the ground had drained dry.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried off.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">God now spoke to Noah, saying:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Every living creature that is with you of every sort of flesh, among the flying creatures and among the beasts and among all the moving animals that move upon the earth, bring out with you, as they must swarm in the earth and be fruitful and become many upon the earth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that Noah went out, and also his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Every living creature, every moving animal and every flying creature, everything that moves on the earth, according to their families they went out of the ark.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Noah began to build an altar to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts and of all the clean flying creatures and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah began to smell a restful odor, and so Jehovah said in his heart: “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground on man’s account, because the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again shall I deal every living thing a blow just as I have done.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For all the days the earth continues, seed sowing and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, will never cease.”</span>

       <span id="vs11">Yes, I do establish my covenant with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: No more will all flesh be cut off by waters of a deluge, and no more will there occur a deluge to bring the earth to ruin.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am giving between me and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and every living soul that is with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for the generations to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs16">And the rainbow must occur in the cloud, and I shall certainly see it to remember the covenant to time indefinite between God and every living soul among all flesh that is upon the earth.”</span>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I do establish between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”</span>

       <span id="vs19">These three were Noah’s sons, and from these was all the earth’s population spread abroad.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now Noah started off as a farmer and proceeded to plant a vineyard.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he began drinking of the wine and became intoxicated, and so he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later Ham the father of Ca&acute;naan saw his father’s nakedness and went telling it to his two brothers outside.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At that Shem and Ja&acute;pheth took a mantle and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backwards. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness, while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Finally Noah awoke from his wine and got to know what his youngest son had done to him.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At this he said:</span>
</p>

<p class="p">

</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he added:<br><span class="p">“Blessed be Jehovah, Shem’s God,</span><br><span class="z">And let Ca&acute;naan become a slave to him.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>

Then he built an altar there to Jehovah and began to call on the name of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Afterward A&acute;bram broke camp, going then from encampment to encampment toward the Neg&acute;eb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now a famine arose in the land and A&acute;bram made his way down toward Egypt to reside there as an alien, because the famine was severe in the land.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about that as soon as he got near to entering Egypt, then he said to Sar&acute;ai his wife: “Please, now! I well know you are a woman beautiful in appearance.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So it is bound to happen that the Egyptians will see you and will say, ‘This is his wife.’ And they will certainly kill me, but you they will preserve alive.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Please say you are my sister, in order that it may go well with me on your account, and my soul will be certain to live due to you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So it happened that, as soon as A&acute;bram entered Egypt, the Egyptians got to see the woman, that she was very beautiful.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the princes of Phar&acute;aoh also got to see her and they began praising her to Phar&acute;aoh, so that the woman was taken to the house of Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he treated A&acute;bram well on her account, and he came to have sheep and cattle and asses and menservants and maidservants and she-asses and camels.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then Jehovah touched Phar&acute;aoh and his household with great plagues because of Sar&acute;ai, A&acute;bram’s wife.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">With that Phar&acute;aoh called A&acute;bram and said: “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I was about to take her as my wife? And now here is your wife. Take her and go!”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Phar&acute;aoh issued commands to men concerning him, and they went escorting him and his wife and all that he had.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Following that A&acute;bram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, to the Neg&acute;eb.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And A&acute;bram was heavily stocked with herds and silver and gold.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he made his way from encampment to encampment out of the Neg&acute;eb and to Beth&acute;el, to the place where his tent had been at first between Beth&acute;el and A&acute;i,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">to the place of the altar that he had made there originally; and A&acute;bram proceeded to call there on the name of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now Lot, who was going along with A&acute;bram, also owned sheep and cattle and tents.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So the land did not allow for them to dwell all together, because their goods had become many and they were not able to dwell all together.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And a quarrel arose between the herders of A&acute;bram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock; and at that time the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ite and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zite were dwelling in the land.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Hence A&acute;bram said to Lot: “Please, do not let any quarreling continue between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we men are brothers.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Is not the whole land available to you? Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So Lot raised his eyes and saw the whole District of the Jordan, that all of it was a well-watered region before Jehovah brought Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah to ruin, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as far as Zo&acute;ar.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Lot chose for himself the whole District of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east. So they separated the one from the other.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">A&acute;bram dwelt in the land of Ca&acute;naan, but Lot dwelt among the cities of the District. Finally he pitched tent near Sod&acute;om.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the men of Sod&acute;om were bad and were gross sinners against Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah said to A&acute;bram after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">because all the land at which you are looking, to you and to your seed I am going to give it until time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I will constitute your seed like the dust particles of the earth, so that, if a man could be able to count the dust particles of the earth, then your seed could be numbered.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Get up, go about in the land through its length and through its breadth, because to you I am going to give it.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So A&acute;bram continued to live in tents. Later on he came and dwelt among the big trees of Mam&acute;re, which are in He&acute;bron; and there he proceeded to build an altar to Jehovah.</span>

       <span id="vs5">And in the fourteenth year Ched&middot;or&middot;la&middot;o&acute;mer came, and also the kings who were with him, and they inflicted defeats on the Reph&acute;a&middot;im in Ash&acute;te&middot;roth-kar&middot;na&acute;im, and the Zu&acute;zim in Ham, and the E&acute;mim in Sha&acute;veh-kir&middot;i&middot;a&middot;tha&acute;im,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After that a man who had escaped came and told A&acute;bram the Hebrew.

       <span id="vs14">Thus A&acute;bram got to hear that his brother had been taken captive. With that he mustered his trained men, three hundred and eighteen slaves born in his household, and went in pursuit up to Dan.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And by night he resorted to dividing his forces, he and his slaves, against them, and thus he defeated them and kept in pursuit of them up to Ho&acute;bah, which is north of Damascus.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he proceeded to recover all the goods, and he recovered also Lot his brother and his goods and also the women and the people.</span>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the king of Sod&acute;om went out to meet him after he returned from defeating Ched&middot;or&middot;la&middot;o&acute;mer and the kings that were with him, to the Low Plain of Sha&acute;veh, that is, the king’s Low Plain.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs22">At this A&acute;bram said to the king of Sod&acute;om: “I do lift up my hand [in an oath] to Jehovah the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">that, from a thread to a sandal lace, no, I shall take nothing from anything that is yours, in order that you may not say, ‘It was I who made A&acute;bram rich.’</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Nothing for me! Only what the young men have already eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, A&acute;ner, Esh&acute;col and Mam&acute;re—let them take their share.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After these things the word of Jehovah came to A&acute;bram in a vision, saying: “Do not fear, A&acute;bram. I am a shield for you. Your reward will be very great.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At this A&acute;bram said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, what will you give me, seeing that I am going childless and the one who will possess my house is a man of Damascus, E&middot;li&middot;e&acute;zer?”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And A&acute;bram added: “Look! You have given me no seed, and, look! a son of my household is succeeding me as heir.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But, look! the word of Jehovah to him was in these words: “This man will not succeed you as heir, but one who will come out of your own inward parts will succeed you as heir.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">He now brought him outside and said: “Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars, if you are possibly able to count them.” And he went on to say to him: “So your seed will become.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he put faith in Jehovah; and he proceeded to count it to him as righteousness.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then he added to him: “I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans to give you this land to take it in possession.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">To this he said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, by what shall I know that I shall take it in possession?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In turn he said to him: “Take for me a three-year-old heifer and a three-year-old she-goat and a three-year-old ram and a turtledove and a young pigeon.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So he took all these to himself and cut them in two and put each part of them so as to match the other, but the birds he did not cut in pieces.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the birds of prey began to descend upon the carcasses, but A&acute;bram kept driving them away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">After a while the sun was about to set, and a deep sleep fell upon A&acute;bram, and, look! a frightfully great darkness was falling upon him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he began to say to A&acute;bram: “You may know for sure that your seed will become an alien resident in a land not theirs, and they will have to serve them, and these will certainly afflict them for four hundred years.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But the nation that they will serve I am judging, and after that they will go out with many goods.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As for you, you will go to your forefathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But in the fourth generation they will return here, because the error of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites has not yet come to completion.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">The sun was now setting and a dense darkness came and, look! a smoking furnace and a fiery torch that passed in between these pieces.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">On that day Jehovah concluded with A&acute;bram a covenant, saying: “To your seed I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes:</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">the Ken&acute;ites and the Ken&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Kad&acute;mon&middot;ites</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Sar&acute;ai, A&acute;bram’s wife, had borne him no children; but she had an Egyptian maidservant and her name was Ha&acute;gar.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Hence Sar&acute;ai said to A&acute;bram: “Please now! Jehovah has shut me off from bearing children. Please, have relations with my maidservant. Perhaps I may get children from her.” So A&acute;bram listened to the voice of Sar&acute;ai.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Sar&acute;ai, A&acute;bram’s wife, took Ha&acute;gar, her Egyptian maidservant, at the end of ten years of A&acute;bram’s dwelling in the land of Ca&acute;naan, and gave her to A&acute;bram her husband as his wife.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Accordingly he had relations with Ha&acute;gar, and she became pregnant. When she became aware that she was pregnant, then her mistress began to be despised in her eyes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this Sar&acute;ai said to A&acute;bram: “The violence done me be upon you. I myself gave my maidservant over to your bosom, and she became aware that she was pregnant, and I began to be despised in her eyes. May Jehovah judge between me and you.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So A&acute;bram said to Sar&acute;ai: “Look! Your maidservant is at your disposal. Do to her what is good in your eyes.” Then Sar&acute;ai began to humiliate her so that she ran away from her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a fountain of waters in the wilderness, at the fountain on the way to Shur.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he began to say: “Ha&acute;gar, maidservant of Sar&acute;ai, just where have you come from and where are you going?” To this she said: “Why, from Sar&acute;ai my mistress I am running away.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah’s angel went on to say to her: “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Jehovah’s angel said to her: “I shall greatly multiply your seed, so that it will not be numbered for multitude.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Further Jehovah’s angel added to her: “Here you are pregnant, and you shall give birth to a son and must call his name Ish&acute;ma&middot;el; for Jehovah has heard your affliction.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for him, he will become a zebra of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and the hand of everyone will be against him; and before the face of all his brothers he will tabernacle.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then she began to call the name of Jehovah, who was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,” for she said: “Have I here actually looked upon him who sees me?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">That is why the well was called Be&acute;er-la&acute;hai-roi. Here it is between Ka&acute;desh and Be&acute;red.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Later on Ha&acute;gar bore to A&acute;bram a son and A&acute;bram called the name of his son whom Ha&acute;gar bore Ish&acute;ma&middot;el.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>

       <span id="vs17">At this Abraham fell upon his face and began to laugh and to say in his heart: “Will a man a hundred years old have a child born, and will Sarah, yes, will a woman ninety years old give birth?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">After that Abraham said to the [true] God: “O that Ish&acute;ma&middot;el might live before you!”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">To this God said: “Sarah your wife is indeed bearing you a son, and you must call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him for a covenant to time indefinite to his seed after him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But as regards Ish&acute;ma&middot;el I have heard you. Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. He will certainly produce twelve chieftains, and I will make him become a great nation.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">However, my covenant I shall establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time next year.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">With that God finished speaking with him and went up from Abraham.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Abraham then proceeded to take Ish&acute;ma&middot;el his son and all the men born in his house and everyone purchased with money of his, every male among the men of the household of Abraham, and he went to circumcising the flesh of their foreskins in this very day, just as God had spoken with him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Ish&acute;ma&middot;el his son was thirteen years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In this very day Abraham got circumcised, and also Ish&acute;ma&middot;el his son.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And all the men of his household, anyone born in the house and anyone purchased with money from a foreigner, got circumcised with him.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 18:1-33</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="33">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Afterward Jehovah appeared to him among the big trees of Mam&acute;re, while he was sitting at the entrance of the tent about the heat of the day.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">When he raised his eyes, then he looked and there three men were standing some distance from him. When he caught sight of them he began running to meet them from the entrance of the tent and proceeded to bow down to the earth.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then he said: “Jehovah, if, now, I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Let a little water be taken, please, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must have <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet washed. Then recline under the tree.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And let me get a piece of bread, and refresh <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts. Following that, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can pass on, because that is why <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have passed this way to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> servant.” At this they said: “All right. You may do just as you have spoken.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Abraham went hurrying to the tent to Sarah and said: “Hurry! Get three seah measures of fine flour, knead the dough and make round cakes.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Next Abraham ran to the herd and proceeded to get a tender and good young bull and to give it to the attendant, and he went hurrying to get it ready.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He then took butter and milk and the young bull that he had got ready and set it before them. Then he himself kept standing by them under the tree as they were eating.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">They now said to him: “Where is Sarah your wife?” To this he said: “Here in the tent!”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So he continued: “I am surely going to return to you next year at this time, and, look! Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the tent entrance, and it was behind the man.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Abraham and Sarah were old, being advanced in years. Sarah had stopped having menstruation.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Hence Sarah began to laugh inside herself, saying: “After I am worn out, shall I really have pleasure, my lord being old besides?”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jehovah said to Abraham: “Why was it that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Shall I really and truly give birth although I have become old?’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah? At the appointed time I shall return to you, next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But Sarah began to deny it, saying: “I did not laugh!” For she was afraid. At this he said: “No! but you did laugh.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Later the men got up from there and looked down toward Sod&acute;om, and Abraham was walking with them to escort them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Jehovah said: “Am I keeping covered from Abraham what I am doing?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Why, Abraham is surely going to become a nation great and mighty, and all the nations of the earth must bless themselves by means of him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For I have become acquainted with him in order that he may command his sons and his household after him so that they shall keep Jehovah’s way to do righteousness and judgment; in order that Jehovah may certainly bring upon Abraham what he has spoken about him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Consequently Jehovah said: “The cry of complaint about Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah, yes, it is loud, and their sin, yes, it is very heavy.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">I am quite determined to go down that I may see whether they act altogether according to the outcry over it that has come to me, and, if not, I can get to know it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At this point the men turned from there and got on their way to Sod&acute;om; but as for Jehovah, he was still standing before Abraham.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then Abraham approached and began to say: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Suppose there are fifty righteous men in the midst of the city. Will you, then, sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are inside it?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">It is unthinkable of you that you are acting in this manner to put to death the righteous man with the wicked one so that it has to occur with the righteous man as it does with the wicked! It is unthinkable of you. Is the Judge of all the earth not going to do what is right?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Jehovah said: “If I shall find in Sod&acute;om fifty righteous men in the midst of the city I will pardon the whole place on their account.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But Abraham went on to answer and say: “Please, here I have taken upon myself to speak to Jehovah, whereas I am dust and ashes.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Suppose the fifty righteous should be lacking five. Will you for the five bring the whole city to ruin?” To this he said: “I shall not bring it to ruin if I find there forty-five.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But yet again he spoke further to him and said: “Suppose forty are found there.” In turn he said: “I shall not do it on account of the forty.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But he continued: “May Jehovah, please, not grow hot with anger, but let me go on speaking: Suppose thirty are found there.” In turn he said: “I shall not do it if I find thirty there.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But he continued on: “Please, here I have taken upon myself to speak to Jehovah: Suppose twenty are found there.” In turn he said: “I shall not bring it to ruin on account of the twenty.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Finally he said: “May Jehovah, please, not grow hot with anger, but let me speak just this once: Suppose ten are found there.” In turn he said: “I shall not bring it to ruin on account of the ten.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then Jehovah went his way when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 19:1-38</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="38">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the two angels arrived at Sod&acute;om by evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sod&acute;om. When Lot caught sight of them, then he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the earth.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to say: “Please, now, my lords, turn aside, please, into the house of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> servant and stay overnight and have <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet washed. Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must get up early and travel on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way.” To this they said: “No, but in the public square is where we shall stay overnight.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But he was very insistent with them, so that they turned aside to him and came into his house. Then he made a feast for them, and he baked unfermented cakes, and they went to eating.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Before they could lie down, the men of the city, the men of Sod&acute;om, surrounded the house, from boy to old man, all the people in one mob.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And they kept calling out to Lot and saying to him: “Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have intercourse with them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Finally Lot went out to them to the entrance, but he shut the door behind him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then he said: “Please, my brothers, do not act badly.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Please, here I have two daughters who have never had intercourse with a man. Please, let me bring them out to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Then do to them as is good in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes. Only to these men do not do a thing, because that is why they have come under the shadow of my roof.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this they said: “Stand back there!” And they added: “This lone man came here to reside as an alien and yet he would actually play the judge. Now we are going to do worse to you than to them.” And they came pressing heavily in on the man, on Lot, and were getting near to break in the door.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So the men thrust out their hands and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and they shut the door.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, from the least to the greatest, so that they were wearing themselves out trying to find the entrance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the men said to Lot: “Do you have anyone else here? Son-in-law and your sons and your daughters and all who are yours in the city, bring out of the place!</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For we are bringing this place to ruin, because the outcry against them has grown loud before Jehovah, so that Jehovah sent us to bring the city to ruin.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Hence Lot went on out and began to speak to his sons-in-law who were to take his daughters, and he kept on saying: “Get up! Get out of this place, because Jehovah is bringing the city to ruin!” But in the eyes of his sons-in-law he seemed like a man who was joking.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, when the dawn ascended, then the angels became urgent with Lot, saying: “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are found here, for fear you may be swept away in the error of the city!”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When he kept lingering, then in the compassion of Jehovah upon him, the men seized hold of his hand and of the hand of his wife and of the hands of his two daughters and they proceeded to bring him out and to station him outside the city.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it came about that, as soon as they had brought them forth to the outskirts, he began to say: “Escape for your soul! Do not look behind you and do not stand still in all the District! Escape to the mountainous region for fear you may be swept away!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Lot said to them: “Not that, please, Jehovah!</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Please, now, your servant has found favor in your eyes so that you are magnifying your loving-kindness, which you have exercised with me to preserve my soul alive, but I—I am not able to escape to the mountainous region for fear calamity may keep close to me and I certainly die.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Please, now, this city is nearby to flee there and it is a small thing. May I, please, escape there—is it not a small thing?—and my soul will live on.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So he said to him: “Here I do show you consideration to this extent also, by my not overthrowing the city of which you have spoken.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Hurry! Escape there, because I am not able to do a thing until your arriving there!” That is why he called the name of the city Zo&acute;ar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">The sun had gone forth over the land when Lot arrived at Zo&acute;ar.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then Jehovah made it rain sulphur and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens, upon Sod&acute;om and upon Go&middot;mor&acute;rah.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So he went ahead overthrowing these cities, even the entire District and all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And his wife began to look around from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now Abraham made his way early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then he looked down toward Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah and toward all the land of the District and saw a sight. Why, here thick smoke ascended from the land like the thick smoke of a kiln!</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about that when God brought the cities of the District to ruin God kept Abraham in mind in that he took steps to send Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when overthrowing the cities among which Lot had been dwelling.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Later Lot went up from Zo&acute;ar and began dwelling in the mountainous region, and his two daughters along with him, because he got afraid of dwelling in Zo&acute;ar. So he began dwelling in a cave, he and his two daughters.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the firstborn proceeded to say to the younger woman: “Our father is old and there is not a man in the land to have relations with us according to the way of the whole earth.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Come, let us give our father wine to drink and let us lie down with him and preserve offspring from our father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So they kept giving their father wine to drink during that night; then the firstborn went in and lay down with her father, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And it came about on the next day that the firstborn then said to the younger: “Here I lay down with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink tonight also. Then you go in, lie down with him, and let us preserve offspring from our father.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">So they repeatedly gave their father wine to drink during that night also; then the younger got up and lay down with him, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And both the daughters of Lot became pregnant from their father.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">In time the firstborn became mother to a son and called his name Mo&acute;ab. He is the father of Mo&acute;ab, to this day.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">As for the younger, she too gave birth to a son and then called his name Ben-am&acute;mi. He is the father of the sons of Am&acute;mon, to this day.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="18">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Abraham moved camp from there to the land of the Neg&acute;eb and took up dwelling between Ka&acute;desh and Shur and residing as an alien at Ge&acute;rar.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Abraham repeated concerning Sarah his wife: “She is my sister.” With that A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech king of Ge&acute;rar sent and took Sarah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Afterward God came to A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech in a dream by night and said to him: “Here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken, since she is owned by another owner as his wife.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">However, A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech had not gone near her. Hence he said: “Jehovah, will you kill a nation that is really righteous?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Did not he say to me, ‘She is my sister’? and she—did not she too say, ‘He is my brother’? In the honesty of my heart and with innocency of my hands I have done this.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that the [true] God said to him in the dream: “I too have known that in the honesty of your heart you have done this, and I was also holding you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you. So keep living. But if you are not returning her, know that you will positively die, you and all who are yours.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech got up early in the morning and proceeded to call all his servants and to speak of all these things in their ears. And the men got very much afraid.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech called Abraham and said to him: “What have you done to us, and what sin have I committed against you, in that you have brought upon me and my kingdom a great sin? Deeds that should not have been done you have done in connection with me.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech went on to say to Abraham: “What did you have in view in that you have done this thing?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">To this Abraham said: “It was because I said to myself, ‘Doubtless there is no fear of God in this place, and they will certainly kill me because of my wife.’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And, besides, she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, only not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it came about that, when God caused me to wander from the house of my father, then I said to her, ‘This is your loving-kindness which you may exercise toward me: At every place where we shall come say of me: “He is my brother.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Following that A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech took sheep and cattle and menservants and maidservants and gave them to Abraham and returned to him Sarah his wife.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Further A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech said: “Here my land is available to you. Dwell where it is good in your eyes.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And to Sarah he said: “Here I do give a thousand silver pieces of money to your brother. Here it is for you a covering of the eyes to all who are with you, and before everybody, and you are cleared of reproach.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Abraham began to make supplication to the [true] God; and God proceeded to heal A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech and his wife and his slave girls, and they began bearing children.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For Jehovah had tightly shut up every womb of the house of A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="34">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah turned his attention to Sarah just as he had said, and Jehovah now did to Sarah just as he had spoken.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Sarah became pregnant and then bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Accordingly Abraham called the name of his son who had been born to him, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Abraham proceeded to circumcise Isaac his son when eight days old, just as God had commanded him.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Sarah said: “God has prepared laughter for me: everybody hearing of it will laugh at me.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And she added: “Who would have uttered to Abraham, ‘Sarah will certainly suckle children,’ whereas I have given birth to a son in his old age?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now the child kept growing and came to be weaned; and Abraham then prepared a big feast on the day of Isaac’s being weaned.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Sarah kept noticing the son of Ha&acute;gar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, poking fun.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So she began to say to Abraham: “Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir with my son, with Isaac!”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But the thing proved to be very displeasing to Abraham as regards his son.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then God said to Abraham: “Do not let anything that Sarah keeps saying to you be displeasing to you about the boy and about your slave girl. Listen to her voice, because it is by means of Isaac that what will be called your seed will be.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And as for the son of the slave girl, I shall also constitute him a nation, because he is your offspring.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin water bottle and gave it to Ha&acute;gar, setting it upon her shoulder, and the child, and then dismissed her. And she went her way and wandered about in the wilderness of Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Finally the water became exhausted in the skin bottle and she threw the child under one of the bushes.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then she went on and sat down by herself, about the distance of a bowshot away, because she said: “Let me not see it when the child dies.” So she sat down at a distance and began to raise her voice and weep.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At that God heard the voice of the boy, and God’s angel called to Ha&acute;gar out of the heavens and said to her: “What is the matter with you, Ha&acute;gar? Do not be afraid, because God has listened to the voice of the boy there where he is.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Get up, lift up the boy and take hold of him with your hand, because I shall constitute him a great nation.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then God opened her eyes so that she caught sight of a well of water; and she went and began to fill the skin bottle with water and to give the boy a drink.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And God continued to be with the boy, and he kept growing and dwelling in the wilderness; and he became an archer.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he took up dwelling in the wilderness of Pa&acute;ran, and his mother proceeded to take a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Now it came about at that time that A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech together with Phi&acute;col the chief of his army said to Abraham: “God is with you in everything you are doing.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So now swear to me here by God that you will not prove false to me and to my offspring and to my posterity; that, according to the loyal love with which I have dealt with you, you will deal with me and with the land in which you have been residing as an alien.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So Abraham said: “I shall swear.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">When Abraham criticized A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech severely as regards the well of water that the servants of A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech had seized by violence,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">then A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech said: “I do not know who did this thing, neither did you yourself tell it to me, and I myself have also not heard of it except today.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">With that Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech, and both of them proceeded to conclude a covenant.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">When Abraham set seven female lambs of the flock by themselves,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech went on to say to Abraham: “What is the meaning here of these seven female lambs that you have set by themselves?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>

<p class="title">Genesis 22:1-24</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="24">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now after these things it came about that the [true] God put Abraham to the test. Accordingly he said to him: “Abraham!” to which he said: “Here I am!”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he went on to say: “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and make a trip to the land of Mo&middot;ri&acute;ah and there offer him up as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall designate to you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his attendants with him and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering. Then he rose and went on the trip to the place that the [true] God designated to him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">It was first on the third day that Abraham raised his eyes and began to see the place from a distance.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Abraham now said to his attendants: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> stay here with the ass, but I and the boy want to go on over there and worship and return to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">After that Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and put it upon Isaac his son and took in his hands the fire and the slaughtering knife, and both of them went on together.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Isaac began to say to Abraham his father: “My father!” In turn he said: “Here I am, my son!” So he continued: “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">To this Abraham said: “God will provide himself the sheep for the burnt offering, my son.” And both of them walked on together.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Finally they reached the place that the [true] God had designated to him, and Abraham built an altar there and set the wood in order and bound Isaac his son hand and foot and put him upon the altar on top of the wood.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Abraham put out his hand and took the slaughtering knife to kill his son.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But Jehovah’s angel began calling to him out of the heavens and saying: “Abraham, Abraham!” to which he answered: “Here I am!”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went on to say: “Do not put out your hand against the boy and do not do anything at all to him, for now I do know that you are God-fearing in that you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At that Abraham raised his eyes and looked and there, deep in the foreground, there was a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering in place of his son.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Abraham began to call the name of that place Je&middot;ho&acute;vah-ji&acute;reh. This is why it is customarily said today: “In the mountain of Jehovah it will be provided.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Jehovah’s angel proceeded to call to Abraham the second time out of the heavens</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and to say: “‘By myself I do swear,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘that by reason of the fact that you have done this thing and you have not withheld your son, your only one,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">I shall surely bless you and I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore; and your seed will take possession of the gate of his enemies.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves due to the fact that you have listened to my voice.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">After that Abraham returned to his attendants, and they got up and went their way together to Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba; and Abraham continued to dwell at Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now it came about after these things that the report got through to Abraham: “Here Mil&acute;cah herself has also borne sons to Na&acute;hor your brother:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kem&middot;u&acute;el the father of A&acute;ram,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">and Che&acute;sed and Ha&acute;zo and Pil&acute;dash and Jid&acute;laph and Be&middot;thu&acute;el.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And Be&middot;thu&acute;el became the father of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah. These eight Mil&acute;cah bore to Na&acute;hor the brother of Abraham.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">There was his concubine too, whose name was Reu&acute;mah. In time she herself also gave birth to Te&acute;bah and Ga&acute;ham and Ta&acute;hash and Ma&acute;a&middot;cah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Sarah’s life got to be a hundred and twenty-seven years long. They were the years of Sarah’s life.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So Sarah died in Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-ar&acute;ba, that is to say, He&acute;bron, in the land of Ca&acute;naan, and Abraham came in to bewail Sarah and to weep over her.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Abraham got up from before his dead and proceeded to speak to the sons of Heth, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“An alien resident and settler I am among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Give me the possession of a burial place among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Hear us, my lord. A chieftain of God you are in the midst of us. In the choicest of our burial places bury your dead. None of us will hold back his burial place from you to prevent burying your dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Thereupon Abraham got up and bowed down to the natives, to the sons of Heth,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and spoke with them, saying: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls agree to bury my dead out of my sight, listen to me and urge E&acute;phron the son of Zo&acute;har for me,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">that he may give me the cave of Mach&middot;pe&acute;lah, which is his, which is at the extremity of his field. For the full amount of silver let him give it to me in the midst of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for the possession of a burial place.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">As it was, E&acute;phron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So E&acute;phron the Hit&acute;tite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth with all those entering the gate of his city, saying:</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“No, my lord! Listen to me. The field I do give to you, and the cave that is in it to you I do give it. Before the eyes of the sons of my people I do give it to you. Bury your dead.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that Abraham bowed down before the natives</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and spoke to E&acute;phron in the hearing of the natives, saying: “Only if you—no, listen to me! I will give you the amount of silver for the field. Take it from me, that I may bury my dead there.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then E&acute;phron answered Abraham, saying to him:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“My lord, listen to me. A land plot worth four hundred silver shekels, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly Abraham listened to E&acute;phron, and Abraham weighed out to E&acute;phron the amount of silver that he had spoken in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred silver shekels current with the merchants.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Thus the field of E&acute;phron that was in Mach&middot;pe&acute;lah, which is in front of Mam&acute;re, the field and the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, which were within all its boundaries round about, became confirmed</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">to Abraham as his purchased property before the eyes of the sons of Heth among all those entering the gate of his city.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And after that Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Mach&middot;pe&acute;lah in front of Mam&acute;re, that is to say, He&acute;bron, in the land of Ca&acute;naan.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

<p class="title">Genesis 24:1-67</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="67">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Abraham was old, advanced in years; and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in everything.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Hence Abraham said to his servant, the oldest one of his household, who was managing all he had: “Put your hand, please, under my thigh,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">as I must have you swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites in among whom I am dwelling,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and you will certainly take a wife for my son, for Isaac.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">However, the servant said to him: “What if the woman does not wish to come with me to this land? Must I be sure to return your son to the land from where you went out?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At this Abraham said to him: “Be on your guard that you do not return my son there.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my relatives and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your seed I am going to give this land,’ he will send his angel ahead of you, and you will certainly take a wife for my son from there.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But if the woman should not wish to come with you, you also will have become free from this oath you gave me. Only you must not return my son there.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">With that the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and proceeded to go with every sort of good thing of his master’s in his hand. Then he rose and got on his way to Mes&middot;o&middot;po&middot;ta&acute;mi&middot;a to the city of Na&acute;hor.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Eventually he had the camels kneel down outside the city at a well of water about evening time, about the time that the women who draw water were accustomed to go out.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went on to say: “Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, cause it to happen, please, before me this day and perform loving-kindness with my master Abraham.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Here I am stationed at a fountain of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">What must occur is that the young woman to whom I shall say, ‘Let your water jar down, please, that I may take a drink,’ and who will indeed say, ‘Take a drink, and I shall also water your camels,’ this is the one you must assign to your servant, to Isaac; and by this let me know that you have performed loyal love with my master.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Well, it came about that before he had finished speaking, why, here coming out was Re&middot;bek&acute;ah, who had been born to Be&middot;thu&acute;el the son of Mil&acute;cah the wife of Na&acute;hor, Abraham’s brother, and her water jar was upon her shoulder.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now the young woman was very attractive in appearance, a virgin, and no man had had sexual intercourse with her; and she made her way down to the fountain and began to fill her water jar and then came up.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At once the servant ran to meet her and said: “Give me, please, a little sip of water from your jar.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In turn she said: “Drink, my lord.” With that she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When she was finished giving him a drink, then she said: “For your camels too I shall draw water until they are done drinking.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So she quickly emptied her jar into the drinking trough and ran yet again and again to the well to draw water, and kept drawing for all his camels.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">All the while the man was gazing at her in wonder, keeping silent to know whether Jehovah had made his trip successful or not.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Consequently it came about that, when the camels had finished drinking, then the man took a gold nose ring of a half shekel in weight and two bracelets for her hands, ten shekels of gold was their weight,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and he went on to say: “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please. Is there any room at the house of your father for us to spend the night?”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At that she said to him: “I am the daughter of Be&middot;thu&acute;el the son of Mil&acute;cah, whom she bore to Na&acute;hor.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And she said further to him: “There is both straw and much fodder with us, also a place to spend the night.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the man proceeded to bow down and prostrate himself before Jehovah</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and say: “Blessed be Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who has not left his loving-kindness and his trustworthiness toward my master. I being on the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of the brothers of my master.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the young woman went running and telling the household of her mother about these things.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Now Re&middot;bek&acute;ah had a brother and his name was La&acute;ban. So La&acute;ban went running to the man who was outside at the fountain.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And it came about that on seeing the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his sister and on hearing the words of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah his sister, saying: “This is the way the man spoke to me,” then he came to the man and there he was, standing by the camels at the fountain.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At once he said: “Come, you blessed one of Jehovah. Why do you keep standing out here, when I myself have made the house ready and room for the camels?”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">With that the man came on into the house, and he went unharnessing the camels and giving straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then something to eat was set before him, but he said: “I shall not eat until I have spoken about my matters.” Hence he said: “Speak!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Then he went on to say: “I am Abraham’s servant.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And Jehovah has blessed my master very much in that he goes on making him greater and giving him sheep and cattle and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Further, Sarah the wife of my master bore a son to my master after her growing old; and he will give him everything he has.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">So my master made me swear, saying, ‘You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites in whose land I am dwelling.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">No, but you will go to the house of my father and to my family and you must take a wife for my son.’</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">But I said to my master, ‘What if the woman will not come with me?’</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Then he said to me, ‘Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and will certainly give success to your way; and you must take a wife for my son from my family and from the house of my father.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">At that time you will be cleared of obligation to me by oath when you get to my family, and if they will not give her to you, then you shall become free of obligation to me by oath.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“When I got to the fountain today, then I said, ‘Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, if you are really giving success to my way on which I am going,</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">here I am stationed at a fountain of water. What must occur is that the maiden coming out to draw water to whom I shall actually say: “Please, let me drink a little water from your jar,”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">and who will indeed say to me: “Both you take a drink, and I shall also draw water for your camels,” she is the woman whom Jehovah has assigned for the son of my master.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">“Before I was finished speaking in my heart, why, there was Re&middot;bek&acute;ah coming out, with her jar upon her shoulder; and she made her way down to the fountain and began to draw water. Then I said to her, ‘Give me a drink, please.’</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">So she quickly lowered her jar from off her and said, ‘Take a drink, and I shall also water your camels.’ Then I took a drink, and she also watered the camels.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">After that I asked her and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ to which she said, ‘The daughter of Be&middot;thu&acute;el the son of Na&acute;hor, whom Mil&acute;cah bore to him.’ Accordingly I put the nose ring on her nostril and the bracelets on her hands.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And I proceeded to bow down and prostrate myself before Jehovah and bless Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the true way to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And now if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are actually exercising loving-kindness and trustworthiness toward my master, tell me; but if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Then La&acute;ban and Be&middot;thu&acute;el answered and said: “From Jehovah this thing has issued. We are unable to speak bad or good to you.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">Here is Re&middot;bek&acute;ah before you. Take her and go, and let her become a wife to the son of your master, just as Jehovah has spoken.”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And it came about that when Abraham’s servant had heard their words, he at once prostrated himself on the earth before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">And the servant began to bring out articles of silver and articles of gold and garments and to give them to Re&middot;bek&acute;ah; and he gave choice things to her brother and to her mother.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">After that they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and they spent the night there and got up in the morning.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs54-2">Then he said: “S<span class="smallcaps">END</span> me off to my master.”</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">To this her brother and her mother said: “Let the young woman stay with us at least ten days. Afterward she can go.”</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">But he said to them: “Do not detain me, seeing that Jehovah has given success to my way. Send me off, that I may go to my master.”</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">So they said: “Let us call the young woman and inquire at her mouth.”</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">Then they called Re&middot;bek&acute;ah and said to her: “Will you go with this man?” In turn she said: “I am willing to go.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">At that they sent off Re&middot;bek&acute;ah their sister and her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">And they began to bless Re&middot;bek&acute;ah and say to her: “O you, our sister, may you become thousands times ten thousand, and let your seed take possession of the gate of those who hate it.”</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">After that Re&middot;bek&acute;ah and her lady attendants rose and they went riding on the camels and following the man; and the servant took Re&middot;bek&acute;ah and got on his way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">Now Isaac had come from the way that goes to Be&acute;er-la&acute;hai-roi, for he was dwelling in the land of the Neg&acute;eb.</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">And Isaac was out walking in order to meditate in the field at about the falling of evening. When he raised his eyes and looked, why, there camels were coming!</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">When Re&middot;bek&acute;ah raised her eyes, she caught sight of Isaac and she swung herself down from off the camel.</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">Then she said to the servant: “Who is that man there walking in the field to meet us?” and the servant said: “It is my master.” And she proceeded to take a headcloth and to cover herself.</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">And the servant went relating to Isaac all the things he had done.</span> <a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">After that Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother. Thus he took Re&middot;bek&acute;ah and she became his wife; and he fell in love with her, and Isaac found comfort after the loss of his mother.</span>

       <span id="vs17">And these are the years of Ish&acute;ma&middot;el’s life, a hundred and thirty-seven years. Then he expired and died and was gathered to his people.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And they took up tabernacling from Hav&acute;i&middot;lah near Shur, which is in front of Egypt, as far as As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a. In front of all his brothers he settled down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs19-2">Abraham became father to Isaac.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Isaac happened to be forty years old at his taking Re&middot;bek&acute;ah the daughter of Be&middot;thu&acute;el the Syrian of Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram, the sister of La&acute;ban the Syrian, as his wife.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Isaac kept on entreating Jehovah especially for his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah let himself be entreated for him, and Re&middot;bek&acute;ah his wife became pregnant.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the sons within her began to struggle with each other, so that she said: “If this is the way it is, just why am I alive?” With that she went to inquire of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And Jehovah proceeded to say to her: “Two nations are in your belly, and two national groups will be separated from your inward parts; and the one national group will be stronger than the other national group, and the older will serve the younger.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Gradually her days came to the full for giving birth, and, look! twins were in her belly.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then the first came out red all over like an official garment of hair; so they called his name E&acute;sau.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And after that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of E&acute;sau; so he called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old at her giving them birth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the boys got bigger, and E&acute;sau became a man knowing how to hunt, a man of the field, but Jacob a blameless man, dwelling in tents.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Isaac had love for E&acute;sau, because it meant game in his mouth, whereas Re&middot;bek&acute;ah was a lover of Jacob.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Once Jacob was boiling up some stew, when E&acute;sau came along from the field and he was tired.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So E&acute;sau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me a swallow of the red—the red there, for I am tired!” That is why his name was called E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">To this Jacob said: “Sell me, first of all, your right as firstborn!”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And E&acute;sau continued: “Here I am simply going to die, and of what benefit to me is a birthright?”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And Jacob added: “Swear to me first of all!” And he proceeded to swear to him and to sell his right as firstborn to Jacob.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And Jacob gave E&acute;sau bread and lentil stew, and he went to eating and drinking. Then he got up and went his way. So E&acute;sau despised the birthright.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 26:1-35</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="35">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now there arose a famine in the land, besides the first famine that occurred in the days of Abraham, so that Isaac directed himself to A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech, king of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, to Ge&acute;rar.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Jehovah appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt. Tabernacle in the land that I designate to you.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Reside as an alien in this land, and I shall continue with you and bless you, because to you and to your seed I shall give all these lands, and I will carry out the sworn statement that I swore to Abraham your father,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">‘And I will multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and I will give to your seed all these lands; and by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves,’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">due to the fact that Abraham listened to my voice and continued to keep his obligations to me, my commands, my statutes, and my laws.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Isaac went on dwelling at Ge&acute;rar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Well, the men of the place kept asking with respect to his wife, and he would say: “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say “My wife” for fear that, to quote him, “the men of the place should kill me because of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah,” because she was attractive in appearance.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So it came about that as his days there extended themselves A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech, king of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, was looking out of the window and taking in the sight, and there was Isaac having a good time with Re&middot;bek&acute;ah his wife.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At once A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech called Isaac and said: “Why, she is no other than your wife! So how is it that you said, ‘She is my sister’?” At this Isaac said to him: “I said it for fear I should die on her account.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech continued: “What is this you have done to us? A little more and certainly one of the people would have lain down with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us!”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech commanded all the people, saying: “Anybody touching this man and his wife will surely be put to death!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Afterward Isaac began to sow seed in that land, and in that year he was getting up to a hundred measures to one, as Jehovah was blessing him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Consequently the man became great and went on advancing more and more and growing great until he got very great.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he came to have flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants, so that the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines began to envy him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As for all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father, these the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines stopped up and they would fill them with dry earth.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Finally A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech said to Isaac: “Move from our neighborhood, because you have grown far stronger than we are.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So Isaac moved from there and encamped in the torrent valley of Ge&acute;rar and took up dwelling there.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Isaac proceeded to dig again the wells of water that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father but which the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines went stopping up after Abraham’s death; and he resumed calling their names by the names that his father had called them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the servants of Isaac went on digging in the torrent valley and so they found there a well of fresh water.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the shepherds of Ge&acute;rar fell to quarreling with the shepherds of Isaac, saying: “The water is ours!” Hence he called the name of the well E&acute;sek, because they had contended with him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they went digging another well, and they fell to quarreling over it also. Hence he called its name Sit&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it. Hence he called its name Re&middot;ho&acute;both and said: “It is because now Jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the earth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then he went up from there to Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Jehovah proceeded to appear to him during that night and to say: “I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not be afraid, because I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed on account of Abraham my servant.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Accordingly he built an altar there and called on the name of Jehovah and pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac went excavating a well there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Later on A&middot;bim&acute;e&middot;lech came to him from Ge&acute;rar with A&middot;huz&acute;zath his confidential friend and Phi&acute;col the chief of his army.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">At this Isaac said to them: “Why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come to me, seeing that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves hated me and so sent me away from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> neighborhood?”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">To this they said: “We have unmistakably seen that Jehovah has proved to be with you. Hence we said, ‘Let, please, an oath of obligation occur between us, between us and you, and let us conclude a covenant with you,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">that you will do nothing bad toward us just as we have not touched you and just as we have done only good toward you in that we sent you away in peace. You now are the blessed of Jehovah.’”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then he made a feast for them and they ate and drank.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Next morning they were early in rising and they made sworn statements one to the other. After that Isaac sent them away and they went from him in peace.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Now on that day it occurred that the servants of Isaac proceeded to come and report to him regarding the well that they had dug, and to say to him: “We have found water!”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Hence he called its name Shi&acute;bah. That is why the name of the city is Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba, down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And E&acute;sau grew to be forty years old. Then he took as wife Ju&acute;dith the daughter of Be&middot;e&acute;ri the Hit&acute;tite and also Bas&acute;e&middot;math the daughter of E&acute;lon the Hit&acute;tite.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And they were a source of bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Re&middot;bek&acute;ah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now it came about that when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see he then called E&acute;sau his older son and said to him: “My son!” at which he said to him: “Here I am!”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he went on to say: “Here, now, I have become old. I do not know the day of my death.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So at this time take, please, your implements, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt some venison for me.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then make me a tasty dish such as I am fond of and bring it to me and, ah, let me eat, in order that my soul may bless you before I die.”</span>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jacob proceeded to say to Re&middot;bek&acute;ah his mother: “But E&acute;sau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">What if my father feels me? Then I shall certainly become in his eyes like one making a mockery, and I shall certainly bring upon myself a malediction and not a blessing.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At this his mother said to him: “Upon me be the malediction meant for you, my son. Only listen to my voice and go, get them for me.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Accordingly he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty dish such as his father was fond of.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that Re&middot;bek&acute;ah took garments of E&acute;sau her older son, the most desirable ones which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the skins of the kids of the goats she put upon his hands and upon the hairless part of his neck.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then she gave the tasty dish and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob her son.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So he went on in to his father and said: “My father!” to which he said: “Here I am! Who are you, my son?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Jacob went on to say to his father: “I am E&acute;sau your firstborn. I have done just as you have spoken to me. Raise yourself up, please. Sit down and eat some of my game, in order that your soul may bless me.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">At that Isaac said to his son: “How is it that you have been so quick in finding it, my son?” In turn he said: “Because Jehovah your God caused it to meet up with me.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then Isaac said to Jacob: “Come near, please, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son E&acute;sau or not.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So Jacob came near to Isaac his father, and he went feeling him, after which he said: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of E&acute;sau.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he did not recognize him, because his hands proved to be hairy like the hands of E&acute;sau his brother. Hence he blessed him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">After that he said: “You are really my son E&acute;sau?” to which he said: “I am.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then he said: “Bring it near to me that I may eat some of the game of my son, to the end that my soul may bless you.” With that he brought it near to him and he began to eat, and he brought him wine and he began to drink.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Isaac his father said to him: “Come near, please, and kiss me, my son.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So he came near and kissed him, and he could smell the scent of his garments. And he proceeded to bless him and to say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs27-2">“See, the scent of my son is like the scent of the field which Jehovah has blessed.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And may the [true] God give you the dews of the heavens and the fertile soils of the earth and an abundance of grain and new wine.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Let peoples serve you and let national groups bow low to you. Become master over your brothers, and let the sons of your mother bow low to you. Cursed be each one of those cursing you, and blessed be each one of those blessing you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Now it came about as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, yes, it indeed came about when Jacob had barely come out from before the face of Isaac his father, that E&acute;sau his brother came back from his hunting.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And he too went about making a tasty dish. Then he brought it to his father and said to his father: “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, in order that your soul may bless me.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">At this Isaac his father said to him: “Who are you?” to which he said: “I am your son, your firstborn, E&acute;sau.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And Isaac began to shake with a great trembling in extreme measure, and so he said: “Who, then, was it that hunted for game and came bringing it to me, so that I ate of everything before you could come in and I blessed him? Blessed too he will become!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">On hearing his father’s words E&acute;sau began to cry out in an extremely loud and bitter manner and to say to his father: “Bless me, even me too, my father!”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">But he went on to say: “Your brother came with deception that he might get the blessing meant for you.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">At this he said: “Is that not why his name is called Jacob, in that he should supplant me these two times? My birthright he has already taken, and here at this time he has taken my blessing!” Then he added: “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But in answer to E&acute;sau Isaac continued: “Here I have appointed him master over you, and all his brothers I have given to him as servants, and grain and new wine I have bestowed for his support, and where is there anything I can do for you, my son?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then E&acute;sau said to his father: “Is there just one blessing that you have, my father? Bless me, even me too, my father!” With that E&acute;sau raised his voice and burst into tears.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So in answer Isaac his father said to him:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs39-2">“Behold, away from the fertile soils of the earth your dwelling will be found, and away from the dew of the heavens above.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And by your sword you will live, and your brother you will serve. But it will certainly occur that, when you grow restless, you will indeed break his yoke off your neck.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">However, E&acute;sau harbored animosity for Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and E&acute;sau kept saying in his heart: “The days of the period of mourning for my father are getting closer. After that I am going to kill Jacob my brother.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">When the words of E&acute;sau her older son were told to Re&middot;bek&acute;ah, she at once sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him: “Look! E&acute;sau your brother is comforting himself in regard to you—to kill you.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Now, then, my son, listen to my voice and get up, run away to La&acute;ban my brother at Ha&acute;ran.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And you must dwell with him for some days until the rage of your brother calms down,</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">until the anger of your brother turns away from you and he has forgotten what you have done to him. And I shall certainly send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of both of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in one day?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">After that Re&middot;bek&acute;ah kept saying to Isaac: “I have come to abhor this life of mine because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these from the daughters of the land, of what good is life to me?”</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="22">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Consequently Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him and said to him: “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Ca&acute;naan.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Get up, go to Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram to the house of Be&middot;thu&acute;el the father of your mother and from there take yourself a wife from the daughters of La&acute;ban the brother of your mother.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he will give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, that you may take possession of the land of your alien residences, which God has given to Abraham.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he struck out for Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram, for La&acute;ban the son of Be&middot;thu&acute;el the Syrian, the brother of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah, mother of Jacob and E&acute;sau.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">When E&acute;sau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram to take from there a wife for himself, and that when he blessed him he laid the command upon him, saying: “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Ca&acute;naan”;</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and that Jacob was obeying his father and his mother and was on his way to Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">then E&acute;sau saw that the daughters of Ca&acute;naan were displeasing in the eyes of Isaac his father.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Hence E&acute;sau went to Ish&acute;ma&middot;el and took as wife Ma&acute;ha&middot;lath the daughter of Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Abraham, the sister of Ne&middot;ba&acute;ioth, besides his other wives.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Jacob continued on his way out from Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba and kept going to Ha&acute;ran.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In time he came across a place and set about spending the night there because the sun had set. So he took one of the stones of the place and set it as his head supporter and lay down in that place.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he began to dream, and, look! there was a ladder stationed upon the earth and its top reaching up to the heavens; and, look! there were God’s angels ascending and descending on it.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And, look! there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he proceeded to say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs13-2">“I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land upon which you are lying, to you I am going to give it and to your seed.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And your seed will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, and you will certainly spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by means of you and by means of your seed all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And here I am with you and I will keep you in all the way you are going and I will return you to this ground, because I am not going to leave you until I have actually done what I have spoken to you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said: “Truly Jehovah is in this place and I myself did not know it.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he grew fearful and added: “How fear-inspiring this place is! This is nothing else but the house of God and this is the gate of the heavens.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So Jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone that was there as his head supporter and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Further, he called the name of that place Beth&acute;el; but the fact is, Luz was the city’s name formerly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jacob went on to vow a vow, saying: “If God will continue with me and will certainly keep me on this way on which I am going and will certainly give me bread to eat and garments to wear</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and I shall certainly return in peace to the house of my father, then Jehovah will have proved to be my God.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God, and as for everything that you will give me I shall without fail give the tenth of it to you.”</span>

       <span id="vs6">At this he said to them: “Is it all right with him?” In turn they said: “It is all right. And here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep!”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he went on to say: “Why, it is yet full day. It is not the time for gathering the herds. W<span class="smallcaps">ATER</span> the sheep, then go feed them.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">To this they said: “We are not allowed to do so until all the droves are gathered and they actually roll away the stone from off the mouth of the well. Then we must water the sheep.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep that belonged to her father, for she was a shepherdess.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And it came about that when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of La&acute;ban his mother’s brother and the sheep of La&acute;ban his mother’s brother, Jacob immediately approached and rolled away the stone from off the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of La&acute;ban his mother’s brother.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and raised his voice and burst into tears.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jacob began to tell Rachel that he was the brother of her father and that he was the son of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah. And she went running and telling her father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now it came about that as soon as La&acute;ban heard the report about Jacob the son of his sister, he went running to meet him. Then he embraced him and kissed him and brought him on into his house. And he began to relate to La&acute;ban all these things.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">After that La&acute;ban said to him: “You are indeed my bone and my flesh.” So he dwelt with him a full month.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that La&acute;ban said to Jacob: “Are you my brother, and must you serve me for nothing? Tell me, What are your wages to be?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">As it was, La&acute;ban had two daughters. The name of the older was Le&acute;ah and the name of the younger Rachel.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But the eyes of Le&acute;ah had no luster, whereas Rachel had become beautiful in form and beautiful of countenance.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jacob was in love with Rachel. So he said: “I am willing to serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">To this La&acute;ban said: “It is better for me to give her to you than for me to give her to another man. Keep dwelling with me.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jacob proceeded to serve seven years for Rachel, but in his eyes they proved to be like some few days because of his love for her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then Jacob said to La&acute;ban: “Give over my wife, because my days are up, and let me have relations with her.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">With that La&acute;ban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But it turned out that during the evening he resorted to taking Le&acute;ah his daughter and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Moreover, La&acute;ban gave to her Zil&acute;pah his maidservant, even to Le&acute;ah his daughter, as a maidservant.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So it followed in the morning that here it was Le&acute;ah! Consequently he said to La&acute;ban: “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? So why have you tricked me?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">To this La&acute;ban said: “It is not customary to do this way in our place, to give the younger woman before the firstborn.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Celebrate to the full the week of this woman. After that there shall be given to you also this other woman for the service that you can serve with me for seven years more.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Accordingly Jacob did so and celebrated fully the week of this woman, after which he gave him Rachel his daughter as his wife.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Besides, La&acute;ban gave Bil&acute;hah his maidservant to Rachel his daughter as her maidservant.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then he had relations also with Rachel and also expressed more love for Rachel than for Le&acute;ah, and he went serving with him for yet seven years more.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">When Jehovah came to see that Le&acute;ah was hated, he then opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Le&acute;ah became pregnant and brought a son to birth and then called his name Reu&acute;ben, for she said: “It is because Jehovah has looked upon my wretchedness, in that now my husband will begin to love me.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And she became pregnant again and brought a son to birth and then said: “It is because Jehovah has listened, in that I was hated and so he gave me also this one.” Hence she called his name Sim&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And she became pregnant yet again and brought a son to birth and then said: “Now this time my husband will join himself to me, because I have borne him three sons.” His name was therefore called Le&acute;vi.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And she became pregnant once more and brought a son to birth and then said: “This time I shall laud Jehovah.” She therefore called his name Judah. After that she left off giving birth.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="43">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">When Rachel came to see that she had borne nothing to Jacob, Rachel got jealous of her sister and began to say to Jacob: “Give me children or otherwise I shall be a dead woman.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At this Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel and he said: “Am I in the place of God, who has held back the fruit of the belly from you?”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So she said: “Here is my slave girl Bil&acute;hah. Have relations with her, that she may give birth upon my knees and that I, even I, may get children from her.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">With that she gave him Bil&acute;hah her maidservant as wife, and Jacob had relations with her.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Bil&acute;hah became pregnant and in time bore Jacob a son.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Rachel said: “God has acted as my judge and has also listened to my voice, so that he gave me a son.” That is why she called his name Dan.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Bil&acute;hah, Rachel’s maidservant, became pregnant once more and in time bore a second son to Jacob.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then Rachel said: “With strenuous wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. I have also come off winner!” So she called his name Naph&acute;ta&middot;li.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When Le&acute;ah came to see that she had left off giving birth, she proceeded to take Zil&acute;pah her maidservant and to give her to Jacob as wife.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In time Zil&acute;pah, Le&acute;ah’s maidservant, bore a son to Jacob.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Le&acute;ah said: “With good fortune!” So she called his name Gad.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">After that Zil&acute;pah, Le&acute;ah’s maidservant, bore a second son to Jacob.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Le&acute;ah said: “With my happiness! For the daughters will certainly pronounce me happy.” So she called his name Ash&acute;er.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now Reu&acute;ben went walking in the days of the wheat harvest and got to find mandrakes in the field. So he brought them to Le&acute;ah his mother. Then Rachel said to Le&acute;ah: “Give me, please, some of your son’s mandrakes.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this she said to her: “Is this a little thing, your having taken my husband, with your now taking also my son’s mandrakes?” So Rachel said: “For that reason he is going to lie down with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When Jacob was coming from the field in the evening, Le&acute;ah went on out to meet him and then said: “It is with me you are going to have relations, because I have hired you outright with my son’s mandrakes.” Accordingly he lay down with her that night.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And God heard and answered Le&acute;ah and she became pregnant and in time bore to Jacob a fifth son.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Le&acute;ah said: “God has given me a hireling’s wages, because I have given my maidservant to my husband.” So she called his name Is&acute;sa&middot;char.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Le&acute;ah became pregnant once more and in time bore a sixth son to Jacob.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then Le&acute;ah said: “God has endowed me, yes, me, with a good endowment. At last my husband will tolerate me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And afterward she bore a daughter and then called her name Di&acute;nah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally God remembered Rachel, and God heard and answered her in that he opened her womb.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And she became pregnant and brought a son to birth. Then she said: “God has taken away my reproach!”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So she called his name Joseph, saying: “Jehovah is adding another son to me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And it followed that when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob immediately said to La&acute;ban: “Send me away that I may go to my place and to my country.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Give over my wives and my children, for whom I have served with you, that I may go; for you yourself must know my service which I have rendered you.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then La&acute;ban said to him: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes,—I have taken the omens to the effect that Jehovah is blessing me due to you.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And he added: “Stipulate your wages to me and I shall give them.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">So he said to him: “You yourself must know how I have served you and how your herd has fared with me;</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">that it was little that you actually had before my coming, and it went expanding to a multitude, in that Jehovah blessed you since I stepped in. So now when am I to do something also for my own house?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then he said: “What shall I give you?” And Jacob went on to say: “You will give me nothing whatsoever! If you will do this thing for me, I shall resume shepherding your flock. I shall continue guarding it.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">I will pass among your whole flock today. You set aside from there every sheep speckled and with color patches, and every dark-brown sheep among the young rams and any color-patched and speckled one among the she-goats. Hereafter such must be my wages.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And my right-doing must answer for me on whatever future day you may come to look over my wages; every one that is not speckled and color-patched among the she-goats and dark brown among the young rams is something stolen if it is with me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">To this La&acute;ban said: “Why, that is fine! Let it be according to your word.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Then he set aside on that day the he-goats striped and color-patched and all the she-goats speckled and color-patched, every one in which there was any white and every one dark brown among the young rams, but he gave them over into the hands of his sons.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">After that he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was shepherding the flocks of La&acute;ban that remained over.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Then Jacob took for his use staffs still moist of the storax tree and of the almond tree and of the plane tree and peeled in them white peeled spots by laying bare white places which were upon the staffs.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Finally the staffs that he had peeled he placed in front of the flock, in the gutters, in the water drinking troughs, where the flocks would come to drink, that they might get into a heat before them when they came to drink.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Consequently the flocks would get in heat before the staffs, and the flocks would produce striped, speckled and color-patched ones.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And Jacob separated the young rams and then turned the faces of the flocks to the striped ones and all the dark-brown ones among the flocks of La&acute;ban. Then he set his own droves by themselves and did not set them by the flocks of La&acute;ban.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And it always occurred that whenever the robust flocks would get in heat, Jacob would locate the staffs in the gutters before the eyes of the flocks, that they might get in heat by the staffs.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">But when the flocks showed feebleness he would not locate them there. So the feeble ones always came to be La&acute;ban’s, but the robust ones Jacob’s.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And the man went on increasing more and more, and great flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses came to be his.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 31:1-55</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="55">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In time he got to hear the words of the sons of La&acute;ban, saying: “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father; and from what belonged to our father he has amassed all this wealth.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">When Jacob would look at the face of La&acute;ban, here it was not with him as formerly.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Finally Jehovah said to Jacob: “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I shall continue with you.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Jacob sent and called Rachel and Le&acute;ah out to the field to his flock,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and he said to them:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs5-2">“I am seeing the face of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father, that he is not the same toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has proved to be with me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves certainly know that with all my power I have served <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father has trifled with me and he has changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to do me harm.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">If on the one hand he would say, ‘The speckled ones will become your wages,’ then the whole flock produced speckled ones; but if on the other hand he would say, ‘The striped ones will become your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped ones.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So God kept taking the herd of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father away and giving it to me.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">At last it came about at the time when the flock got in heat that I raised my eyes and saw a sight in a dream and here the he-goats springing upon the flock were striped, speckled and spotty.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then the angel of the [true] God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ to which I said, ‘Here I am.’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he continued, ‘Raise your eyes, please, and see all the he-goats springing upon the flock are striped, speckled and spotty, for I have seen all that La&acute;ban is doing to you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">I am the [true] God of Beth&acute;el, where you anointed a pillar and where you vowed a vow to me. Now get up, go out of this land and return to the land of your birth.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At this Rachel and Le&acute;ah answered and said to him: “Is there a share of inheritance for us anymore in the house of our father?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Are we not really considered as foreigners to him since he has sold us, so that he keeps eating continually even from the money given for us?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For all the riches that God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. So now everything God has said to you do.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then Jacob got up and lifted his children and his wives onto the camels;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and he began driving all his herd and all the goods that he had accumulated, the herd of his acquisition that he had accumulated in Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram, in order to go to Isaac his father to the land of Ca&acute;naan.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now La&acute;ban had gone to shear his sheep. Meantime Rachel stole the teraphim that belonged to her father.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Jacob outwitted La&acute;ban the Syrian, because he had not told him that he was running away.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he proceeded to run away and to get up and cross the River, he and all he had. After that he directed his face to the mountainous region of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later, on the third day, it was told to La&acute;ban that Jacob had run away.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">With that he took his brothers with him and went chasing after him for a distance of seven days’ journey and caught up with him in the mountainous region of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then God came to La&acute;ban the Syrian in a dream by night and said to him: “Watch yourself that you do not go speaking either good or bad with Jacob.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So La&acute;ban approached Jacob, as Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and La&acute;ban had encamped his brothers in the mountainous region of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then La&acute;ban said to Jacob: “What have you done, in that you resorted to outwitting me and driving my daughters off like captives taken by the sword?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Why did you have to run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me, that I might send you away with rejoicing and with songs, with tambourine and with harp?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And you did not give me a chance to kiss my children and my daughters. Now you have acted foolishly.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">It is in the power of my hand to do harm to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, but the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father talked to me last night, saying, ‘Watch yourself against speaking either good or bad with Jacob.’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">While you have actually gone now because you have been yearning intensely for the house of your father, why, though, have you stolen my gods?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In answer Jacob proceeded to say to La&acute;ban: “It was because I was afraid. For I said to myself, ‘You might tear your daughters away from me.’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Whoever it is with whom you may find your gods, let him not live. Before our brothers, examine for yourself what is with me and take them for yourself.” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So La&acute;ban went on into the tent of Jacob and into the tent of Le&acute;ah and into the tent of the two slave girls, but did not find them. Finally he went out of Le&acute;ah’s tent and went on into Rachel’s tent.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and she resorted to putting them in the woman’s saddle basket of the camel, and she kept sitting upon them. So La&acute;ban went feeling through the whole tent, but did not find them.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Then she said to her father: “Do not let anger gleam in the eyes of my lord, because I am not able to get up before you, for the customary thing with women is upon me.” So he searched on carefully, but did not find the teraphim.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And Jacob became angry and began to quarrel with La&acute;ban, and in answer Jacob went on to say to La&acute;ban: “What is the revolt on my part, what the sin of mine, as a reason why you have hotly pursued after me?</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Now that you have felt through all my goods, what of all the goods of your house have you found? Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between us two.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">These twenty years I have been with you. Your female sheep and your she-goats did not suffer abortions, and the rams of your flock I never ate.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Any animal torn to pieces I did not bring to you. I myself would stand the loss of it. Whether one was stolen by day or was stolen by night, you would put in a claim for it from my hand.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">It has been my experience that by day the heat consumed me and the cold by night, and my sleep would flee from my eyes.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">This makes twenty years for me in your house. I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had not proved on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. My wretchedness and the toil of my hands God has seen, and so he reproved you last night.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Then La&acute;ban in answer said to Jacob: “The daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock, and everything you are looking at is mine and my daughters’. What can I do against these today or against their children whom they have borne?</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And now, come, let us conclude a covenant, I and you, and it must serve as a witness between me and you.”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Accordingly Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!” And they went taking stones and making a heap. After that they ate there on the heap.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And La&acute;ban began calling it Je&acute;gar-sa&middot;ha&middot;du&acute;tha, but Jacob called it Gal&acute;e&middot;ed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And La&acute;ban proceeded to say: “This heap is a witness between me and you today.” That is why he called its name Gal&acute;e&middot;ed,</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">and The Watchtower, because he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen the one from the other.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">If you go to afflicting my daughters and if you go to taking wives in addition to my daughters, there is no man with us. See! God is a witness between me and you.”</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">And La&acute;ban went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this heap and here is the pillar that I have erected between me and you.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">This heap is a witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, that I will not pass this heap against you and that you will not pass this heap and this pillar against me for harm.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Let the god of Abraham and the god of Na&acute;hor judge between us, the god of their father.” But Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">After that Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread. Accordingly they ate bread and passed the night in the mountain.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">However, La&acute;ban got up early in the morning and kissed his children and his daughters and blessed them. Then La&acute;ban got on his way that he might return to his own place.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And as for Jacob, he got on his way, and the angels of God now met up with him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Immediately Jacob said, when he saw them: “The camp of God this is!” Hence he called the name of that place Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&acute;im.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to E&acute;sau his brother to the land of Se&acute;ir, the field of E&acute;dom,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and he commanded them, saying: “This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say to my lord, to E&acute;sau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob has said: “With La&acute;ban I have resided as an alien and I have stayed for a long time till now.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I have come to have bulls and asses, sheep, and menservants and maidservants, and I would like to send to notify my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In time the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: “We got to your brother E&acute;sau, and he is also on his way to meet you, and four hundred men with him.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Jacob became very much afraid and grew anxious. So he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the cattle and the camels into two camps,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and he said: “If E&acute;sau should come to the one camp and assault it, then there is certain to be a camp remaining to make an escape.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that Jacob said: “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you who are saying to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will deal well with you,’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">I am unworthy of all the loving-kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have exercised toward your servant, for with but my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Deliver me, I pray you, from my brother’s hand, from E&acute;sau’s hand, because I am afraid of him that he may come and certainly assault me, mother together with children.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And you, you have said, ‘Unquestionably I shall deal well with you and I will constitute your seed like the grains of sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he kept lodging there on that night. And from what came to his hand he proceeded to take a gift for E&acute;sau his brother:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty rams,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">thirty camels giving suck and their young ones, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten full-grown asses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then he handed over to his servants one drove after another by itself and repeatedly said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to set an interval between drove and drove.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Further he commanded the first one, saying: “In case that E&acute;sau my brother should meet you and ask you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">then you must say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob. A gift it is, sent to my lord, to E&acute;sau, and look! he himself is also behind us.’”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he went on to command also the second, also the third, also all those following the droves, saying: “According to this word <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to speak to E&acute;sau on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> encountering him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say also, ‘Here is your servant Jacob behind us.’” For he said to himself: “I may appease him by the gift going ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will give a kindly reception.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the gift went crossing over ahead of him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later during that night he rose and took his two wives and his two maidservants and his eleven young sons and crossed over the ford of Jab&acute;bok.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So he took them and brought them over the torrent valley, and he brought over what he had.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to grapple with him until the dawn ascended.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">When he got to see that he had not prevailed over him, then he touched the socket of his thigh joint; and the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint got out of place during his grappling with him.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn has ascended.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you first bless me.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then he said: “Your name will no longer be called Jacob but Israel, for you have contended with God and with men so that you at last prevailed.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In turn Jacob inquired and said: “Tell me, please, your name.” However, he said: “Why is it that you inquire for my name?” With that he blessed him there.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Hence Jacob called the name of the place Pe&middot;ni&acute;el, because, to quote him, “I have seen God face to face and yet my soul was delivered.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the sun began to flash upon him as soon as he passed by Pe&middot;nu&acute;el, but he was limping upon his thigh.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">That is why the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the sinew of the thigh nerve, which is on the socket of the thigh joint, down to this day, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In time Jacob raised his eyes and looked, and here E&acute;sau was coming and with him four hundred men. Consequently he divided off the children to Le&acute;ah and to Rachel and to the two maidservants,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and he put the maidservants and their children foremost and Le&acute;ah and her children after them and Rachel and Joseph to the rear of them.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he himself passed on ahead of them and proceeded to bow down to the earth seven times until he got near to his brother.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And E&acute;sau went running to meet him, and he began to embrace him and fall upon his neck and kiss him, and they burst into tears.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children and said: “Who are these with you?” to which he said: “The children with whom God has favored your servant.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that the maidservants came forward, they and their children, and bowed down;</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and Le&acute;ah too came forward, and her children, and they bowed down, and afterward Joseph came forward, and Rachel, and they bowed down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He now said: “What do you mean by all this camp of travelers that I have met?” To this he said: “In order to find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then E&acute;sau said: “I have a great many, my brother. Let continue yours what is yours.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">However, Jacob said: “No, please. If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, then you must take my gift at my hand, because in harmony with its purpose I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face in that you received me with pleasure.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Take, please, the gift conveying my blessing which was brought to you, because God has favored me and because I have everything.” And he continued to urge him, so that he took it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Later on he said: “Let us pull out and go, and let me go in advance of you.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But he said to him: “My lord is aware that the children are delicate and sheep and cattle that are giving suck are in my charge, and should they drive them too quickly for one day, then the whole flock will certainly die.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Let my lord, please, pass on ahead of his servant, but may I myself continue the journey at my leisure according to the pace of the livestock that is before me and according to the pace of the children until I shall come to my lord at Se&acute;ir.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then E&acute;sau said: “Let me, please, put at your disposal some of the people who are with me.” To this he said: “Why this? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So on that day E&acute;sau turned back on his way to Se&acute;ir.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Jacob pulled out for Suc&acute;coth, and he proceeded to build himself a house and for his herd he made booths. That was why he called the name of the place Suc&acute;coth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In time Jacob came safe and sound to the city of She&acute;chem, which is in the land of Ca&acute;naan, while he was coming from Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram; and he pitched camp in front of the city.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then he acquired a tract of the field where he pitched his tent at the hand of the sons of Ha&acute;mor the father of She&acute;chem, for a hundred pieces of money.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">After that he set up there an altar and called it God the God of Israel.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now Di&acute;nah the daughter of Le&acute;ah, whom she had borne to Jacob, used to go out to see the daughters of the land.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And She&acute;chem the son of Ha&acute;mor the Hi&acute;vite, a chieftain of the land, got to see her and then took her and lay down with her and violated her.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And his soul began clinging to Di&acute;nah the daughter of Jacob, and he fell in love with the young woman and kept speaking persuasively to the young woman.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Finally She&acute;chem said to Ha&acute;mor his father: “Get me this young lady as a wife.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jacob heard that he had defiled Di&acute;nah his daughter. And his sons happened to be with his herd in the field; and Jacob kept silent until they should come in.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Later Ha&acute;mor, She&acute;chem’s father, went out to Jacob to speak with him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the sons of Jacob came in from the field as soon as they heard of it; and the men became hurt in their feelings and they grew very angry, because he had committed a disgraceful folly against Israel in lying down with Jacob’s daughter, whereas nothing like that ought to be done.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Ha&acute;mor proceeded to speak with them, saying: “As for She&acute;chem my son, his soul is attached to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughter. Give her, please, to him as a wife,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and form marriage alliances with us. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> daughters <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to give to us, and our daughters <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to take for yourselves.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And with us <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may dwell, and the land will become available for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Dwell and carry on business in it and get settled in it.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then She&acute;chem said to her father and to her brothers: “Let me find favor in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes, and whatever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say to me I shall give it.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Raise very high the marriage money and gift imposed upon me, and I stand willing to give according to what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may say to me; only give me the young woman as a wife.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jacob’s sons began to answer She&acute;chem and Ha&acute;mor his father with deceit and to speak so because he had defiled Di&acute;nah their sister.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they went on to say to them: “We cannot possibly do such a thing, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, because that is a reproach to us.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Only on this condition can we give consent to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become like us, by every male of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> getting circumcised.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then we shall certainly give our daughters to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters we shall take for ourselves, and we shall certainly dwell with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and become one people.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not listen to us to get circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And their words seemed good in the eyes of Ha&acute;mor and in the eyes of She&acute;chem, Ha&acute;mor’s son,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and the young man did not delay to perform the condition, because he did find delight in Jacob’s daughter and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Ha&acute;mor and She&acute;chem his son went to the gate of their city and began to speak to the men of their city, saying:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“These men are peace-loving toward us. Hence let them dwell in the land and carry on business in it, as the land is quite wide before them. Their daughters we can take as wives for ourselves and our own daughters we can give to them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Only on this condition will the men give us their consent to dwell with us so as to become one people, that every male of ours gets circumcised just the way they are circumcised.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then their possessions and their wealth and all their livestock, will they not be ours? Only let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then all those going out by the gate of his city listened to Ha&acute;mor and to She&acute;chem his son, and all the males got circumcised, all those going out by the gate of his city.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">However, it came about that on the third day, when they got to be aching, the two sons of Jacob, Sim&acute;e&middot;on and Le&acute;vi, brothers of Di&acute;nah, proceeded to take each one his sword and to go unsuspectedly to the city and to kill every male.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Ha&acute;mor and She&acute;chem his son they killed with the edge of the sword. Then they took Di&acute;nah from She&acute;chem’s house and went on out.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">The other sons of Jacob attacked the fatally wounded men and went plundering the city, because they had defiled their sister.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Their flocks and their herds and their asses and what was in the city and what was in the field they took.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And all their means of maintenance and all their little children and their wives they carried off captive, so that they plundered all that was in the houses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">At this Jacob said to Sim&acute;e&middot;on and to Le&acute;vi: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have brought ostracism upon me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, with the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites; whereas I am few in number, and they will certainly gather together against me and assault me and I must be annihilated, I and my house.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">In turn they said: “Ought anyone to treat our sister like a prostitute?”</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 35:1-29</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="29">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After that God said to Jacob: “Rise, go up to Beth&acute;el and dwell there, and make an altar there to the [true] God who appeared to you when you were running away from E&acute;sau your brother.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: “Put away the foreign gods that are in the midst of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and cleanse yourselves and change <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mantles,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and let us rise and go up to Beth&acute;el. And there I shall make an altar to the [true] God who answered me in the day of my distress in that he proved to be with me in the way that I have gone.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their hands and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the big tree that was close by She&acute;chem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">After that they pulled away, and the terror of God came to be upon the cities that were round about them, so that they did not chase after the sons of Jacob.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Eventually Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Ca&acute;naan, that is to say, Beth&acute;el, he and all the people who were with him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then he built an altar there and began to call the place El-beth&acute;el, because there the [true] God had revealed himself to him at the time of his running away from his brother.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Later Deb&acute;o&middot;rah the nursing woman of Re&middot;bek&acute;ah died and was buried at the foot of Beth&acute;el under a massive tree. Hence he called its name Al&acute;lon-bac&acute;uth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">God now appeared to Jacob once again during his coming from Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram and blessed him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And God went on to say to him: “Your name is Jacob. No longer is your name to be called Jacob, but Israel will your name become.” And he began to call his name Israel.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And God said further to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a congregation of nations will proceed out of you, and kings will come out of your loins.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I shall give it, and to your seed after you I shall give the land.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After that God went up from above him at the place where he had spoken with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Consequently Jacob stationed a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering upon it and poured oil upon it.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Jacob continued to call the name of the place where God had spoken with him Beth&acute;el.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then they pulled away from Beth&acute;el. And while there was yet a good stretch of land before coming to Eph&acute;rath, Rachel proceeded to give birth, and it was going hard with her in making the delivery.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But so it was that while she had difficulty in making the delivery the midwife said to her: “Do not be afraid, for you will have this son also.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the result was that as her soul was going out (because she died) she called his name Ben-o&acute;ni; but his father called him Benjamin.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Thus Rachel died and was buried on the way to Eph&acute;rath, that is to say, Beth&acute;le&middot;hem.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Hence Jacob stationed a pillar over her grave. This is the pillar of Rachel’s grave down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of E&acute;der.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And it came about while Israel was tabernacling in that land that once Reu&acute;ben went and lay down with Bil&acute;hah his father’s concubine, and Israel got to hear of it.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs22-2">So there came to be twelve sons of Jacob.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">The sons by Le&acute;ah were Jacob’s firstborn Reu&acute;ben and Sim&acute;e&middot;on and Le&acute;vi and Judah and Is&acute;sa&middot;char and Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the sons by Bil&acute;hah, Rachel’s maidservant, were Dan and Naph&acute;ta&middot;li.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the sons by Zil&acute;pah, Le&acute;ah’s maidservant, were Gad and Ash&acute;er. These are Jacob’s sons who were born to him in Pad&acute;dan-a&acute;ram.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">At length Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mam&acute;re, to Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-ar&acute;ba, that is to say, He&acute;bron, where Abraham and also Isaac had resided as aliens.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the days of Isaac came to be a hundred and eighty years.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">After that Isaac expired and died and was gathered to his people, old and satisfied with days, and E&acute;sau and Jacob his sons buried him.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 37:1-36</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="36">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Jacob continued to dwell in the land of the alien residences of his father, in the land of Ca&acute;naan.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This is the history of Jacob.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">Joseph, when seventeen years old, happened to be tending sheep with his brothers among the flock, and, being but a boy, he was with the sons of Bil&acute;hah and the sons of Zil&acute;pah, the wives of his father. So Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he had a long, striped shirtlike garment made for him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When his brothers came to see that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they began to hate him, and they were not able to speak peacefully to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later on Joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they found further reason to hate him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he went on to say to them: “Listen, please, to this dream that I have dreamed.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Well, here we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field when here my sheaf got up and also stood erect and here <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sheaves proceeded to encircle and bow down to my sheaf.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And his brothers began to say to him: “Are you going to be king over us for certain? or, Are you going to dominate over us for certain?” So they found fresh reason to hate him over his dreams and over his words.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that he had still another dream, and he related it to his brothers and said: “Here I have had a dream once more, and here the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then he related it to his father as well as his brothers, and his father began to rebuke him and say to him: “What does this dream that you have dreamed mean? Am I and also your mother and your brothers for certain going to come and bow down to the earth to you?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And his brothers grew jealous of him, but his father observed the saying.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">His brothers now went to feed the flock of their father close by She&acute;chem.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After a while Israel said to Joseph: “Your brothers are tending [flocks] close by She&acute;chem, are they not? Come, and let me send you to them.” At this he said to him: “Here I am!”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So he said to him: “Go, please. See whether your brothers are safe and sound and whether the flock is safe and sound, and bring me back word.” With that he sent him away from the low plain of He&acute;bron, and he went on toward She&acute;chem.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Later a man found him and here he was wandering in a field. Then the man inquired of him, saying: “What are you looking for?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">To this he said: “It is my brothers I am looking for. Tell me, please, Where are they tending flocks?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the man continued: “They have pulled away from here, because I heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Do&acute;than.’” So Joseph kept on after his brothers and found them at Do&acute;than.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Well, they caught sight of him from a distance, and before he could get close by them they began plotting cunningly against him to put him to death.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So they said to one another: “Look! Here comes that dreamer.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And now come and let us kill him and pitch him into one of the waterpits; and we must say a vicious wild beast devoured him. Then let us see what will become of his dreams.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When Reu&acute;ben heard this he tried to deliver him out of their hand. So he said: “Let us not strike his soul fatally.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Reu&acute;ben went on to say to them: “Do not spill blood. Pitch him into this waterpit which is in the wilderness and do not lay a violent hand upon him.” His purpose was to deliver him out of their hand in order to return him to his father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So it came about that as soon as Joseph came to his brothers, they went stripping Joseph of his long garment, even the long striped garment that was upon him;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">after which they took him and pitched him into the waterpit. At the time the pit was empty; there was no water in it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then they sat down to eat bread. When they raised their eyes and took a look, why, here was a caravan of Ish&acute;ma&middot;el&middot;ites that was coming from Gil&acute;e&middot;ad, and their camels were carrying labdanum and balsam and resinous bark, on their way to take it down to Egypt.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">At this Judah said to his brothers: “What profit would there be in case we killed our brother and did cover over his blood?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Come and let us sell him to the Ish&acute;ma&middot;el&middot;ites, and do not let our hand be upon him. After all, he is our brother, our flesh.” So they listened to their brother.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Now men, Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ite merchants, went passing by. Hence they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the waterpit and then sold Joseph to the Ish&acute;ma&middot;el&middot;ites for twenty silver pieces. Eventually these brought Joseph into Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Later Reu&acute;ben returned to the waterpit and here Joseph was not in the waterpit. Consequently he ripped his garments apart.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">When he returned to his other brothers he exclaimed: “The child is gone! And I—where am I really to go?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">However, they took Joseph’s long garment and slaughtered a male goat and repeatedly dipped the long garment in the blood.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">After that they sent the long striped garment and had it brought to their father and said: “This is what we found. Examine, please, whether it is your son’s long garment or not.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And he went examining it and exclaimed: “It is my son’s long garment! A vicious wild beast must have devoured him! Joseph is surely torn to pieces!”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">With that Jacob ripped his mantles apart and put sackcloth upon his hips and carried on mourning over his son for many days.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And all his sons and all his daughters kept rising up to comfort him, but he kept refusing to take comfort and saying: “For I shall go down mourning to my son into She&acute;ol!” And his father continued weeping for him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">However, the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ites sold him into Egypt to Pot&acute;i&middot;phar a court official of Phar&acute;aoh, the chief of the bodyguard.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now in the meantime it came about that when Judah went down from his brothers he pitched [his tent] near a man, an A&middot;dul&acute;lam&middot;ite, and his name was Hi&acute;rah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And there Judah got to see a daughter of a certain Ca&acute;naan&middot;ite, and his name was Shu&acute;a. So he took her and had relations with her.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And she became pregnant. Later she bore a son and he called his name Er.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Again she became pregnant. In time she bore a son and called his name O&acute;nan.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Yet another time she went on to bear a son and then called his name She&acute;lah. Now he happened to be in Ach&acute;zib at the time she bore him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In time Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Ta&acute;mar.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But Er, Judah’s firstborn, proved to be bad in the eyes of Jehovah; hence Jehovah put him to death.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In view of that Judah said to O&acute;nan: “Have relations with your brother’s wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her and raise up offspring for your brother.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But O&acute;nan knew that the offspring would not become his; and it occurred that when he did have relations with his brother’s wife he wasted his semen on the earth so as not to give offspring to his brother.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now what he did was bad in the eyes of Jehovah; hence he put him also to death.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So Judah said to Ta&acute;mar his daughter-in-law: “Dwell as a widow in the house of your father until She&acute;lah my son grows up.” For he said to himself: “He too may die like his brothers.” Accordingly Ta&acute;mar went and continued to dwell at her own father’s house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Thus the days became many and the daughter of Shu&acute;a, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah kept the period of mourning. After that he went up to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hi&acute;rah his companion the A&middot;dul&acute;lam&middot;ite, to Tim&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then it was told to Ta&acute;mar: “Here your father-in-law is going up to Tim&acute;nah to shear his sheep.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">With that she removed the garments of her widowhood from her and covered herself with a shawl and veiled herself and sat down at the entrance of E&middot;na&acute;im, which is along the road to Tim&acute;nah. For she saw that She&acute;lah had grown up and yet she had not been given as a wife to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When Judah caught sight of her, he at once took her for a harlot, because she had covered her face.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So he turned aside to her by the road and said: “Allow me, please, to have relations with you.” For he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. However, she said: “What will you give me that you may have relations with me?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">To this he said: “I myself shall send a kid of the goats from the herd.” But she said: “Will you give a security until you send it?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And he continued: “What is the security that I shall give you?” to which she said: “Your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand.” Then he gave them to her and had relations with her, so that she became pregnant by him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">After that she got up and went and removed her shawl off her and clothed herself with the garments of her widowhood.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Judah proceeded to send the kid of the goats by the hand of his companion the A&middot;dul&acute;lam&middot;ite in order to get back the security from the hand of the woman, but he never found her.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he went inquiring of the men of her place, saying: “Where is that temple prostitute in E&middot;na&acute;im along the road?” But they kept saying: “No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally he returned to Judah and said: “I never found her and, besides, the men of the place said, ‘No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.’”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So Judah said: “Let her take them for herself, in order that we may not fall into contempt. At any rate, I have sent this kid, but you—you never found her.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, about three months later it happened that it was told to Judah: “Ta&acute;mar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and here she is also pregnant by her harlotry.” At that Judah said: “B<span class="smallcaps">RING</span> her out and let her be burned.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">As she was being brought out she herself sent to her father-in-law, saying: “By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant.” And she added: “Examine, please, to whom these belong, the seal ring and the cord and the rod.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Judah examined them and said: “She is more righteous than I am, for the reason that I did not give her to She&acute;lah my son.” And he had no further intercourse with her after that.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now it developed that in the time of her giving birth, why, here there were twins in her belly.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Further, it turned out that when she was giving birth one extended his hand, and the midwife at once took and tied a scarlet piece about his hand, saying: “This one came out first.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Finally it developed that as soon as he drew back his hand, why, here his brother came out, so that she exclaimed: “What do you mean by this, that you have produced a perineal rupture for yourself?” Hence his name was called Pe&acute;rez.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And afterward his brother upon whose hand the scarlet piece was came out and his name came to be called Ze&acute;rah.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 39:1-23</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="23">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">As for Joseph, he was brought down to Egypt, and Pot&acute;i&middot;phar, a court official of Phar&acute;aoh, the chief of the bodyguard, an Egyptian, got to buy him from the hand of the Ish&acute;ma&middot;el&middot;ites who had brought him down there.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But Jehovah proved to be with Joseph, so that he turned out a successful man and came to be over the house of his master, the Egyptian.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And his master got to see that Jehovah was with him and that everything he was doing Jehovah was making turn out successful in his hand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes and waited upon him continually, so that he appointed him over his house, and all that was his he gave into his hand.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it followed that from the time he appointed him over his house and in charge of all that was his Jehovah kept blessing the house of the Egyptian due to Joseph, and Jehovah’s blessing came to be upon all that he had in the house and in the field.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Finally he left everything that was his in Joseph’s hand; and he did not know what was with him at all except the bread he was eating. Moreover, Joseph grew to be beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now after these things it came about that the wife of his master began to raise her eyes toward Joseph and say: “Lie down with me.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But he would refuse and would say to his master’s wife: “Here my master does not know what is with me in the house, and everything he has he has given into my hand.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">There is no one greater in this house than I am, and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So it turned out that as she spoke to Joseph day after day he never listened to her to lie alongside her, to continue with her.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But it happened that on this day as other days he went into the house to do his business, and there was none of the men of the house there in the house.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then she grabbed hold of him by his garment, saying: “Lie down with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and took to flight and went on outside.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So it occurred that as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand that he might flee outside,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them: “Look! He brought to us a man, a Hebrew, to make us a laughingstock. He came to me to lie down with me, but I began to cry out at the top of my voice.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it followed that as soon as he heard that I raised my voice and began crying out, he then left his garment beside me and took to flight and went on outside.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">After that she kept his garment laid up beside her until his master came to his house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying: “The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came to me to make me a laughingstock.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But it followed that as soon as I raised my voice and began to cry out, he then left his garment beside me and went fleeing outside.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">The result was that as soon as his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying: “Like this and this your servant did to me,” his anger blazed.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Joseph’s master took him and gave him over to the prison house, the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest, and he continued there in the prison house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">However, Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept extending loving-kindness to him and granting him to find favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison house.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So the chief officer of the prison house gave over into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison house; and everything that they were doing there he proved to be the one having it done.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">The chief officer of the prison house was looking after absolutely nothing that was in his hand, because Jehovah was with [Joseph] and what he was doing Jehovah was making it turn out successful.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now after these things it came about that the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their lord the king of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Phar&acute;aoh grew indignant at his two officers, at the chief of the cupbearers and at the chief of the bakers.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So he committed them to the jail of the house of the chief of the bodyguard, to the prison house, the place where Joseph was a prisoner.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then the chief of the bodyguard assigned Joseph to be with them that he might wait upon them; and they continued in jail for some days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And both of them proceeded to dream a dream, each one his own dream in the one night, each one his dream with its own interpretation, the cupbearer and the baker who belonged to the king of Egypt who were prisoners in the prison house.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">When Joseph came in to them in the morning and saw them, why, here they were looking dejected.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he began to inquire of the officers of Phar&acute;aoh who were with him in the jail of his master’s house, saying: “For what reason are <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faces gloomy today?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At this they said to him: “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter with us.” So Joseph said to them: “Do not interpretations belong to God? Relate it to me, please.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the chief of the cupbearers went on to relate his dream to Joseph and to say to him: “In my dream, why, here there was a vine before me.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And on the vine there were three twigs, and it was apparently sprouting shoots. Its blossoms pushed forth. Its clusters ripened their grapes.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Phar&acute;aoh’s cup was in my hand, and I proceeded to take the grapes and squeeze them out into Phar&acute;aoh’s cup. After that I gave the cup into Phar&acute;aoh’s hand.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then Joseph said to him: “This is its interpretation: The three twigs are three days.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In three days from now Phar&acute;aoh will lift up your head and he will certainly return you to your office; and you will certainly give Phar&acute;aoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former custom when you acted as his cupbearer.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Nevertheless, you must keep me in your remembrance as soon as it goes well with you, and you must, please, perform loving-kindness with me and mention me to Phar&acute;aoh, and you must get me out of this house.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing at all for which they should put me in the prison hole.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When the chief of the bakers saw that he had interpreted something good, he, in turn, said to Joseph: “I too was in my dream, and here there were three baskets of white bread upon my head,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and in the topmost basket there were all sorts of eatables for Phar&acute;aoh, the product of a baker, and there were fowls eating them out of the basket on top of my head.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Joseph answered and said: “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In three days from now Phar&acute;aoh will lift up your head from off you and will certainly hang you upon a stake; and the fowls will certainly eat your flesh from off you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now on the third day it turned out to be Phar&acute;aoh’s birthday, and he proceeded to make a feast for all his servants and to lift up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the midst of his servants.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Accordingly he returned the chief of the cupbearers to his post of cupbearer, and he continued to give the cup into Phar&acute;aoh’s hand.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But the chief of the bakers he hung up, just as Joseph had given them the interpretation.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">However, the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph and went on forgetting him.</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 41:1-57</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="57">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about at the end of two full years that Phar&acute;aoh was dreaming and here he was standing by the river Nile.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And here ascending out of the river Nile were seven cows beautiful in appearance and fat-fleshed, and they went feeding among the Nile grass.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And here there were seven other cows ascending after them out of the river Nile, ugly in appearance and thin-fleshed, and they took their stand alongside the cows by the bank of the river Nile.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then the cows that were ugly in appearance and thin-fleshed began to eat up the seven cows that were beautiful in appearance and fat. At this Phar&acute;aoh woke up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">However, he went back to sleep and dreamed a second time. And here there were seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, fat and good.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And here there were seven ears of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, growing up after them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven fat and full ears of grain. At this Phar&acute;aoh woke up and here it was a dream.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it developed in the morning that his spirit became agitated. So he sent and called all the magic-practicing priests of Egypt and all her wise men, and Phar&acute;aoh went on to relate his dreams to them. But there was no interpreter of them for Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Phar&acute;aoh, saying: “My sins I am mentioning today.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Phar&acute;aoh was indignant at his servants. So he committed me to the jail of the house of the chief of the bodyguard, both me and the chief of the bakers.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">After that we both dreamed a dream in the one night, both I and he. We dreamed each one his dream with its own interpretation.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, a servant of the chief of the bodyguard. When we related them to him, he proceeded to interpret our dreams to us. He interpreted to each according to his dream.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it turned out that just as he had interpreted to us so it happened. Me he returned to my office, but him he hanged.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Phar&acute;aoh proceeded to send and to call Joseph, that they might bring him quickly from the prison hole. Hence he shaved and changed his mantles and went in to Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then Phar&acute;aoh said to Joseph: “I have dreamed a dream, but there is no interpreter of it. Now I myself have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At this Joseph answered Phar&acute;aoh, saying: “I need not be considered! God will announce welfare to Phar&acute;aoh.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Phar&acute;aoh went on to speak to Joseph: “In my dream here I was standing on the bank of the river Nile.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And here ascending out of the river Nile were seven cows fat-fleshed and beautiful in form, and they began to feed among the Nile grass.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And here there were seven other cows ascending after them, poor and very bad in form and thin-fleshed. For badness I have not seen the like of them in all the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the skinny and bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So these came into their bellies, and yet it could not be known that they had come into their bellies, as their appearance was bad just as at the start. At that I woke up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“After that I saw in my dream and here there were seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, full and good.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And here there were seven ears of grain shriveled, thin, scorched by the east wind, growing up after them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven good ears of grain. So I stated it to the magic-practicing priests, but there was none telling me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then Joseph said to Phar&acute;aoh: “The dream of Phar&acute;aoh is but one. What the [true] God is doing he has told to Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">The seven good cows are seven years. Likewise the seven good ears of grain are seven years. The dream is but one.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, will prove to be seven years of famine.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">This is the thing that I have spoken to Phar&acute;aoh: What the [true] God is doing he has caused Phar&acute;aoh to see.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Here there are seven years coming with great plenty in all the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But seven years of famine will certainly arise after them, and all the plenty in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten and the famine will simply consume the land.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the plenty once in the land will not be known as a result of that famine afterward, because it will certainly be very severe.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the fact that the dream was repeated to Phar&acute;aoh twice means that the thing is firmly established on the part of the [true] God, and the [true] God is speeding to do it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“So now let Phar&acute;aoh look for a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Let Phar&acute;aoh act and appoint overseers over the land, and he must take up one fifth of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And let them collect all the foodstuffs of these coming good years, and let them pile up grain under Phar&acute;aoh’s hand as foodstuffs in the cities, and they must safeguard it.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And the foodstuffs must serve as a supply for the land for the seven famine years, which will develop in the land of Egypt, in order that the land may not be cut off by the famine.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Well, the thing proved to be good in the eyes of Phar&acute;aoh and of all his servants.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">So Phar&acute;aoh said to his servants: “Can another man be found like this one in whom the spirit of God is?”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">After that Phar&acute;aoh said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you are.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">You will personally be over my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly. Only as to the throne shall I be greater than you.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And Phar&acute;aoh added to Joseph: “See, I do place you over all the land of Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">With that Phar&acute;aoh removed his signet ring from his own hand and put it upon Joseph’s hand and clothed him with garments of fine linen and placed a necklace of gold about his neck.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Moreover, he had him ride in the second chariot of honor that he had, so that they should call out ahead of him, <i>“A&middot;vrékh!”</i> thus putting him over all the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And Phar&acute;aoh further said to Joseph: “I am Phar&acute;aoh, but without your authorization no man may lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">After that Phar&acute;aoh called Joseph’s name Zaph&acute;e&middot;nath-pa&middot;ne&acute;ah and gave him As&acute;e&middot;nath the daughter of Pot&middot;i&acute;phe&middot;ra the priest of On as a wife. And Joseph began to go out over the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs46-2">Then Joseph went out from before Phar&acute;aoh and toured about in all the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And during the seven years of plenty the land went on producing by the handfuls.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And he kept collecting all the foodstuffs of the seven years that came upon the land of Egypt and he would put the foodstuffs in the cities. The foodstuffs of the field that was round about a city he put in the midst of it.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And Joseph continued piling up grain in very great quantity, like the sand of the sea, until finally they gave up counting it, because it was without number.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">And before the year of the famine arrived there were born to Joseph two sons, whom As&acute;e&middot;nath the daughter of Pot&middot;i&acute;phe&middot;ra the priest of On bore to him.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">So Joseph called the name of the firstborn Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, because, to quote him, “God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And the name of the second he called E&acute;phra&middot;im, because, to quote him, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my wretchedness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">And the seven years of the plenty that had obtained in the land of Egypt gradually ended,</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">and, in turn, the seven years of the famine started to come, just as Joseph had said. And the famine developed in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was found bread.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">Finally all the land of Egypt became famished and the people began to cry to Phar&acute;aoh for bread. Then Phar&acute;aoh said to all the Egyptians: “Go to Joseph. Whatever he says to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to do.”</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">And the famine obtained over all the surface of the earth. Then Joseph began to open up all the grain depositories that were among them and to sell to the Egyptians, as the famine got a strong grip on the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Moreover, people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy from Joseph, because the famine had a strong grip on all the earth.</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="50">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="38">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Eventually Jacob got to see that there were cereals in Egypt. Then Jacob said to his sons: “Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep looking at one another?”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he added: “Here I have heard that there are cereals in Egypt. Go down there and buy for us from there, that we may keep alive and not die off.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Accordingly ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his other brothers, because he said: “Otherwise a fatal accident may befall him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So Israel’s sons came along with the others who were coming to buy, because the famine existed in the land of Ca&acute;naan.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Joseph was the man in power over the land. He was the one that did the selling to all people of the earth. Consequently Joseph’s brothers came and bowed low to him with their faces to the earth.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">When Joseph got to see his brothers, he at once recognized them, but he made himself unrecognizable to them. So he spoke harshly with them and said to them: “Where have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come from?” to which they said: “From the land of Ca&acute;naan to buy foodstuffs.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Thus Joseph recognized his brothers, but they themselves did not recognize him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Immediately Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed respecting them, and he went on to say to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are spies! Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have come to see the exposed condition of the land!”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then they said to him: “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy foodstuffs.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">We are all of us sons of but one man. We are upright men. Your servants do not act as spies.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But he said to them: “Not so! Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have come to see the exposed condition of the land!”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At this they said: “Your servants are twelve brothers. We are the sons of but one man in the land of Ca&acute;naan; and here the youngest is with our father today, whereas the other one is no more.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">However, Joseph said to them: “It is what I have spoken to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are spies!’</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">By this <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be tested out. As Phar&acute;aoh lives, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not go out of here except when <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> youngest brother comes here.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Send one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that he may get <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been bound, that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> words may be tested out as the truth in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> case. And if not, then, as Phar&acute;aoh lives, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are spies.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">With that he put them together in custody for three days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">After that Joseph said to them on the third day: “Do this and keep alive. I fear the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are upright, let one of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers be kept bound in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> house of custody, but the rest of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go, take cereals for the famine in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will bring <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> youngest brother to me, that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> words may be found trustworthy; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not die.” And they proceeded to do so.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they began to say one to the other: “Unquestionably we are guilty with regard to our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he implored compassion on our part, but we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then Reu&acute;ben answered them, saying: “Did not I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Do not sin against the child,’ but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not listen? And now his blood, here it is certainly asked back.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">As for them, they did not know that Joseph was listening, because there was an interpreter between them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Consequently he turned away from them and began to weep. Then he returned to them and spoke to them and took Sim&acute;e&middot;on from them and bound him before their eyes.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">After that Joseph gave the command, and they went filling up their receptacles with grain. Also, they were to return the money of the men to each one’s individual sack and to give them provisions for the journey. Accordingly it was done so to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So they loaded their cereals upon their asses and got on their way from there.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">When one opened his sack to give fodder to his ass at the lodging place, he got to see his money, and here it was in the mouth of his bag.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">At that he said to his brothers: “My money has been returned and now here it is in my bag!” Then their hearts sank, so that they turned trembling to one another, saying: “What is this God has done to us?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">At length they came to Jacob their father to the land of Ca&acute;naan and told him all the things that had befallen them, saying:</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us, since he took us for men spying on the country.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But we said to him, ‘We are upright men. We do not act as spies.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">We are twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Ca&acute;naan.’</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But the man who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘By this I am going to know <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are upright: Have one brother of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> stay with me. Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> take something for the famine in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses and go.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And bring <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> youngest brother to me, that I may know that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are no spies but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are upright. Your brother I shall give back to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may carry on business in the land.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And it came about that when they were emptying their sacks here was each one’s bundle of money in his sack. And they as well as their father got to see their bundles of money, and they became afraid.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then Jacob their father exclaimed to them: “It is I <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have bereaved! Joseph is no more and Sim&acute;e&middot;on is no more, and Benjamin <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are going to take! It is upon me that all these things have come!”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But Reu&acute;ben said to his father: “My own two sons you may put to death if I do not bring him back to you. Give him over to my care, and I shall be the one to return him to you.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">However, he said: “My son will not go down with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, because his brother is dead and he has been left by himself. If a fatal accident should befall him on the way on which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would go, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would certainly bring down my gray hairs with grief to She&acute;ol.”</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 43:1-34</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="34">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the famine was severe in the land.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it came about that as soon as they had finished eating up the cereals they had brought from Egypt, their father proceeded to say to them: “Return, buy a little food for us.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Judah said to him: “The man unmistakably bore witness to us, saying, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not see my face again unless <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother is with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">If you are sending our brother with us, we are willing to go down and buy food for you.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But if you are not sending him, we shall not go down, because the man did say to us, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not see my face again unless <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother is with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Israel exclaimed: “Why did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have to do harm to me by telling the man <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had another brother?”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">At this they said: “The man directly inquired concerning us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father yet alive? Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have another brother?’ and we went on to tell him according to these facts. How could we know for certain that he would say, ‘Bring <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother down’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Finally Judah said to Israel his father: “Send the boy with me, that we may get up and go and that we may keep alive and not die off, both we and you and our little children.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">I shall be the one to be surety for him. Out of my hand you may exact the penalty for him. If I fail to bring him to you and present him to you, then I shall have sinned against you for all time.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But if we had not lingered around, we should by now have been there and back these two times.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So Israel their father said to them: “If, then, that is the case, do this: Take the finest products of the land in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> receptacles and carry them down to the man as a gift: a little balsam, and a little honey, labdanum and resinous bark, pistachio nuts and almonds.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Also, take double the money in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bags <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will take back in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand. Maybe it was a mistake.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother and get up, return to the man.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And may God Almighty give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> pity before the man, that he may certainly release to <span class="smallcaps">YOU YOUR</span> other brother and Benjamin. But I, in case I must be bereaved, I shall certainly be bereaved!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Accordingly the men took this gift, and they took double the money in their hand and Benjamin. Then they rose and went their way down to Egypt and got to stand before Joseph.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he at once said to the man who was over his house: “Take the men to the house and slaughter animals and make preparation, because the men are to eat with me at noon.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Immediately the man did just as Joseph had said. So the man took the men to Joseph’s house.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But the men got afraid because they had been taken to Joseph’s house, and they began to say: “It is because of the money that went back with us in our bags at the start that we are being brought here for them to fall upon us and attack us and to take us for slaves and also our asses!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Hence they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and they said: “Excuse us, my lord! We surely did come down at the start to buy food.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But what occurred was that when we came to the lodging place and began opening our bags, why, here was the money of each one in the mouth of his bag, our money in full weight. So we would like to return it with our own hands.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And more money we have brought down in our hands to buy food. We certainly do not know who placed our money in our bags.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then he said: “It is all right with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Do not be afraid. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> God and the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> treasure in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bags. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> money came first to me.” After that he brought out Sim&acute;e&middot;on to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave water that they might have their feet washed, and he gave fodder for their asses.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they proceeded to get the gift ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, because they had heard that it was there they were going to eat bread.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">When Joseph went on into the house, then they brought the gift that was in their hand to him into the house, and prostrated themselves to him to the earth.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">After this he inquired whether they were getting along well and said: “Is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father, the aged man of whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have spoken, getting along well? Is he still alive?”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">To this they said: “Your servant our father is getting along well. He is still alive.” Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">When he raised his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, he went on to say: “Is this <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother, the youngest one of whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have spoken to me?” And he added: “May God show you his favor, my son.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Joseph was now in a hurry, because his inward emotions were excited toward his brother, so that he looked for a place to weep and he went into an interior room and gave way to tears there.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">After that he washed his face and went out and kept control of himself and said: “S<span class="smallcaps">ET</span> on the meal.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And they proceeded to set it on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves; for the Egyptians were not able to eat a meal with the Hebrews, because that is a detestable thing to the Egyptians.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his right as firstborn and the youngest according to his youngness; and the men kept looking at one another in amazement.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And he kept having portions carried from before him to them, but he would increase Benjamin’s portion five times the size of the portions of all the others. So they continued banqueting and drinking with him to the full.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Later on he commanded the man who was over his house, saying: “Fill the bags of the men with food to the extent they are able to carry it and place the money of each one in the mouth of his bag.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But you must place my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the bag of the youngest and the money for his cereals.” So he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">The morning had become light when the men were sent away, both they and their asses.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">They went out of the city. They had not gone far when Joseph said to the man who was over his house: “Get up! Chase after the men and be certain to overtake them and to say to them, ‘Why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> repaid bad for good?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Is not this the thing that my master drinks from and by means of which he expertly reads omens? It is a bad deed <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have committed.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Eventually he overtook them and spoke these words to them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But they said to him: “Why does my lord speak with such words as these? It is unthinkable that your servants should do anything like this.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Why, the money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of Ca&acute;naan. How, then, could we steal silver or gold from the house of your master?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Let the one of your slaves with whom it may be found die and let us ourselves also become slaves to my master.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So he said: “Let it be now exactly according to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> words. Thus the one with whom it may be found will become a slave to me, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will be proved innocent.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">With that they quickly let down each one his bag to the earth and they opened each one his own bag.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went searching carefully. He started with the oldest and finished with the youngest. At last the cup was found in Benjamin’s bag.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then they ripped their mantles apart and lifted each one his load back onto his ass and returned to the city.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Judah and his brothers went on into Joseph’s house, and he was still there; and they proceeded to fall before him to the earth.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Joseph now said to them: “What sort of deed is this that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have done? Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that such a man as I am can expertly read omens?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At this Judah exclaimed: “What can we say to my master? What can we speak? And how can we prove ourselves righteous? The [true] God has found out the error of your slaves. Here we are slaves to my master, both we and the one in whose hand the cup was found!”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">However, he said: “It is unthinkable for me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found is the one who will become a slave to me. As for the rest of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, go up in peace to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Judah now came near to him and said: “I pray you, my master, please let your slave speak a word in the hearing of my master, and do not let your anger grow hot against your slave, because it is the same with you as with Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">My master asked his slaves, saying, ‘Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have a father or a brother?’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So we said to my master, ‘We do have an aged father and a child of his old age, the youngest. But his brother is dead so that he alone is left of his mother, and his father does love him.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that you said to your slaves, ‘Bring him down to me that I may set my eye upon him.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But we said to my master, ‘The boy is not able to leave his father. If he did leave his father, he would certainly die.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then you said to your slaves, ‘Unless <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> youngest brother comes down with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not see my face anymore.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“And it came about that we went up to your slave my father and then told him the words of my master.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Later our father said, ‘Return, buy a little food for us.’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But we said, ‘We are not able to go down. If our youngest brother is with us we will go down, because we are not able to see the man’s face in case our youngest brother is not with us.’</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then your slave my father said to us, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves well know that my wife bore but two sons to me.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Later the one went out from my company and I exclaimed: “Ah, he must surely be torn to pieces!” and I have not seen him till now.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were to take this one also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would certainly bring down my gray hairs with calamity to She&acute;ol.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“And now, as soon as I should come to your slave my father without the boy along with us, when that one’s soul is bound up with this one’s soul,</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">then it is certain to occur that as soon as he sees that the boy is not there he will simply die, and your slaves will indeed bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father with grief to She&acute;ol.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For your slave became surety for the boy when away from his father, saying, ‘If I fail to bring him back to you, then I shall have sinned against my father forever.’</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So now, please, let your slave stay instead of the boy as a slave to my master, that the boy may go up with his brothers.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For how can I go up to my father without the boy along with me, for fear that then I may look upon the calamity that will find out my father?”</span>

<p class="title">Genesis 45:1-28</p>
<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At this Joseph was no longer able to control himself before all those who were stationed by him. So he cried out: “H<span class="smallcaps">AVE</span> everybody go out from me!” And no one else stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he began to raise his voice in weeping, so that the Egyptians got to hear it and Phar&acute;aoh’s house got to hear it.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Finally Joseph said to his brothers: “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were unable to answer him at all, because they were disturbed by reason of him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So Joseph said to his brothers: “Come close to me, please.” With that they came close to him.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">Then he said: “I am Joseph <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brother, whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sold into Egypt.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But now do not feel hurt and do not be angry with yourselves because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sold me here; because for the preservation of life God has sent me ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For this is the second year of the famine in the midst of the earth, and there are yet five years in which there will be no plowing time or harvest.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Consequently God sent me ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in order to place a remnant for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men in the earth and to keep <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> alive by a great escape.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So now it was not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who sent me here, but it was the [true] God, that he might appoint me a father to Phar&acute;aoh and a lord for all his house and as one dominating over all the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Go up quickly to my father, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph has said: “God has appointed me lord for all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not delay.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And you must dwell in the land of Go&acute;shen, and you must continue near me, you and your sons and the sons of your sons and your flocks and your herds and everything you have.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I will supply you with food there, for there are yet five years of famine; for fear you and your house and everything you have may come to poverty.”’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And here <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin are seeing that it is my mouth that is speaking to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and everything <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have seen; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must hurry and bring my father down here.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then he fell upon the neck of Benjamin his brother and gave way to weeping, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to kiss all his brothers and to weep over them, and after that his brothers spoke with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the news was heard at the house of Phar&acute;aoh, saying: “Joseph’s brothers have come!” And it proved to be good in the eyes of Phar&acute;aoh and of his servants.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Accordingly Phar&acute;aoh said to Joseph: “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> beasts of burden and go enter the land of Ca&acute;naan,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> households and come here to me, that I may give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the good of the land of Egypt; and eat the fat part of the land.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And you yourself are commanded: “Do this: T<span class="smallcaps">AKE</span> for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must lift <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father on one and come here.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And do not let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eye feel sorry over <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> equipment, because the good of all the land of Egypt is <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Following that the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons according to Phar&acute;aoh’s orders and gave them provisions for the way.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">To each of them he gave individual changes of mantles, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred silver pieces and five changes of mantles.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And to his father he sent as follows: ten asses carrying good things of Egypt and ten she-asses carrying grain and bread and sustenance for his father for the way.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Thus he sent his brothers off, and they proceeded to go. However, he said to them: “Do not get exasperated at one another on the way.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they began going up out of Egypt and at length came into the land of Ca&acute;naan to Jacob their father.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then they reported to him, saying: “Joseph is still alive, and he is the one dominating over all the land of Egypt!” But his heart grew numb, because he did not believe them.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">When they went on speaking to him all of Joseph’s words that he had spoken to them and he got to see the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father began to revive.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Israel exclaimed: “It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive! Ah, let me go and see him before I die!”</span>

       <span id="vs2">Then God talked to Israel in visions of the night and said: “Jacob, Jacob!” to which he said: “Here I am!”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he went on to say: “I am the [true] God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I shall constitute you there into a great nation.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs5">After that Jacob got up out of Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba, and the sons of Israel continued transporting Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons that Phar&acute;aoh had sent to transport him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Further, they took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Ca&acute;naan. Eventually they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Accordingly Joseph came and reported to Phar&acute;aoh and said: “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all they have have come from the land of Ca&acute;naan, and here they are in the land of Go&acute;shen.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And from the whole number of his brothers he took five men, that he might present them to Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Phar&acute;aoh said to his brothers: “What is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> occupation?” So they said to Phar&acute;aoh: “Your servants are herders of sheep, both we and our forefathers.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">After that they said to Phar&acute;aoh: “We have come to reside as aliens in the land, because there is no pasturage for the flock that your servants have, for the famine is severe in the land of Ca&acute;naan. And now let your servants dwell, please, in the land of Go&acute;shen.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At that Phar&acute;aoh said to Joseph: “Your father and your brothers have come here to you.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The land of Egypt is at your disposal. Have your father and your brothers dwell in the very best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Go&acute;shen, and if you know that there are among them courageous men, you must appoint them cattle chiefs over what is mine.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and introduced him to Phar&acute;aoh, and Jacob proceeded to bless Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Phar&acute;aoh now said to Jacob: “How many are the days of the years of your life?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So Jacob said to Phar&acute;aoh: “The days of the years of my alien residences are a hundred and thirty years. Few and distressing the days of the years of my life have proved, and they have not reached the days of the years of the lives of my fathers in the days of their alien residences.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">After that Jacob blessed Phar&acute;aoh and went out from before Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Thus Joseph had his father and his brothers dwell and he gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the very best of the land, in the land of Ram&acute;e&middot;ses, just as Phar&acute;aoh had commanded.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Joseph kept supplying his father and his brothers and the entire household of his father with bread, according to the number of the little ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now there was no bread in all the land, because the famine was very severe; and the land of Egypt and the land of Ca&acute;naan became exhausted as a result of the famine.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Joseph went on picking up all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Ca&acute;naan for the cereals which people were buying; and Joseph kept bringing the money into Phar&acute;aoh’s house.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In time the money from the land of Egypt and the land of Ca&acute;naan was spent, and all the Egyptians began coming to Joseph, saying: “Give us bread! And why should we die in front of you because money has run out?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Joseph said: “Hand over <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> livestock and I shall give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> bread in exchange for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> livestock, if money has run out.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they began bringing their livestock to Joseph; and Joseph kept giving them bread in exchange for their horses and the livestock of the flock and the livestock of the herd and the asses, and he kept providing them with bread in exchange for all their livestock during that year.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Gradually that year came to its close, and they began coming to him in the next year and saying to him: “We shall not hide it from my lord but the money and the stock of domestic animals have been spent to my lord. There remains nothing before my lord but our bodies and our land.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we together with our land will become slaves to Phar&acute;aoh; and give us seed that we may live and not die and our land not be laid desolate.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians for Phar&acute;aoh, because the Egyptians sold each one his field, for the famine had got a strong grip on them; and the land came to be Phar&acute;aoh’s.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">As for the people, he removed them into cities from one end of the territory of Egypt to its other end.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the rations for the priests were from Phar&acute;aoh and they ate their rations that Phar&acute;aoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then Joseph said to the people: “See, I have today bought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> land for Phar&acute;aoh. Here is seed for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must sow the land with it.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">When it has resulted in produce, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must give a fifth to Phar&acute;aoh, but four parts will become <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> as seed for the field and as food for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and for those who are in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses and for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones to eat.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Consequently they said: “You have preserved our lives. Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will become slaves to Phar&acute;aoh.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Joseph proceeded to make it a decree down to this day over the landed estate of Egypt for Phar&acute;aoh to have to the amount of a fifth. Only the land of the priests as a distinct group did not become Phar&acute;aoh’s.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And Israel continued to dwell in the land of Egypt, in the land of Go&acute;shen; and they became settled in it and were fruitful and grew to be very many.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Jacob lived on in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, so that Jacob’s days, the years of his life, came to be a hundred and forty-seven years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Gradually the days approached for Israel to die. So he called his son Joseph and said to him: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, place your hand, please, under my thigh, and you must exercise loving-kindness and trustworthiness toward me. (Please, do not bury me in Egypt.)</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And I must lie with my fathers, and you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their grave.” Accordingly he said: “I myself shall do in keeping with your word.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then he said: “Swear to me.” So he swore to him. At that Israel prostrated himself over the head of the couch.</span>

       <span id="vs2">Then it was reported to Jacob and said: “Here your son Joseph has come to you.” So Israel exerted his strength and sat up on his couch.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Jacob proceeded to say to Joseph:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Ca&acute;naan that he might bless me.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he went on to say to me, ‘Here I am making you fruitful, and I will make you many and I will transform you into a congregation of peoples and I will give this land to your seed after you for a possession to time indefinite.’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came here to you into Egypt, they are mine. E&acute;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh will become mine like Reu&acute;ben and Sim&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But your progeny to which you shall become father after them will become yours. Together with the name of their brothers they will be called in their inheritance.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And as for me, when I was coming from Pad&acute;dan, Rachel died alongside me in the land of Ca&acute;naan on the way while there was yet a good stretch of land before coming to Eph&acute;rath, so that I buried her there on the way to Eph&acute;rath, that is to say, Beth&acute;le&middot;hem.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and said: “Who are these?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So Joseph said to his father: “They are my sons whom God has given me in this place.” At this he said: “Bring them, please, to me that I may bless them.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now the eyes of Israel were dull from old age. He was unable to see. Accordingly he brought them close to him, and he then kissed them and embraced them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Israel went on to say to Joseph: “I had no idea of seeing your face, but here God has let me see also your offspring.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">After that Joseph brought them out away from his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Joseph now took the two of them, E&acute;phra&middot;im by his right hand to Israel’s left, and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh by his left hand to Israel’s right, and brought them close to him.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">However, Israel put out his right hand and placed it on E&acute;phra&middot;im’s head, although he was the younger, and his left hand upon Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh’s head. He purposely laid his hands so, since Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh was the firstborn.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to bless Joseph and to say:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs15-2">“The [true] God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,<br><span class="z">The [true] God who has been shepherding me during all my existence until this day,</span></span>
</p>

<p class="p"><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The angel who has been recovering me from all calamity, bless the boys.<br><span class="z">And let my name be called upon them and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac,</span><br><span class="z">And let them increase to a multitude in the midst of the earth.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When Joseph saw that his father kept his right hand placed on E&acute;phra&middot;im’s head, it was displeasing to him, and he tried to take hold of his father’s hand to remove it from E&acute;phra&middot;im’s head to Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh’s head.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Hence Joseph said to his father: “Not so, my father, because this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But his father kept refusing and said: “I know it, my son, I know it. He too will become a people and he too will become great. But, just the same, his younger brother will become greater than he will, and his offspring will become the full equivalent of nations.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he continued to bless them on that day, saying:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs20-2">“By means of you let Israel repeatedly pronounce blessing, saying,<br><span class="p">‘May God constitute you like E&acute;phra&middot;im and like Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh.’”</span></span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs20-4">Thus he kept putting E&acute;phra&middot;im before Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that Israel said to Joseph: “Look, I am dying, but God will certainly continue with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people and return <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the land of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">As for me, I do give you one shoulder [of land] more than to your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites by my sword and by my bow.”</span>

       <span id="vs4">Finally the days of weeping for him passed, and Joseph spoke to Phar&acute;aoh’s household, saying: “If, now, I have found favor in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes, speak, please, in the hearing of Phar&acute;aoh, saying,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs7">So Joseph went up to bury his father, and there went up with him all of Phar&acute;aoh’s servants, the older men of his household and all the older men of the land of Egypt,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and all of Joseph’s household and his brothers and the household of his father. Only their little children and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of Go&acute;shen.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and the camp came to be very numerous.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then they came to the threshing floor of A&acute;tad, which is in the region of the Jordan, and there they carried on a very great and heavy wailing and he kept up the mourning rites for his father seven days.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the inhabitants of the land, the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, got to see the mourning rites in the threshing floor of A&acute;tad, and they exclaimed: “This is a heavy mourning for the Egyptians!” That is why its name was called A&acute;bel-miz&acute;ra&middot;im, which is in the region of the Jordan.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And his sons proceeded to do for him exactly as he had commanded them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So his sons carried him into the land of Ca&acute;naan and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach&middot;pe&acute;lah, the field that Abraham had purchased for the possession of a burial place from E&acute;phron the Hit&acute;tite in front of Mam&acute;re.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Afterward Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all those who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When the brothers of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they began to say: “It may be that Joseph is harboring animosity against us and he will be sure to repay us for all the evil that we have rendered him.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So they expressed a command to Joseph in these words: “Your father gave the command before his death, saying,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">‘This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to say to Joseph: “I beseech you, pardon, please, the revolt of your brothers and their sin in that they have rendered evil to you.”’ And now pardon, please, the revolt of the servants of your father’s God.” And Joseph burst into tears when they spoke to him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Following that his brothers also came and fell down before him and said: “Here we are as slaves to you!”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Joseph said to them: “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had evil in mind against me. God had it in mind for good for the purpose of acting as at this day to preserve many people alive.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So now do not be afraid. I myself shall keep supplying <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little children with food.” Thus he comforted them and spoke reassuringly to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Joseph continued to dwell in Egypt, he and the house of his father; and Joseph lived for a hundred and ten years.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And Joseph got to see E&acute;phra&middot;im’s sons of the third generation, also the sons of Ma&acute;chir, Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh’s son. They were born upon Joseph’s knees.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At length Joseph said to his brothers: “I am dying; but God will without fail turn his attention to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and he will certainly bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up out of this land to the land about which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Hence Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying: “God will without fail turn his attention to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Accordingly <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must take my bones up out of here.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">After that Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten years; and they had him embalmed, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span>
