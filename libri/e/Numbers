<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

       <span id="vs25">And they must carry the tent cloths of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting, its covering and the sealskin covering that is on top over it, and the screen of the entrance of the tent of meeting,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">and the hangings of the courtyard and the entrance screen of the gate of the courtyard that is round about the tabernacle and the altar, and their tent cords and all their service utensils, and all things with which work is regularly done.

       <span id="vs27">At the order of Aaron and his sons all the service of the sons of the Ger&acute;shon&middot;ites should take place as regards all their loads and all their service, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must assign all their loads to them by obligation.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">This is the service of the families of the sons of the Ger&acute;shon&middot;ites in the tent of meeting, and their obligatory service is under the hand of Ith&acute;a&middot;mar the son of Aaron the priest.</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And Moses and Aaron and the chieftains of the assembly proceeded to register the sons of the Ko&acute;hath&middot;ites by their families and by the house of their fathers,</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Command the sons of Israel that they send out of the camp every leprous person and everyone having a running discharge and everyone unclean by a deceased soul.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Whether a male or a female <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should send them out. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> should send them outside the camp, that they may not contaminate the camps of those in the midst of whom I am tabernacling.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the sons of Israel proceeded to do so, even to send them outside the camp. Just as Jehovah had spoken to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Speak to the sons of Israel, ‘As for a man or a woman, in case they do any of all the sins of mankind in committing an act of unfaithfulness against Jehovah, that soul has also become guilty.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they must confess their sin that they have done, and he must return the amount of his guilt in its principal, also adding a fifth of it to it, and he must give it to the one against whom he did wrong.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But if the latter has no near relative to whom to return the amount of the guilt, the amount of the guilt that is being returned to Jehovah belongs to the priest, except the ram of atonement with which he will make atonement for him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“‘And every contribution of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they will present to the priest, should become his.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the holy things of each one will remain his own. Whatever each one may give to the priest, that will become his.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘In case any man’s wife turns aside in that she does commit an act of unfaithfulness against him,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and another man actually lies down with her and has an emission of semen, and it has been hidden from the eyes of her husband and has remained undiscovered, and she, on her part, has defiled herself but there is no witness against her, and she herself has not been caught;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and the spirit of jealousy has passed upon him, and he has become suspicious of his wife’s faithfulness, and she in fact has defiled herself, or the spirit of jealousy has passed upon him, and he has become suspicious of his wife’s faithfulness, but she in fact has not defiled herself;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">then the man must bring his wife to the priest and bring her offering along with her, a tenth of an e&acute;phah of barley flour. He must not pour oil upon it nor put frankincense upon it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a memorial grain offering bringing error to remembrance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“‘And the priest must bring her forward and make her stand before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the priest must take holy water in an earthenware vessel, and the priest will take some of the dust that happens to be on the floor of the tabernacle, and he must put it in the water.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the priest must make the woman stand before Jehovah and loosen the hair of the woman’s head and put upon her palms the memorial grain offering, that is, the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest there should be the bitter water that brings a curse.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“‘And the priest must make her swear, and he must say to the woman: “If no man has lain down with you and if while under your husband you have not turned aside in any uncleanness, be free of the effect of this bitter water that brings a curse.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But you, in case you have turned aside while under your husband and in case you have defiled yourself and some man has put in you his seminal emission, besides your husband,—”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">The priest must now make the woman swear with an oath involving cursing, and the priest must say to the woman: “May Jehovah set you for a cursing and an oath in the midst of your people by Jehovah’s letting your thigh fall away, and your belly swell.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And this water that brings a curse must enter into your intestines to cause your belly to swell and the thigh to fall away.” To this the woman must say: “Amen! Amen!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“‘And the priest must write these cursings in the book and must wipe them out into the bitter water.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he must make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse must enter into her as something bitter.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the priest must take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand and wave the grain offering to and fro before Jehovah, and he must bring it near the altar.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the priest must grasp some of the grain offering as a remembrancer of it and must make it smoke upon the altar, and afterward he will make the woman drink the water.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">When he has made her drink the water, it must also occur that if she has defiled herself in that she committed an act of unfaithfulness toward her husband, the water that brings a curse must then enter into her as something bitter, and her belly must swell, and her thigh must fall away, and the woman must become a cursing in among her people.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">However, if the woman has not defiled herself but she is clean, she must then be free from such punishment; and she must be made pregnant with semen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“‘This is the law about jealousy, where a woman may turn aside while under her husband, and she does defile herself,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">or in the case of a man where the spirit of jealousy may pass upon him, and he does suspect his wife of unfaithfulness; and he must make the wife stand before Jehovah, and the priest must carry out toward her all this law.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the man must be innocent of error, but that wife will answer for her error.’”</span>

       <span id="vs19">And the priest must take a boiled shoulder from the ram and one unfermented ring-shaped cake out of the basket, and one unfermented wafer, and put them upon the palms of the Naz&acute;i&middot;rite after he has had the sign of his Naziriteship shaved off.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

       <span id="vs1">Now it came about on the day that Moses finished setting up the tabernacle that he proceeded to anoint it and to sanctify it and all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils. Thus he anointed them and sanctified them.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then the chieftains of Israel, the heads of the house of their fathers, made a presentation, they being the chieftains of the tribes and standing over the ones registered,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered wagons and twelve cattle, a wagon for two chieftains and a bull for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At this Jehovah said to Moses:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs2">“Speak to Aaron, and you must say to him, ‘Whenever you light up the lamps, the seven lamps should shine on the area in front of the lampstand.’”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Aaron began to do so. He lit up its lamps for the area in front of the lampstand, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand. It was hammered work of gold. Up to its sides and up to its blossoms it was hammered work. According to the vision that Jehovah had shown Moses, so he had made the lampstand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and you must cleanse them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And this is what you should do to them to cleanse them: Spatter sin-cleansing water upon them, and they must have a razor pass over all their flesh and must wash their garments and cleanse themselves.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then they must take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour moistened with oil, and you will take another young bull for a sin offering.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And you must present the Levites before the tent of meeting and congregate all the assembly of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And you must present the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel must lay their hands upon the Levites.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Aaron must cause the Levites to move to and fro before Jehovah as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, and they must serve for carrying on the service of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Then the Levites will lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls. After that, render up the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to Jehovah to make atonement for the Levites.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And you must have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and must cause them to move to and fro as a wave offering to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And you must separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites must become mine.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And afterward the Levites will come in to serve at the tent of meeting. So you must cleanse them and cause them to move to and fro as a wave offering.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For they are given ones, given to me from among the sons of Israel. In place of those opening all wombs, all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, I must take them for myself.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is mine, among man and among beast. On the day of my striking every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to myself.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I shall take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I shall give the Levites as given ones to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to carry on the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the sons of Israel, that no plague may occur among the sons of Israel because the sons of Israel approach the holy place.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the sons of Israel proceeded to do so to the Levites. In accord with all that Jehovah had commanded Moses as regards the Levites, that is the way the sons of Israel did to them.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments, after which Aaron caused them to move to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah. Then Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">First after that the Levites came in to carry on their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons. Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses respecting the Levites, so they did to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“This is what applies to the Levites: From twenty-five years old upward he will come to enter into the company in the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But after the age of fifty years he will retire from the service company and serve no longer.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he must minister to his brothers in the tent of meeting in taking care of the obligation, but he must render no service. In accord with this you will do to the Levites in their obligations.”</span>

       <span id="vs16">That is the way it went on constantly: The cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And whenever the cloud would go up from over the tent, the sons of Israel would pull away right afterward, and in the place where the cloud would reside, there is where the sons of Israel would encamp.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At the order of Jehovah the sons of Israel would pull away, and at the order of Jehovah they would encamp. All the days that the cloud would reside over the tabernacle, they would remain encamped.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs21">And sometimes the cloud would continue from evening to morning; and the cloud lifted itself in the morning, and they pulled away. Whether it was by day or by night that the cloud lifted itself, they also pulled away.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Whether it was two days or a month or more days during which the cloud prolonged its stay over the tabernacle by residing over it, the sons of Israel remained encamped and would not pull away, but when it lifted itself they would pull away.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At the order of Jehovah they would encamp, and at the order of Jehovah they would pull away. They kept their obligation to Jehovah at the order of Jehovah by means of Moses.</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Make for yourself two trumpets of silver. You will make them of hammered work, and they must be at your service for convening the assembly and for breaking up the camps.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs4">And if they should blow on just one, the chieftains as heads of the thousands of Israel must also keep their appointment with you.</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Now when calling the congregation together, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should blow, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not sound a fluctuating blast.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Aaron’s sons, the priests, should blow on the trumpets, and the use of them must serve as a statute for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men to time indefinite during <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations.</span>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Now it came about that in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day in the month, the cloud lifted itself from over the tabernacle of the Testimony.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the sons of Israel began to pull away in the manner of their departures from the wilderness of Si&acute;nai, and the cloud proceeded to reside in the wilderness of Pa&acute;ran.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs18">And the [three-tribe] division of the camp of Reu&acute;ben pulled away in their armies, and E&middot;li&acute;zur the son of Shed&acute;e&middot;ur was over its army.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Sim&acute;e&middot;on there was She&middot;lu&acute;mi&middot;el the son of Zu&middot;ri&middot;shad&acute;dai.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

       <span id="vs22">And the [three-tribe] division of the camp of the sons of E&acute;phra&middot;im pulled away in their armies, and E&middot;lish&acute;a&middot;ma the son of Am&middot;mi&acute;hud was over its army.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh there was Ga&middot;ma&acute;li&middot;el the son of Pe&middot;dah&acute;zur.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin there was Ab&acute;i&middot;dan the son of Gid&middot;e&middot;o&acute;ni.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the [three-tribe] division of the camp of the sons of Dan pulled away as forming the rear guard for all the camps in their armies, and A&middot;hi&middot;e&acute;zer the son of Am&middot;mi&middot;shad&acute;dai was over its army.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Ash&acute;er there was Pa&acute;gi&middot;el the son of Och&acute;ran.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li there was A&middot;hi&acute;ra the son of E&acute;nan.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In this manner were the departures of the sons of Israel in their armies when they would pull away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then Moses said to Ho&acute;bab the son of Reu&acute;el the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are pulling away for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I shall give it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’ Do come with us, and we shall certainly do good to you, because Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But he said to him: “I shall not go along, but I shall go to my own country and to my relatives.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At this he said: “Please, do not leave us, because, for the reason that you well know where we may encamp in the wilderness, you must serve as eyes for us.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And it must occur that in case you should come with us, yes, it must occur that with what goodness Jehovah will do good with us, we, in turn, will do good to you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So they went marching from the mountain of Jehovah for a journey of three days, and the ark of Jehovah’s covenant was marching before them for a journey of three days to search out a resting-place for them.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And Jehovah’s cloud was over them by day at their marching out from the encampment.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And it would occur that when the Ark would set out, Moses would say: “Do arise, O Jehovah, and let your enemies be scattered; and let those who intensely hate you flee from before you.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And when it would rest, he would say: “Do return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of thousands of Israel.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now the people became as men having something evil to complain about in the ears of Jehovah. When Jehovah got to hear it, then his anger grew hot, and a fire of Jehovah began to blaze against them and to consume some in the extremity of the camp.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">When the people began to cry out to Moses, then he made supplication to Jehovah, and the fire sank down.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the name of that place got to be called Tab&acute;e&middot;rah, because a fire of Jehovah had blazed against them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the mixed crowd that was in the midst of them expressed selfish longing, and the sons of Israel too began to weep again and say: “Who will give us meat to eat?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">How we remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the watermelons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic!</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But now our soul is dried away. Our eyes are on nothing at all except the manna.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Incidentally, the manna was like coriander seed, and its look was like the look of bdellium gum.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The people spread out and picked it up and ground it in hand mills or pounded it in a mortar, and they boiled it in cooking pots or made it into round cakes, and its taste proved to be like the taste of an oiled sweet cake.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And when the dew descended upon the camp by night, the manna would descend upon it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Moses got to hear the people weeping in their families, each man at the entrance of his tent. And Jehovah’s anger began growing very hot, and in the eyes of Moses it was bad.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Moses said to Jehovah: “Why have you caused evil to your servant, and why have I not found favor in your eyes, in placing the load of all this people upon me?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Have I myself conceived all this people? Is it I who have given them birth, so that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, just as the male nurse carries the suckling,’ to the soil about which you swore to their forefathers?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">From where do I have meat to give to all this people? For they keep weeping toward me, saying, ‘Do give us meat, and let us eat!’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I am not able, I by myself, to carry all this people, because they are too heavy for me.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So if this is the way you are doing to me, please kill me off altogether, if I have found favor in your eyes, and let me not look upon my calamity.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In turn Jehovah said to Moses: “Gather for me seventy men of the older men of Israel, whom you do know that they are older men of the people and officers of theirs, and you must take them to the tent of meeting, and they must station themselves there with you.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I shall have to come down and speak with you there; and I shall have to take away some of the spirit that is upon you and place it upon them, and they will have to help you in carrying the load of the people that you may not carry it, just you alone.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And to the people you should say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly eat meat, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying: “Who will give us meat to eat, for it was well with us in Egypt?” And Jehovah will certainly give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> meat, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will indeed eat.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will eat, not one day nor two days nor five days nor ten days nor twenty days,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">but up to a month of days, until it comes out of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> nostrils and it has become a loathing to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, just because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rejected Jehovah, who is in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> went weeping before him, saying: “Why is it that we have come out of Egypt?”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then Moses said: “The people in the midst of whom I am are six hundred thousand men on foot, and yet you—you have said, ‘Meat I shall give them, and they will certainly eat for a month of days’!</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Will flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, for it to be adequate for them? Or will all the fish of the sea be caught for them, for it to be adequate for them?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At this Jehovah said to Moses: “The hand of Jehovah is cut short, is it? Now you will see whether what I say befalls you or not.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">After that Moses went out and spoke to the people the words of Jehovah. And he went gathering seventy men from the older men of the people and proceeded to have them stand round about the tent.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then Jehovah came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon each of the seventy older men. And it came about that as soon as the spirit settled down upon them, then they proceeded to act as prophets; but they did not do it again.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Now there were two of the men remaining in the camp. The name of the one was El&acute;dad, and the name of the other was Me&acute;dad. And the spirit began to settle down upon them, as they were among those written down, but they had not gone out to the tent. So they proceeded to act as prophets in the camp.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And a young man went running and reporting to Moses and saying: “El&acute;dad and Me&acute;dad are acting as prophets in the camp!”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his young manhood on, responded and said: “My lord Moses, restrain them!”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">However, Moses said to him: “Are you feeling jealous for me? No, I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophets, because Jehovah would put his spirit upon them!”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Later Moses withdrew to the camp, he and the older men of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And a wind burst forth from Jehovah and began driving quails from the sea and letting them fall above the camp about a day’s journey this way and about a day’s journey that way, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then the people got up all that day and all night and all the next day and kept gathering the quail. The one collecting least gathered ten ho&acute;mers, and they kept spreading them extensively all around the camp for themselves.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">The meat was yet between their teeth, before it could be chewed, when Jehovah’s anger blazed against the people, and Jehovah began striking at the people with a very great slaughter.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">The name of that place came to be called Kib&acute;roth-hat&middot;ta&acute;a&middot;vah, because there they buried the people who showed selfish craving.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">From Kib&acute;roth-hat&middot;ta&acute;a&middot;vah the people pulled away for Ha&middot;ze&acute;roth, and they continued in Ha&middot;ze&acute;roth.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now Mir&acute;i&middot;am and Aaron began to speak against Moses on account of the Cush&acute;ite wife whom he had taken, because it was a Cush&acute;ite wife he had taken.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And they kept saying: “Is it just by Moses alone that Jehovah has spoken? Is it not by us also that he has spoken?” And Jehovah was listening.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Jehovah suddenly said to Moses and Aaron and Mir&acute;i&middot;am: “Go out, the three of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">After that Jehovah came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Mir&acute;i&middot;am. At this both of them went out.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he went on to say: “Hear my words, please. If there came to be a prophet of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> for Jehovah, it would be in a vision I would make myself known to him. In a dream I would speak to him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Not so my servant Moses! He is being entrusted with all my house.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Mouth to mouth I speak to him, thus showing him, and not by riddles; and the appearance of Jehovah is what he beholds. Why, then, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not fear to speak against my servant, against Moses?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah’s anger got to be hot against them, and he went his way.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the cloud turned away from over the tent, and, look! Mir&acute;i&middot;am was struck with leprosy as white as snow. Then Aaron turned toward Mir&acute;i&middot;am, and, look! she was struck with leprosy.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Immediately Aaron said to Moses: “Excuse me, my lord! Do not, please, attribute to us the sin in which we have acted foolishly and which we have committed!</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Please, do not let her continue like someone dead, whose flesh at the time of his coming out of his mother’s womb is half eaten off!”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Moses began to cry out to Jehovah, saying: “O God, please! Heal her, please!”</span>

       <span id="vs15">Accordingly Mir&acute;i&middot;am was quarantined outside the camp seven days, and the people did not pull away until Mir&acute;i&middot;am was received in.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When Moses was sending them to spy out the land of Ca&acute;naan, he proceeded to say to them: “Go up here into the Neg&acute;eb, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must go up into the mountainous region.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must see what the land is and the people who are dwelling on it, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and what the land is in which they are dwelling, whether it is good or bad, and what the cities are in which they are dwelling, whether it is in encampments or in fortifications;</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there are trees in it or not. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must show yourselves courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land.” Now the days were the days of the first ripe fruits of the grapes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Re&acute;hob to the entering in of Ha&acute;math.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">When they went up into the Neg&acute;eb, they then came to He&acute;bron. Now A&middot;hi&acute;man, She&acute;shai and Tal&acute;mai, those born of A&acute;nak, were there. Incidentally, He&acute;bron had been built seven years before Zo&acute;an of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">When they came to the torrent valley of Esh&acute;col, they then proceeded to cut down from there a shoot with one cluster of grapes. And they went carrying it with a bar on two of the men, and also some of the pomegranates and some of the figs.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">They called that place the torrent valley of Esh&acute;col, on account of the cluster that the sons of Israel cut down from there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Finally at the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So they walked and came to Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Pa&acute;ran, at Ka&acute;desh. And they came bringing back word to them and all the assembly and showing them the fruitage of the land.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And they went on to report to him and say: “We entered into the land to which you sent us out, and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruitage.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Nevertheless, the facts are that the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the fortified cities are very great; and, too, those born of A&acute;nak we saw there.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites are dwelling in the land of the Neg&acute;eb, and the Hit&acute;tites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites are dwelling in the mountainous region, and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites are dwelling by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then Ca&acute;leb tried to still the people toward Moses and went on to say: “Let us go up directly, and we are bound to take possession of it, because we can surely prevail over it.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But the men who went up with him said: “We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And they kept on bringing forth to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying: “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in the midst of it are men of extraordinary size.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And there we saw the Neph&acute;i&middot;lim, the sons of A&acute;nak, who are from the Neph&acute;i&middot;lim; so that we became in our own eyes like grasshoppers, and the same way we became in their eyes.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then all the assembly raised their voice, and the people continued giving vent to their voice and weeping all through that night.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And all the sons of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, and all the assembly began to say against them: “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">They even went to saying to one another: “Let us appoint a head, and let us return to Egypt!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before all the congregation of the assembly of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Joshua the son of Nun and Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh, who were of those who spied out the land, ripped their garments apart,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and they proceeded to say this to all the assembly of the sons of Israel: “The land that we passed through to spy it out is a very, very good land.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">If Jehovah has found delight in us, then he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Only against Jehovah do not rebel; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fear the people of the land, for they are bread to us. Their shelter has turned away from over them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">However, all the assembly talked of pelting them with stones. And Jehovah’s glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Finally Jehovah said to Moses: “How long will this people treat me without respect, and how long will they not put faith in me for all the signs that I performed in among them?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away, and let me make you a nation greater and mightier than they are.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But Moses said to Jehovah: “Then the Egyptians will be bound to hear that you by your power have led this people up out of their midst.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they will be bound to tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you are Jehovah in among this people, who has appeared face to face. You are Jehovah, and your cloud is standing over them, and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Were you to put this people to death as one man, then the nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.’</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And now, please, let your power become great, O Jehovah, just as you have spoken, saying,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, pardoning error and transgression, but by no means will he give exemption from punishment, bringing punishment for the error of the fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Forgive, please, the error of this people according to the greatness of your loving-kindness, and just as you have pardoned this people from Egypt onward until now.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then Jehovah said: “I do forgive according to your word.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And, on the other hand, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But all the men who have been seeing my glory and my signs that I have performed in Egypt and in the wilderness and yet kept testing me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">will never see the land about which I swore to their fathers, yes, all those treating me without respect will not see it.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">As for my servant Ca&acute;leb, because a different spirit has proved to be with him and he kept following wholly after me, I shall certainly bring him into the land where he has gone, and his offspring will take possession of it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">While the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites are dwelling in the low plain, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people make a turn tomorrow and pull away to march to the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Jehovah went on to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying:</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“How long will this evil assembly have this murmuring that they are carrying on against me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel that they are murmuring against me.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Say to them, ‘“As I live,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “if I shall not do to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> just that way as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have spoken in my ears!</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In this wilderness <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> carcasses will fall, yes, all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> registered ones of all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> number from twenty years old upward, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have murmured against me.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not enter into the land in which I lifted up my hand [in oath] to reside with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, except Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh and Joshua the son of Nun.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“‘“And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones who <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> said would become plunder, these also I shall certainly bring in, and they will indeed know the land that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have rejected.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But the carcasses of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will fall in this wilderness.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons will become shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and they will have to answer for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> acts of fornication, until <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> carcasses come to their end in the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">By the number of the days that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> spied out the land, forty days, a day for a year, a day for a year, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will answer for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> errors forty years, as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must know what my being estranged means.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“‘“I Jehovah have spoken if this is not what I shall do to all this evil assembly, those who have gathered together against me: In this wilderness they will come to their end, and there they will die.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who, when they returned, began making the whole assembly murmur against him, by bringing forth a bad report against the land,</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">yes, the men bringing forth the bad report about the land will die by the scourge before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">But Joshua the son of Nun and Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh will certainly live on, of those men who went to spy out the land.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">When Moses proceeded to speak these words to all the sons of Israel, then the people began to mourn a great deal.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Moreover, they got up early in the morning and tried to go up to the top of the mountain, saying: “Here we are, and we have to go up to the place that Jehovah mentioned. For we have sinned.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">But Moses said: “Why is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are passing beyond the order of Jehovah? But that will not succeed.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Do not go up, because Jehovah is not in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not be defeated before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">For the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites are there before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are certain to fall by the sword, because, for the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> turned back from following Jehovah, Jehovah will not continue with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">However, they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, but the ark of Jehovah’s covenant and Moses did not move away from the midst of the camp.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites who were dwelling in that mountain came on down and began striking them and went scattering them as far as Hor&acute;mah.</span>

       <span id="vs17">And Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘On <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> coming into the land where I am bringing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs21">Some of the firstfruits of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> coarse meal <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should give as a contribution to Jehovah throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“‘Now in case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should make a mistake and not do all these commandments, which Jehovah has spoken to Moses,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">all that Jehovah has commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by means of Moses from the day that Jehovah commanded and onward for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">it must then occur that if it has been done far from the eyes of the assembly by mistake, the whole assembly must then render up one young bull as a burnt offering for a restful odor to Jehovah, and its grain offering and its drink offering according to the regular procedure, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the priest must make atonement for the whole assembly of the sons of Israel, and it must be forgiven them; because it was a mistake, and they, for their part, brought as their offering an offering made by fire to Jehovah and their sin offering before Jehovah for their mistake.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And it must be forgiven the whole assembly of the sons of Israel and the alien resident who is residing as an alien in their midst, because it was by mistake on the part of all the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“‘And if any soul should sin by mistake, then he must present a female goat in its first year for a sin offering.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the priest must make atonement for the soul who made a mistake by a sin unintentionally before Jehovah, so as to make atonement for it, and it must be forgiven him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">As to the native among the sons of Israel and the alien resident who is residing as an alien in their midst, there should prove to be one law for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as respects doing something unintentionally.</span>

       <span id="vs31">Because it is Jehovah’s word that he has despised and his commandment that he has broken, that soul should be cut off without fail. His own error is upon him.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">While the sons of Israel were continuing in the wilderness, they once found a man collecting pieces of wood on the sabbath day.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then those who found him collecting pieces of wood brought him up to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">So they committed him into custody, because it had not been distinctly stated what should be done to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">In time Jehovah said to Moses: “Without fail the man should be put to death, the whole assembly pelting him with stones outside the camp.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Accordingly the whole assembly brought him forth outside the camp and pelted him with stones so that he died, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And Jehovah went on to say this to Moses:</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them that they must make for themselves fringed edges upon the skirts of their garments throughout their generations, and they must put a blue string above the fringed edge of the skirt,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">‘And it must serve as a fringed edge for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must see it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not go about following <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes, which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are following in immoral intercourse.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">The purpose is that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may remember and may certainly do all my commandments and indeed prove to be holy to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, who have brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of the land of Egypt in order to prove myself <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God. I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Ko&acute;rah the son of Iz&acute;har, the son of Ko&acute;hath, the son of Le&acute;vi, proceeded to get up, together with Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram the sons of E&middot;li&acute;ab, and On the son of Pe&acute;leth, the sons of Reu&acute;ben.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And they proceeded to rise up before Moses, they and two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, chieftains of the assembly, summoned ones of the meeting, men of fame.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So they congregated themselves against Moses and Aaron and said to them: “That is enough of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because the whole assembly are all of them holy and Jehovah is in their midst. Why, then, should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> lift yourselves up above the congregation of Jehovah?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When Moses got to hear it he at once fell upon his face.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then he spoke to Ko&acute;rah and to his entire assembly, saying: “In the morning Jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who must come near to him, and whoever he may choose will come near to him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Do this: Take fire holders for yourselves, Ko&acute;rah and his entire assembly,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and put fire in them and place incense upon them before Jehovah tomorrow, and it must occur that the man whom Jehovah will choose, he is the holy one. That is enough of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sons of Le&acute;vi!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Moses went on to say to Ko&acute;rah: “Listen, please, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sons of Le&acute;vi.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Is it such a little thing for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men that the God of Israel has separated <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men from the assembly of Israel to present <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to himself to carry on the service of Jehovah’s tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and that he should bring you and all your brothers the sons of Le&acute;vi with you near? So must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men also try to secure the priesthood?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For that reason you and all your assembly who are gathering together are against Jehovah. As for Aaron, what is he that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men should murmur against him?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Later Moses sent to call Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram the sons of E&middot;li&acute;ab, but they said: “We are not going to come up!</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Is it so little a thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness, that you should also try to play the prince over us to the limit?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">As it is, you have not brought us into any land flowing with milk and honey, that you may give us an inheritance of field and vineyard. Is it the eyes of those men that you want to bore out? We are not going to come up!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah: “Do not turn to look at their grain offering. Not one male ass have I taken away from them, nor have I harmed one of them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Moses said to Ko&acute;rah: “You and all your assembly, be present before Jehovah, you and they and Aaron, tomorrow.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And take each one his fire holder, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men must put incense upon them and present each one his fire holder before Jehovah, two hundred and fifty fire holders, and you and Aaron each his fire holder.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So they took each one his fire holder and put fire upon them and placed incense upon them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting together with Moses and Aaron.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When Ko&acute;rah got all the assembly together against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, then Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the assembly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Jehovah now spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, that I may exterminate them in an instant.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At this they fell upon their faces and said: “O God, the God of the spirits of every sort of flesh, will just one man sin and you become indignant against the entire assembly?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In turn Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Speak to the assembly, saying, ‘Get away from around the tabernacles of Ko&acute;rah, Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram!’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">After that Moses got up and went to Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram, and the older men of Israel went with him.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then he spoke to the assembly, saying: “Turn aside, please, from before the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not be swept away in all their sin.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Immediately they got away from before the tabernacle of Ko&acute;rah, Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram, from every side, and Da&acute;than and A&middot;bi&acute;ram came out, taking their stand at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, and their sons and their little ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Moses said: “By this <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these deeds, that it is not of my own heart:</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">If it is according to the death of all mankind that these people will die and with the punishment of all mankind that punishment will be brought upon them, then it is not Jehovah that has sent me.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But if it is something created that Jehovah will create, and the ground has to open its mouth and swallow up them and everything that belongs to them and they have to go down alive into She&acute;ol, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will then know for certain that these men have treated Jehovah disrespectfully.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And it came about that as soon as he had finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them began to be split apart.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the earth proceeded to open its mouth and to swallow up them and their households and all humankind that belonged to Ko&acute;rah and all the goods.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So down they went, and all who belonged to them, alive into She&acute;ol, and the earth went covering them over, so that they perished from the midst of the congregation.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And all the Israelites who were round about them fled at the screaming of them, for they began to say: “We are afraid that the earth may swallow us up!”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And a fire came out from Jehovah and proceeded to consume the two hundred and fifty men offering the incense.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“Say to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Aaron the priest that he should take up the fire holders from within the conflagration, ‘And you scatter the fire over there; for they are holy,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">even the fire holders of these men who sinned against their own souls. And they must make them into thin metal plates as an overlaying for the altar, because they presented them before Jehovah, so that they became holy; and they should serve as a sign to the sons of Israel.’”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Accordingly El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest took the copper fire holders, which those who had been burned up had presented, and they proceeded to beat them out into an overlaying for the altar,</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">as a memorial for the sons of Israel, to the end that no strange man who is not of the offspring of Aaron should come near to make incense smoke before Jehovah, and no one might become like Ko&acute;rah and his assembly, just as Jehovah had spoken to him by means of Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And directly the next day the whole assembly of the sons of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have put Jehovah’s people to death.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And it came about that when the assembly had congregated themselves together against Moses and Aaron, they then turned toward the tent of meeting; and, look! the cloud covered it, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And Moses and Aaron proceeded to come before the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, rise up from the midst of this assembly, that I may exterminate them in an instant.” At this they fell upon their faces.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">After that Moses said to Aaron: “Take the fire holder and put fire from upon the altar in it and put on incense and go to the assembly in a hurry and make atonement for them, because the indignation has gone out from the face of Jehovah. The plague has started!”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Aaron at once took it, just as Moses had spoken, and went running into the midst of the congregation; and, look! the plague had started among the people. So he put the incense on and began making atonement for the people.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And he kept standing between the dead and the living. Eventually the scourge was stopped.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And those dead from the scourge amounted to fourteen thousand seven hundred, aside from those dead on account of Ko&acute;rah.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">When at last Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the scourge had been stopped.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Speak to the sons of Israel and take from them one rod for each paternal house from all their chieftains, by the house of their fathers, twelve rods. You will write the name of each one upon his rod.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Aaron’s name you will write upon Le&acute;vi’s rod, because there is one rod for the head of the house of their fathers.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you must deposit them in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I regularly present myself to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And what must occur is that the man whom I shall choose, his rod will bud, and I shall certainly make subside from against me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their chieftains went giving him a rod for each chieftain, a rod for each chieftain, by the house of their fathers, twelve rods; and Aaron’s rod was in among their rods.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Moses deposited the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the Testimony.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about the next day that when Moses went into the tent of the Testimony, look! Aaron’s rod for the house of Le&acute;vi had budded, and it was bringing forth buds and blossoming flowers and was bearing ripe almonds.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Moses then brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel, and they went looking and taking each man his own rod.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Subsequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Put Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony as something to be kept for a sign to the sons of rebelliousness, that their murmurings may cease from against me, that they may not die.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At once Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the sons of Israel began to say this to Moses: “Now we are bound to expire, we are bound to perish, we are all of us bound to perish.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Anyone approaching, coming near to Jehovah’s tabernacle, will die! Must we end up in expiring that way?”</span>

       <span id="vs5">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> obligation to the holy place and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> obligation to the altar, that no further indignation may occur against the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I, look!

</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jehovah spoke further to Aaron: “As for me, look! I have given you the custody of the contributions made to me. Of all the holy things of the sons of Israel I have given them to you and to your sons as a portion, as an allowance to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">This should become yours out of the most holy things, out of the offering made by fire, every offering of theirs together with every grain offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs, which they will return to me.

       <span id="vs10">In a most holy place you should eat it. Every male should eat it. It should become something holy to you.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And this belongs to you: the contribution of their gift together with all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as an allowance to time indefinite. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“All the best of the oil and all the best of the new wine and the grain, their firstfruits, which they will give to Jehovah, I have given them to you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">The first ripe fruits of all that is on their land, which they will bring to Jehovah, yours it should become. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

       <span id="vs15">“Everything opening the womb, of every sort of flesh, which they will present to Jehovah, among man and among beast, should become yours.

       <span id="vs16">And with a redemption price for it from a month old onward you should redeem it, by the estimated value, five silver shekels by the shekel of the holy place. It is twenty ge&acute;rahs.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Only the firstborn bull or firstborn male lamb or firstborn goat you should not redeem. They are something holy.

       <span id="vs18">And their flesh should become yours. Like the breast of the wave offering and like the right leg, it should become yours.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">All the holy contributions, which the sons of Israel will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as an allowance to time indefinite.

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“And to the sons of Le&acute;vi, look! I have given every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance in return for their service that they are carrying on, the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the sons of Israel should no more come near to the tent of meeting to incur sin so as to die.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the Levites themselves must carry on the service of the tent of meeting, and they are the ones who should answer for their error. It is a statute to time indefinite during <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations that in the midst of the sons of Israel they should not get possession of an inheritance.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For the tenth part of the sons of Israel, which they will contribute to Jehovah as a contribution, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance. That is why I have said to them, ‘In the midst of the sons of Israel they should not get possession of an inheritance.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“And you should speak to the Levites, and you must say to them, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will receive from the sons of Israel the tenth part that I have given to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from them for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> inheritance, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must contribute from it as a contribution to Jehovah a tenth part of the tenth part.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And it must be reckoned to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> contribution, like the grain of the threshing floor and like the full produce of the wine or oil press.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In this way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves also will contribute a contribution to Jehovah from all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tenth parts that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will receive from the sons of Israel, and from them <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must give the contribution to Jehovah to Aaron the priest.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">From all the gifts to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will contribute every sort of contribution to Jehovah, of the very best of it, as some holy thing from them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“And you must say to them, ‘When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> contribute the best of them, then it will certainly be reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the wine or oil press.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must eat it in every place, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> household, because it is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wages in return for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> service in the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not incur sin for it when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> contribute the best from them, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not die.’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is a statute of the law that Jehovah has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel that they should take for you a sound red cow in which there is no defect and upon which no yoke has come.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must give it to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest, and he must lead it forth outside the camp, and it must be slaughtered before him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest must take some of its blood with his finger and spatter some of its blood straight toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the cow must be burned under his eyes. Its skin and its flesh and its blood together with its dung will be burned.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the priest must take cedarwood and hyssop and coccus scarlet material and throw it into the midst of the burning of the cow.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the priest must wash his garments and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp; but the priest must be unclean until the evening.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘And the one who burned it will wash his garments in water and must bathe his flesh in water, and he must be unclean until the evening.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“‘And a clean man must gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place; and they must serve the assembly of the sons of Israel as something to be kept for the water for cleansing. It is a sin offering.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the one gathering the ashes of the cow must wash his garments and be unclean until the evening.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs10-2">“‘And it must serve the sons of Israel and the alien resident who is residing as an alien in their midst as a statute to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Anyone touching the corpse of any human soul must also be unclean seven days.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Such one should purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean. But if he will not purify himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he will not be clean.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Everyone touching a corpse, the soul of whatever man may die, and who will not purify himself, has defiled Jehovah’s tabernacle, and that soul must be cut off from Israel. Because the water for cleansing has not been sprinkled upon him, he continues unclean. His uncleanness is still upon him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘This is the law in case a man should die in a tent: Everyone coming into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, will be unclean seven days.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And every opened vessel upon which there is no lid tied down is unclean.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And everyone who on the open field may touch someone slain with the sword or a corpse or a bone of a man or a burial place will be unclean seven days.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they must take for the unclean one some of the dust of the burning of the sin offering and put running water upon it in a vessel.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then a clean man must take hyssop and dip it into the water and spatter it upon the tent and all the vessels and the souls that happened to be there and upon the one who touched the bone or the slain one or the corpse or the burial place.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the clean person must spatter it upon the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day and must purify him from sin on the seventh day; and he must wash his garments and bathe in water, and he must be clean in the evening.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“‘But the man who may be unclean and who will not purify himself, well, that soul must be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because it is Jehovah’s sanctuary that he has defiled. The water for cleansing was not sprinkled upon him. He is unclean.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“‘And it must serve as a statute to time indefinite for them, that the one spattering the water for cleansing should wash his garments, also the one touching the water for cleansing. He will be unclean until the evening.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And anything the unclean one may touch will be unclean, and the soul who touches it will be unclean until the evening.’”</span>

<p class="title">Numbers 20:1-29</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="29">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the sons of Israel, the entire assembly, proceeded to come into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people took up dwelling in Ka&acute;desh. It was there that Mir&acute;i&middot;am died and there that she was buried.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Now there proved to be no water for the assembly, and they began to congregate themselves against Moses and Aaron.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the people went quarreling with Moses and saying: “If only we had expired when our brothers expired before Jehovah!</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men brought Jehovah’s congregation into this wilderness for us and our beasts of burden to die there?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> conducted us up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is no place of seed and figs and vines and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Moses and Aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell upon their faces, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Take the rod and call the assembly together, you and Aaron your brother, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must speak to the crag before their eyes that it may indeed give its water; and you must bring out water for them from the crag and give the assembly and their beasts of burden drink.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, just as he had commanded him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">After that Moses and Aaron called the congregation together before the crag, and he proceeded to say to them: “Hear, now, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rebels! Is it from this crag that we shall bring out water for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">With that Moses lifted his hand up and struck the crag with his rod twice; and much water began to come out, and the assembly and their beasts of burden began to drink.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Later Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: “Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not show faith in me to sanctify me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not bring this congregation into the land that I shall certainly give them.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">These are the waters of Mer&acute;i&middot;bah, because the sons of Israel quarreled with Jehovah, so that he was sanctified among them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Subsequently Moses sent messengers from Ka&acute;desh to the king of E&acute;dom: “This is what your brother Israel has said, ‘You yourself well know all the hardship that has overtaken us.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And our fathers proceeded to go down to Egypt, and we continued to dwell in Egypt many days; and the Egyptians began doing harm to us and our fathers.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Finally we cried out to Jehovah and he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and here we are in Ka&acute;desh, a city at the extremity of your territory.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Let us pass, please, through your land. We shall not pass through a field or a vineyard, and we shall not drink the water of a well. On the king’s road we shall march. We shall not bend toward the right or the left, until we shall pass through your territory.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">However, E&acute;dom said to him: “You must not pass through me, for fear I may come out with the sword to meet you.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In turn the sons of Israel said to him: “By the highway we shall go up; and if I and my livestock should drink your water, I shall also certainly give the value of it. I want nothing more than to pass through on my feet.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Still he said: “You must not pass through.” With that E&acute;dom came on out to encounter him with a great many people and a strong hand.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So E&acute;dom refused to grant Israel to pass through his territory. Hence Israel turned away from him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the sons of Israel, the entire assembly, proceeded to pull away from Ka&acute;desh and come to Mount Hor.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then Jehovah said this to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of E&acute;dom:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Aaron will be gathered to his people, for he will not enter into the land that I shall certainly give to the sons of Israel, on the ground that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men rebelled against my order respecting the waters of Mer&acute;i&middot;bah.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Take Aaron and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar his son and bring them up into Mount Hor.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And strip Aaron of his garments, and you must clothe with them El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar his son; and Aaron will be gathered and must die there.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded; and before the eyes of all the assembly they went climbing Mount Hor.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and clothed El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar his son with them, after which Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar came on down from the mountain.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And all the assembly got to see that Aaron had expired, and all the house of Israel continued weeping for Aaron thirty days.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ite the king of A&acute;rad, who dwelt in the Neg&acute;eb, got to hear that Israel had come by the way of Ath&acute;a&middot;rim, and he began to fight with Israel and carry away some of them as captives.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Consequently Israel made a vow to Jehovah and said: “If you will without fail give this people into my hand, I shall also certainly devote their cities to destruction.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Jehovah listened to Israel’s voice and gave the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites over; and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. Hence they called the name of the place Hor&acute;mah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">While they continued trekking from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea to go around the land of E&acute;dom, the soul of the people began tiring out because of the way.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the people kept speaking against God and Moses: “Why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread and no water, and our soul has come to abhor the contemptible bread.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Jehovah sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they kept biting the people, so that many people of Israel died.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Finally the people came to Moses and said: “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah and against you. Intercede with Jehovah that he may remove the serpents from upon us.” And Moses went interceding in behalf of the people.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Make for yourself a fiery snake and place it upon a signal pole. And it must occur that when anyone has been bitten, he then has to look at it and so must keep alive.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Moses at once made a serpent of copper and placed it upon the signal pole; and it did occur that if a serpent had bitten a man and he gazed at the copper serpent, he then kept alive.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">After that the sons of Israel pulled away and encamped in O&acute;both.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then they pulled away from O&acute;both and encamped in I&acute;ye-ab&acute;a&middot;rim, in the wilderness that is toward the front of Mo&acute;ab, toward the rising of the sun.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">From there they pulled away and took up camping by the torrent valley of Ze&acute;red.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">From there they pulled away and went camping in the region of the Ar&acute;non, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites; for the Ar&acute;non is the boundary of Mo&acute;ab, between Mo&acute;ab and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">That is why it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah:</span>

       <span id="vs14-2">“Va&acute;heb in Su&acute;phah and the torrent valleys of Ar&acute;non,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and the mouth of the torrent valleys, which has bent itself toward the seat of Ar and has leaned against the border of Mo&acute;ab.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Next from there on to Be&acute;er. This is the well about which Jehovah said to Moses: “Gather the people, and let me give them water.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At that time Israel proceeded to sing this song:<br><span class="p">“Spring up, O well! Respond to it, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people!</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">A well, princes dug it. The nobles of the people excavated it,<br><span class="z">With a commander’s staff, with their own staffs.”</span></span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs18-3">Then from the wilderness on to Mat&acute;ta&middot;nah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And from Mat&acute;ta&middot;nah on to Na&middot;hal&acute;i&middot;el, and from Na&middot;hal&acute;i&middot;el on to Ba&acute;moth.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And from Ba&acute;moth on to the valley that is in the field of Mo&acute;ab, at the head of Pis&acute;gah, and it projects over toward the face of Je&middot;shi&acute;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Israel now sent messengers to Si&acute;hon the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, saying:</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Let me pass through your land. We shall not turn off into a field or a vineyard. We shall drink water of no well. On the king’s road we shall march until we pass through your territory.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And Si&acute;hon did not allow Israel to pass through his territory, but Si&acute;hon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel in the wilderness, and came to Ja&acute;haz and began fighting with Israel.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At that Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Ar&acute;non to the Jab&acute;bok, near the sons of Am&acute;mon; because Ja&acute;zer is the border of the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So Israel took all these cities, and Israel began dwelling in all the cities of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, in Hesh&acute;bon and all its dependent towns.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For Hesh&acute;bon was the city of Si&acute;hon. He was the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, and it was he who fought with the king of Mo&acute;ab formerly and went taking all his land out of his hand as far as the Ar&acute;non.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">That is why the sayers of mock verses would say:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs27-2">“Come to Hesh&acute;bon.<br><span class="z">Let the city of Si&acute;hon be built and be proved firmly set up.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">For a fire has come out of Hesh&acute;bon, a flame from the town of Si&acute;hon.<br><span class="z">It has consumed Ar of Mo&acute;ab, the owners of the high places of the Ar&acute;non.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Woe to you, Mo&acute;ab! You will certainly perish, O people of Che&acute;mosh!<br><span class="z">He will certainly give his sons as escaped ones and his daughters in the captivity to the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, Si&acute;hon.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So let us shoot at them.<br><span class="z">Hesh&acute;bon will certainly perish up to Di&acute;bon,</span><br><span class="z">And the women up to No&acute;phah, the men up to Med&acute;e&middot;ba.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Israel began to dwell in the land of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then Moses sent some to spy on Ja&acute;zer. So they captured its dependent towns and dispossessed the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were there.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">After that they turned and went up by the way of Ba&acute;shan. At this Og the king of Ba&acute;shan came out to meet them, he and all his people, to the battle of Ed&acute;re&middot;i.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Do not be afraid of him, for into your hand I shall certainly give him and all his people and his land; and you must do to him just as you did to Si&acute;hon, the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, who used to dwell in Hesh&acute;bon.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">So they went striking him and his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor remaining to him; and they went taking possession of his land.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="41">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then the sons of Israel pulled away and encamped on the desert plains of Mo&acute;ab across the Jordan from Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Ba&acute;lak the son of Zip&acute;por got to see all that Israel had done to the Am&acute;or&middot;ites.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Mo&acute;ab became very frightened at the people, because they were many; and Mo&acute;ab began to feel a sickening dread of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Mo&acute;ab proceeded to say to the older men of Mid&acute;i&middot;an: “Now this congregation will lick up all our surroundings like the bull licking up the green growth of the field.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">And Ba&acute;lak the son of Zip&acute;por was king of Mo&acute;ab at that particular time.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">He now sent messengers to Ba&acute;laam the son of Be&acute;or at Pe&acute;thor, which is by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying: “Look! A people has come out of Egypt. Look! They have covered the earth as far as one can see, and they are dwelling right in front of me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And now do come, please; do curse this people for me, for they are mightier than I am. Perhaps I may be able to strike them and I may drive them out of the land; for I well know that the one whom you bless is a blessed one and the one whom you curse is cursed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So the older men of Mo&acute;ab and the older men of Mid&acute;i&middot;an traveled with the payments for divination in their hands and went to Ba&acute;laam and spoke to him Ba&acute;lak’s words.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that he said to them: “Lodge here tonight, and I shall certainly return <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> word just as Jehovah may speak to me.” Accordingly the princes of Mo&acute;ab stayed with Ba&acute;laam.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then God came to Ba&acute;laam and said: “Who are these men with you?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So Ba&acute;laam said to the [true] God: “Ba&acute;lak the son of Zip&acute;por, the king of Mo&acute;ab, has sent to me, saying,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">‘Look! The people who are coming out of Egypt, and they go covering the earth as far as the eye can see. Now do come, do execrate them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and I shall actually drive them out.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But God said to Ba&acute;laam: “You must not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After that Ba&acute;laam got up in the morning and said to the princes of Ba&acute;lak: “Go to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> country, because Jehovah has refused to let me go with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So the princes of Mo&acute;ab got up and came to Ba&acute;lak and said: “Ba&acute;laam has refused to come with us.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, Ba&acute;lak sent again other princes in greater number and more honorable than the former.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In turn they came to Ba&acute;laam and said to him: “This is what Ba&acute;lak the son of Zip&acute;por has said, ‘Do not be detained, please, from coming to me.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For I shall without fail honor you greatly, and everything you may say to me I shall do. So do come, please. Do execrate this people for me.’”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But Ba&acute;laam answered and said to the servants of Ba&acute;lak: “If Ba&acute;lak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I should not be able to pass beyond the order of Jehovah my God, so as to do something small or great.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men also stay here, please, tonight that I may know what further Jehovah will speak with me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then God came to Ba&acute;laam by night and said to him: “If it is to call you that the men have come, get up, go with them. But only the word that I shall speak to you is what you may speak.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that Ba&acute;laam got up in the morning and saddled his she-ass and went with the princes of Mo&acute;ab.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the anger of God began to blaze because he was going; and Jehovah’s angel proceeded to station himself in the road to resist him. And he was riding upon his she-ass, and two attendants of his were with him.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the ass got to see Jehovah’s angel stationed in the road with his drawn sword in his hand; and the ass tried to turn aside from the road that she might go into the field, but Ba&acute;laam began to strike the ass in order to turn her aside to the road.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Jehovah’s angel kept standing in the narrow way between the vineyards, with a stone wall on this side and a stone wall on that side.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the she-ass kept seeing Jehovah’s angel and began to squeeze herself against the wall and so to squeeze Ba&acute;laam’s foot against the wall; and he went beating her some more.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Jehovah’s angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside to the right or the left.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">When the ass got to see Jehovah’s angel she now lay down under Ba&acute;laam; so that Ba&acute;laam’s anger blazed, and he kept beating the ass with his staff.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Finally Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass and she said to Ba&acute;laam: “What have I done to you so that you have beaten me these three times?”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">At this Ba&acute;laam said to the ass: “It is because you have dealt ruthlessly with me. If only there were a sword in my hand, for now I should have killed you!”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then the she-ass said to Ba&acute;laam: “Am I not your she-ass that you have ridden upon all your life long until this day? Have I ever been used to do to you this way?” To which he said: “No!”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Jehovah proceeded to uncover Ba&acute;laam’s eyes, so that he saw Jehovah’s angel stationed in the road with his drawn sword in his hand. At once he bowed low and prostrated himself on his face.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then Jehovah’s angel said to him: “Why have you beaten your she-ass these three times? Look! I—I have come out to offer resistance, because your way has been headlong against my will.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the she-ass got to see me and tried to turn aside before me these three times. Supposing she had not turned aside from before me! For by now even you I should have killed, but her I should have preserved alive.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">At this Ba&acute;laam said to Jehovah’s angel: “I have sinned, because I did not know that it was you stationed in the road to meet me. And now, if it is bad in your eyes, let me go my way back.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">But Jehovah’s angel said to Ba&acute;laam: “Go with the men; and nothing but the word that I shall speak to you is what you may speak.” And Ba&acute;laam continued going with the princes of Ba&acute;lak.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">When Ba&acute;lak got to hear that Ba&acute;laam had come, he at once went out to meet him at the city of Mo&acute;ab, which is on the bank of the Ar&acute;non, which is on the extremity of the territory.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Then Ba&acute;lak said to Ba&acute;laam: “Have I not for a fact sent to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not really and truly able to honor you?”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">At this Ba&acute;laam said to Ba&acute;lak: “Here I have come to you now. Shall I be able at all to speak something? The word that God will place in my mouth is what I shall speak.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So Ba&acute;laam went with Ba&acute;lak and they came to Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-hu&acute;zoth.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And Ba&acute;lak proceeded to sacrifice cattle and sheep and to send some to Ba&acute;laam and the princes who were with him.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And it came about in the morning that Ba&acute;lak went taking Ba&acute;laam and bringing him up to Ba&acute;moth-ba&acute;al, that he might see from there the whole of the people.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then Ba&acute;laam said to Ba&acute;lak: “Build for me on this spot seven altars and make ready for me on this spot seven bulls and seven rams.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Ba&acute;lak immediately did just as Ba&acute;laam had spoken. After that Ba&acute;lak and Ba&acute;laam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Ba&acute;laam went on to say to Ba&acute;lak: “Station yourself by your burnt offering, and let me go. Perhaps Jehovah will get in touch and meet with me. In that case whatever he will show me, I shall certainly tell you.” So he went to a bare hill.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When God got in touch with Ba&acute;laam, he then said to Him: “I set the seven altars in rows, and I proceeded to offer up a bull and a ram on each altar.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly Jehovah put a word in the mouth of Ba&acute;laam and said: “Return to Ba&acute;lak, and this is what you will speak.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So he returned to him, and, look! he and all the princes of Mo&acute;ab were stationed by his burnt offering.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then he took up his proverbial utterance and said:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs7-2">“From A&acute;ram Ba&acute;lak the king of Mo&acute;ab tried to conduct me,<br><span class="z">From the mountains of the east:</span><br><span class="p">‘Do come, do curse Jacob for me.</span><br><span class="z">Yes, do come, do denounce Israel.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">How could I execrate those whom God has not execrated?<br><span class="z">And how could I denounce those whom Jehovah has not denounced?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For from the top of the rocks I see them,<br><span class="z">And from the hills I behold them.</span><br><span class="p">There as a people they keep tabernacling isolated,</span><br><span class="z">And among the nations they do not reckon themselves.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Who has numbered the dust particles of Jacob,<br><span class="z">And who has counted the fourth part of Israel?</span><br><span class="p">Let my soul die the death of the upright ones,</span><br><span class="z">And let my end turn out afterward like theirs.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At this Ba&acute;lak said to Ba&acute;laam: “What have you done to me? It was in order to execrate my enemies that I took you, and here you have blessed them to the limit.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">In turn he answered and said: “Is it not whatever Jehovah may put in my mouth that I should take care to speak?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Ba&acute;lak said to him: “Do come, please, with me to another place from which you can see them. Only the extremity of them you will see, and you will not see all of them. And execrate them for me from there.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So he took him to the field of Zo&acute;phim, to the top of Pis&acute;gah, and proceeded to build seven altars and to offer up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that he said to Ba&acute;lak: “Station yourself here by your burnt offering, and, as for me, let me get in touch with him there.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Subsequently Jehovah got in touch with Ba&acute;laam and put a word in his mouth and said: “Return to Ba&acute;lak, and this is what you will speak.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So he came to him, and, look! he was stationed by his burnt offering, and the princes of Mo&acute;ab with him. Then Ba&acute;lak said to him: “What has Jehovah spoken?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At this he took up his proverbial utterance and said:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs18-2">“Get up, Ba&acute;lak, and listen.<br><span class="z">Do give ear to me, O son of Zip&acute;por.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">God is not a man that he should tell lies,<br><span class="z">Neither a son of mankind that he should feel regret.</span><br><span class="p">Has he himself said it and will he not do it,</span><br><span class="z">And has he spoken and will he not carry it out?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Look! I have been taken to bless,<br><span class="z">And He has blessed, and I shall not reverse it.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">He has not looked upon any uncanny power against Jacob,<br><span class="z">And no trouble has he seen against Israel.</span><br><span class="p">Jehovah his God is with him,</span><br><span class="z">And the loud hailing of a king is in his midst.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">God is bringing them out of Egypt.<br><span class="z">The swift course like that of a wild bull is his.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For there is no unlucky spell against Jacob,<br><span class="z">Nor any divination against Israel.</span><br><span class="p">At this time it may be said respecting Jacob and Israel,</span><br><span class="z">‘What has God worked out!’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Behold, a people will get up like a lion,<br><span class="z">And like the lion it will lift itself up.</span><br><span class="p">It will not lie down until it may eat prey,</span><br><span class="z">And the blood of slain ones it will drink.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At this Ba&acute;lak said to Ba&acute;laam: “If, on the one hand, you cannot execrate him at all, then, on the other hand, you should not bless him at all.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In turn Ba&acute;laam answered and said to Ba&acute;lak: “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘All that Jehovah will speak is what I shall do’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then Ba&acute;lak said to Ba&acute;laam: “O come, please. Let me take you to still another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the [true] God so that you will certainly execrate him for me from there.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">With that Ba&acute;lak took Ba&acute;laam to the top of Pe&acute;or, which looks toward Je&middot;shi&acute;mon.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then Ba&acute;laam said to Ba&acute;lak: “Build for me on this spot seven altars and make ready for me on this spot seven bulls and seven rams.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So Ba&acute;lak did just as Ba&acute;laam had said, and he went offering up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now Israel was dwelling in Shit&acute;tim. Then the people started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Mo&acute;ab.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the women came calling the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Israel attached itself to the Ba&acute;al of Pe&acute;or; and the anger of Jehovah began to blaze against Israel.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Hence Jehovah said to Moses: “Take all the head ones of the people and expose them to Jehovah toward the sun, that the burning anger of Jehovah may turn back from Israel.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Moses said to the judges of Israel: “Each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kill his men who have an attachment with the Ba&acute;al of Pe&acute;or.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But, look! a man of the sons of Israel came, and he was bringing near to his brothers a Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ite woman before Moses’ eyes and before the eyes of all the assembly of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">When Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Aaron the priest caught sight of it, he at once got up from the midst of the assembly and took a lance in his hand.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then he went after the man of Israel into the vaulted tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman through her genital parts. At that the scourge was halted from upon the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And those who died from the scourge amounted to twenty-four thousand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Aaron the priest has turned back my wrath from upon the sons of Israel by his tolerating no rivalry at all toward me in the midst of them, so that I have not exterminated the sons of Israel in my insistence on exclusive devotion.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For that reason say, ‘Here I am giving him my covenant of peace.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it must serve as the covenant of a priesthood to time indefinite for him and his offspring after him, due to the fact that he tolerated no rivalry toward his God and proceeded to make atonement for the sons of Israel.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Incidentally the name of the fatally struck Israelite man who was fatally struck with the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;i&middot;tess was Zim&acute;ri the son of Sa&acute;lu, a chieftain of a paternal house of the Sim&acute;e&middot;on&middot;ites.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the name of the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ite woman fatally struck was Coz&acute;bi the daughter of Zur; he was a head one of the clans of a paternal house in Mid&acute;i&middot;an.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Later Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Let there be a harassing of the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ites, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men must strike them,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">because they are harassing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with their deeds of cunning that they committed against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cunningly in the affair of Pe&acute;or and in the affair of Coz&acute;bi the daughter of a chieftain of Mid&acute;i&middot;an, their sister who was fatally struck in the day of the scourge over the affair of Pe&acute;or.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then the daughters of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had the son of He&acute;pher the son of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad the son of Ma&acute;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, of the families of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh the son of Joseph, came near. And these were the names of his daughters: Mah&acute;lah, Noah and Hog&acute;lah and Mil&acute;cah and Tir&acute;zah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And they proceeded to stand before Moses and before El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and before the chieftains and all the assembly at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“Our father has died in the wilderness, and yet he did not prove to be in among the assembly, that is, those who ranged themselves against Jehovah in the assembly of Ko&acute;rah, but for his own sin he has died; and he did not get to have any sons.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Why should the name of our father be taken away from the midst of his family because he had no son? O give us a possession in the midst of our father’s brothers.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At that Moses presented their case before Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Jehovah then said this to Moses:</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“The daughters of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had are speaking right. By all means you should give them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of their father’s brothers, and you must cause their father’s inheritance to pass to them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And to the sons of Israel you should speak, saying, ‘In case any man should die without his having a son, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And if he has no daughter, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And if he has no brothers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And if his father has no brothers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then give his inheritance to his blood relation who is closest to him of his family, and he must take possession of it. And it must serve as a statute by judicial decision for the sons of Israel, just as Jehovah has commanded Moses.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Subsequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Go up into this mountain of Ab&acute;a&middot;rim and see the land that I shall certainly give the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">When you have seen it, then you must be gathered to your people, yes, you, just as Aaron your brother was gathered,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">inasmuch as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men rebelled against my order in the wilderness of Zin at the quarreling of the assembly, in relation to sanctifying me by the waters before their eyes. These are the waters of Mer&acute;i&middot;bah at Ka&acute;desh in the wilderness of Zin.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Let Jehovah the God of the spirits of all sorts of flesh appoint over the assembly a man</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">who will go out before them and who will come in before them and who will bring them out and who will bring them in, that Jehovah’s assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So Jehovah said to Moses: “Take for yourself Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom there is spirit, and you must lay your hand upon him;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and you must stand him before El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and before all the assembly, and you must commission him before their eyes.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And you must put some of your dignity upon him, in order that all the assembly of the sons of Israel may listen to him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And it is before El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest that he will stand, and he must inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the U&acute;rim before Jehovah. At his order they will go out and at his order they will come in, he and all the sons of Israel with him and all the assembly.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Moses proceeded to do just as Jehovah had commanded him. Accordingly he took Joshua and stood him before El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and before all the assembly</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and laid his hands upon him and commissioned him, just as Jehovah had spoken by means of Moses.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Jehovah then spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Take vengeance for the sons of Israel upon the Mid&acute;i&middot;an&middot;ites. Afterward you will be gathered to your people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Moses spoke to the people, saying: “Equip men from among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for the army, that they may serve against Mid&acute;i&middot;an to execute Jehovah’s vengeance upon Mid&acute;i&middot;an.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">A thousand of each tribe of all the tribes of Israel <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will send into the army.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly from the thousands of Israel a thousand were assigned of a tribe, twelve thousand equipped for the army.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Moses sent them out, a thousand of each tribe, to the army, them and Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest to the army, and the holy utensils and the trumpets for blowing calls were in his hand.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they went waging war against Mid&acute;i&middot;an, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and they proceeded to kill every male.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And they killed the kings of Mid&acute;i&middot;an along with the others slain, namely, E&acute;vi and Re&acute;kem and Zur and Hur and Re&acute;ba, the five kings of Mid&acute;i&middot;an; and they killed Ba&acute;laam the son of Be&acute;or with the sword.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But the sons of Israel carried off the women of Mid&acute;i&middot;an and their little ones captive; and all their domestic animals and all their livestock and all their means of maintenance they plundered.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And all their cities in which they had settled and all their walled camps they burned with fire.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they went taking all the spoil and all the booty in the way of humans and domestic animals.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And they came bringing to Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and to the assembly of the sons of Israel the captives and the booty and the spoil, to the camp, to the desert plains of Mo&acute;ab, which are by the Jordan at Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and all the chieftains of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Moses grew indignant at the appointed men of the combat forces, the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds who were coming in from the military expedition.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So Moses said to them: “Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> preserved alive every female?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Look! They are the ones who, by Ba&acute;laam’s word, served to induce the sons of Israel to commit unfaithfulness toward Jehovah over the affair of Pe&acute;or, so that the scourge came upon the assembly of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And now kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has had intercourse with man by lying with a male.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And preserve alive for yourselves all the little ones among the women who have not known the act of lying with a male.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves, camp outside the camp seven days. Everyone who has killed a soul and everyone who has touched someone slain, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> captives.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And every garment and every article of skin and everything made of goat’s hair and every article of wood <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should purify for yourselves from sin.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest then said to the men of the army who had gone into the battle: “This is the statute of the law that Jehovah commanded Moses,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">‘Only the gold and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin and the lead,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">everything that is processed with fire, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should pass through the fire, and it must be clean. Only it should be purified by the water for cleansing. And everything that is not processed with fire <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should pass through the water.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must wash <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may come into the camp.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Jehovah proceeded to say this to Moses:</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Take the sum of the booty, the captives both of humankind and of domestic animals, you and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the assembly.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And you must divide the booty in two between those taking part in the battle who went out on the expedition and all the rest of the assembly.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And as a tax for Jehovah you must take away from the men of war who went out on the expedition one soul out of five hundred, of humankind and of the herd and of the asses and of the flock.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">From their half <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should take it and you must give it to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest as Jehovah’s contribution.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And from the half of the sons of Israel you should take one out of fifty, of humankind, of the herd, of the asses and of the flock, of every sort of domestic animal, and you must give them to the Levites, the keepers of the obligation of Jehovah’s tabernacle.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest went doing just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the booty, the rest of the plunder that the people of the expedition had taken as plunder, amounted to six hundred and seventy-five thousand of the flock,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">and seventy-two thousand of the herd,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">and sixty-one thousand asses.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">As for human souls from the women who had not known the act of lying with a male, all the souls were thirty-two thousand.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And the half that was the share of those who went out on the expedition amounted in number to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred of the flock.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And the tax for Jehovah from the flock amounted to six hundred and seventy-five.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And of the herd there were thirty-six thousand, and the tax on them for Jehovah was seventy-two.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And the asses were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tax on them for Jehovah was sixty-one.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And the human souls were sixteen thousand, and the tax on them for Jehovah was thirty-two souls.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Then Moses gave the tax as Jehovah’s contribution to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And from the half belonging to the sons of Israel, which Moses divided from that belonging to the men who waged war:</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Now the half of the assembly from the flock amounted to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">and of the herd, thirty-six thousand,</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">and the asses, thirty thousand five hundred,</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">and human souls, sixteen thousand.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Then Moses took from the half belonging to the sons of Israel the one to be taken out of fifty, of humankind and of domestic animals, and gave them to the Levites, the keepers of the obligation of Jehovah’s tabernacle, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And the appointed men who were of the thousands of the army, the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds, proceeded to approach Moses,</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">and to say to Moses: “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are in our charge and not one has been reported missing from us.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">So let us present each one what he has found as Jehovah’s offering, articles of gold, ankle chainlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and female ornaments, in order to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">Accordingly Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest accepted the gold from them, all the jewelry.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And all the gold of the contribution that they contributed to Jehovah amounted to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">The men of the army had taken plunder each for himself.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">So Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest accepted the gold from the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.</span>

<p class="title">Numbers 32:1-42</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="42">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad had come to have numerous livestock, very many, in fact. And they began to see the land of Ja&acute;zer and the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad, and, look! the place was a place for livestock.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Hence the sons of Gad and the sons of Reu&acute;ben came and said this to Moses and El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and to the chieftains of the assembly:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“At&acute;a&middot;roth and Di&acute;bon and Ja&acute;zer and Nim&acute;rah and Hesh&acute;bon and E&middot;le&middot;a&acute;leh and Se&acute;bam and Ne&acute;bo and Be&acute;on,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">the land that Jehovah defeated before the assembly of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And they went on to say: “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Reu&acute;ben: “Are <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers to go to war while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves keep dwelling here?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And why should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> dishearten the sons of Israel from crossing into the land that Jehovah will certainly give them?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">That is the way <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers did when I sent them from Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a to see the land.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When they went up to the torrent valley of Esh&acute;col and saw the land, then they disheartened the sons of Israel, so as not to go into the land that Jehovah was certain to give them.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Consequently Jehovah’s anger blazed on that day so that he swore, saying,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">‘The men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old upward will not see the soil of which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, because they have not followed me wholly,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">except Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh the Ken&acute;iz&middot;zite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have followed Jehovah wholly.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that was doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah came to their end.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And here <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have risen in the place of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers as the brood of sinful men in order to add further to the burning anger of Jehovah against Israel.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should turn back from following him, he also would certainly once again let them stay longer in the wilderness, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would have acted ruinously toward all this people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Later they approached him and said: “Let us build here stone flock pens for our livestock and cities for our little ones.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But we ourselves shall go equipped in battle formation before the sons of Israel until whenever we have brought them to their place, while our little ones must dwell in the cities with fortifications away from the face of the inhabitants of the land.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">We shall not return to our houses until the sons of Israel have provided themselves with landed property, each with his own inheritance.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For we shall not get an inheritance with them from the side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us from the side of the Jordan toward the sunrising.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">At this Moses said to them: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will do this thing, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will equip yourselves before Jehovah for the war,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and every equipped one of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> will actually pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he drives away his enemies from before him,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">and the land is actually subdued before Jehovah, and afterward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> return, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also will indeed prove yourselves free from guilt against Jehovah and against Israel; and this land must become <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> as a possession before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not do this way, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will also certainly sin against Jehovah. In that case know that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sin will catch up with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Build for yourselves cities for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones and stone pens for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flocks, and what has gone forth from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mouth <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should do.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then the sons of Gad and the sons of Reu&acute;ben said this to Moses: “Your servants will do just as my lord is commanding.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Our little ones, our wives, our livestock and all our domestic animals will stay there in the cities of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">but your servants will pass over, everyone equipped for the army, before Jehovah for the war, just as my lord is speaking.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Accordingly Moses gave a command respecting them to El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">So Moses said to them: “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reu&acute;ben pass with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> over the Jordan, everyone equipped for the war, before Jehovah, and the land is actually subdued before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then give them the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad as a possession.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But if they do not pass over equipped with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, they must then be settled in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst in the land of Ca&acute;naan.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">To this the sons of Gad and the sons of Reu&acute;ben answered, saying: “What Jehovah has spoken to your servants is the way we shall do.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">We ourselves will pass over equipped before Jehovah to the land of Ca&acute;naan, and the possession of our inheritance will be with us on this side of the Jordan.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">At this Moses gave to them, that is, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reu&acute;ben and to half the tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Si&acute;hon the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the kingdom of Og the king of Ba&acute;shan, the land belonging to its cities in the territories, and the cities of the land round about.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And the sons of Gad proceeded to build Di&acute;bon and At&acute;a&middot;roth and A&middot;ro&acute;er,</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">and At&acute;roth-sho&acute;phan and Ja&acute;zer and Jog&acute;be&middot;hah,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">and Beth-nim&acute;rah and Beth-ha&acute;ran, cities with fortifications, and stone flock pens.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And the sons of Reu&acute;ben built Hesh&acute;bon and E&middot;le&middot;a&acute;leh and Kir&middot;i&middot;a&middot;tha&acute;im,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and Ne&acute;bo and Ba&acute;al-me&acute;on—their names being changed—and Sib&acute;mah; and they began to call by their own names the names of the cities that they built.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And the sons of Ma&acute;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh proceeded to march to Gil&acute;e&middot;ad and to capture it and to drive away the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were in it.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">So Moses gave Gil&acute;e&middot;ad to Ma&acute;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, and he took up dwelling in it.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And Ja&acute;ir the son of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh marched and went capturing their tent villages, and he began to call them Hav&acute;voth-ja&acute;ir.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And No&acute;bah marched and went capturing Ke&acute;nath and its dependent towns; and he began to call it No&acute;bah by his own name.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And the heads of the fathers of the family of the sons of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad the son of Ma&acute;chir the son of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh of the families of the sons of Joseph proceeded to come near and speak before Moses and the chieftains, the heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and say: “Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land in inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had our brother to his daughters.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">If any of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel happened to get them as wives, the women’s inheritance must also be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and must be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they may come to belong, so that it would be withdrawn from the lot of our inheritance.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now if the Jubilee takes place for the sons of Israel, the women’s inheritance must also be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they may come to belong; so that their inheritance would be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”</span>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel at the order of Jehovah, saying: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph is speaking right.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">This is the word that Jehovah has commanded for the daughters of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had, saying, ‘To whom it is good in their eyes they may become wives. Only it is to the family of the tribe of their fathers that they should become wives.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And no inheritance of the sons of Israel should circulate from tribe to tribe, because the sons of Israel should cleave each one to the inheritance of the tribe of his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And every daughter getting possession of an inheritance out of the tribes of the sons of Israel, to one of the family of the tribe of her father she should become a wife, in order that the sons of Israel may get possession each one of the inheritance of his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And no inheritance should circulate from one tribe to another tribe, because the tribes of the sons of Israel should cleave each to its own inheritance.’”</span>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, that is the way the daughters of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had did.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Accordingly Mah&acute;lah, Tir&acute;zah and Hog&acute;lah and Mil&acute;cah and Noah, the daughters of Ze&middot;lo&acute;phe&middot;had, became the wives of the sons of their father’s brothers.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">To some of the families of the sons of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh the son of Joseph they became wives, that their inheritance might continue together with the tribe of the family of their father.</span>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">These are the commandments and the judicial decisions that Jehovah commanded by means of Moses to the sons of Israel on the desert plains of Mo&acute;ab by the Jordan at Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
