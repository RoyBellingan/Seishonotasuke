</br>1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will according to the promise of the life that is in union with Christ Jesus,
</br>2 to Timothy, a beloved child:
<p></p>
May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God [the] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<p></p>
</br>3 I am grateful to God, to whom I am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did and with a clean conscience, that I never leave off remembering you in my supplications, night and day
</br>4 longing to see you, as I remember your tears, that I may get filled with joy.
</br>5 For I recollect the faith which is in you without any hypocrisy, and which dwelt first in your grandmother Lo´is and your mother Eu´nice, but which I am confident is also in you.
<p></p>
</br>6 For this very cause I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you through the laying of my hands upon you.
</br>7 For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.
</br>8 Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord, neither of me a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God.
</br>9 He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not by reason of our works, but by reason of his own purpose and undeserved kindness. This was given us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long lasting,
</br>10 but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death but has shed light upon life and incorruption through the good news,
</br>11 for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher.
<p></p>
</br>12 For this very cause I am also suffering these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the one whom I have believed, and I am confident he is able to guard what I have laid up in trust with him until that day.
</br>13 Keep holding the pattern of healthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus.
</br>14 This fine trust guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us.
<p></p>
</br>15 You know this, that all the men in the [district of] Asia have turned away from me. Phy·gel´us and Her·mog´e·nes are of that number.
</br>16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of On·e·siph´o·rus, because he often brought me refreshment, and he did not become ashamed of my chains.
</br>17 On the contrary, when he happened to be in Rome, he diligently looked for me and found me.
</br>18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from Jehovah in that day. And all the services he rendered in Eph´e·sus you know well enough.

</br>1 You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in connection with Christ Jesus,
</br>2 and the things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.
</br>3 As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus take your part in suffering evil.
</br>4 No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order that he may gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.
</br>5 Moreover, if anyone contends even in the games, he is not crowned unless he has contended according to the rules.
</br>6 The hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits.
</br>7 Give constant thought to what I am saying; the Lord will really give you discernment in all things.
<p></p>
</br>8 Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead and was of David’s seed, according to the good news I preach;
</br>9 in connection with which I am suffering evil to the point of [prison] bonds as an evildoer. Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.
</br>10 On this account I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in union with Christ Jesus along with everlasting glory.
</br>11 Faithful is the saying: Certainly if we died together, we shall also live together;
</br>12 if we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings; if we deny, he also will deny us;
</br>13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
<p></p>
</br>14 Keep reminding them of these things, charging them before God as witness, not to fight about words, a thing of no usefulness at all because it overturns those listening.
</br>15 Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.
</br>16 But shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness,
</br>17 and their word will spread like gangrene. Hy·me·nae´us and Phi·le´tus are of that number.
</br>18 These very [men] have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.
</br>19 For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal: “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and: “Let everyone naming the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Now in a large house there are vessels not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable purpose but others for a purpose lacking honor.
</br>21 If, therefore, anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be a vessel for an honorable purpose, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work.
</br>22 So, flee from the desires incidental to youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.
<p></p>
</br>23 Further, turn down foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing they produce fights.
</br>24 But a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, keeping himself restrained under evil,
</br>25 instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed; as perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth,
</br>26 and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him for the will of that one.

</br>1 But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.
</br>2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,
</br>3 having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,
</br>4 betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God,
</br>5 having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.
</br>6 For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,
</br>7 always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
<p></p>
</br>8 Now in the way that Jan´nes and Jam´bres resisted Moses, so these also go on resisting the truth, men completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith.
</br>9 Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their madness will be very plain to all, even as the [madness] of those [two men] became.
</br>10 But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my long-suffering, my love, my endurance,
</br>11 my persecutions, my sufferings, the sort of things that happened to me in Antioch, in I·co´ni·um, in Lys´tra, the sort of persecutions I have borne; and yet out of them all the Lord delivered me.
</br>12 In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.
</br>13 But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.
<p></p>
</br>14 You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them
</br>15 and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.
</br>16 All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,
</br>17 that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.

</br>1 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is destined to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his kingdom,
</br>2 preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long-suffering and [art of] teaching.
</br>3 For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled;
</br>4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories.
</br>5 You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do [the] work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.
<p></p>
</br>6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the due time for my releasing is imminent.
</br>7 I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.
</br>8 From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not only to me, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.
<p></p>
</br>9 Do your utmost to come to me shortly.
</br>10 For De´mas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thes·sa·lo·ni´ca; Cres´cens to Ga·la´ti·a, Titus to Dal·ma´tia.
</br>11 Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.
</br>12 But I have sent Tych´i·cus off to Eph´e·sus.
</br>13 When you come, bring the cloak I left at Tro´as with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.
<p></p>
</br>14 Alexander the coppersmith did me many injuries—Jehovah will repay him according to his deeds—
</br>15 and you too be on guard against him, for he resisted our words to an excessive degree.
<p></p>
</br>16 In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all proceeded to forsake me—may it not be put to their account—
</br>17 but the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; and I was delivered from the lion’s mouth.
</br>18 The Lord will deliver me from every wicked work and will save [me] for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p></p>
</br>19 Give my greetings to Pris´ca and Aq´ui·la and the household of On·e·siph´o·rus.
<p></p>
</br>20 E·ras´tus stayed in Corinth, but I left Troph´i·mus sick at Mi·le´tus.
</br>21 Do your utmost to arrive before winter.
<p></p>
Eu·bu´lus sends you his greetings, and [so do] Pu´dens and Li´nus and Clau´di·a and all the brothers.
<p></p>
</br>22 The Lord [be] with the spirit you [show]. His undeserved kindness [be] with YOU people.
