</br>1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus under command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope,
</br>2 to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:
<p></p>
May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God [the] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<p></p>
</br>3 Just as I encouraged you to stay in Eph´e·sus when I was about to go my way into Mac·e·do´ni·a, so I do now, that you might command certain ones not to teach different doctrine,
</br>4 nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies, which end up in nothing, but which furnish questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith.
</br>5 Really the objective of this mandate is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.
</br>6 By deviating from these things certain ones have been turned aside into idle talk,
</br>7 wanting to be teachers of law, but not perceiving either the things they are saying or the things about which they are making strong assertions.
<p></p>
</br>8 Now we know that the Law is fine provided one handles it lawfully
</br>9 in the knowledge of this fact, that law is promulgated, not for a righteous man, but for persons lawless and unruly, ungodly and sinners, lacking loving-kindness, and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,
</br>10 fornicators, men who lie with males, kidnappers, liars, false swearers, and whatever other thing is in opposition to the healthful teaching
</br>11 according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.
<p></p>
</br>12 I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry,
</br>13 although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy, because I was ignorant and acted with a lack of faith.
</br>14 But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus.
</br>15 Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is the saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these I am foremost.
</br>16 Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long-suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.
<p></p>
</br>17 Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, [the] only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p></p>
</br>18 This mandate I commit to you, child, Timothy, in accord with the predictions that led directly on to you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare;
</br>19 holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside and have experienced shipwreck concerning [their] faith.
</br>20 Hy·me·nae´us and Alexander belong to these, and I have handed them over to Satan that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme.

</br>1 I therefore exhort, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, offerings of thanks, be made concerning all sorts of men,
</br>2 concerning kings and all those who are in high station; in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.
</br>3 This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,
</br>4 whose will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
</br>5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus,
</br>6 who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—[this is] what is to be witnessed to at its own particular times.
</br>7 For the purpose of this witness I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth.
<p></p>
</br>8 Therefore I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands, apart from wrath and debates.
</br>9 Likewise I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb,
</br>10 but in the way that befits women professing to reverence God, namely, through good works.
<p></p>
</br>11 Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness.
</br>12 I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.
</br>13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
</br>14 Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and came to be in transgression.
</br>15 However, she will be kept safe through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and sanctification along with soundness of mind.

</br>1 That statement is faithful.
<p></p>
If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.
</br>2 The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach,
</br>3 not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, but reasonable, not belligerent, not a lover of money,
</br>4 a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness;
</br>5 (if indeed any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God’s congregation?)
</br>6 not a newly converted man, for fear that he might get puffed up [with pride] and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil.
</br>7 Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony from people on the outside, in order that he might not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil.
<p></p>
</br>8 Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued, not giving themselves to a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain,
</br>9 holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.
<p></p>
</br>10 Also, let these be tested as to fitness first, then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.
<p></p>
</br>11 Women should likewise be serious, not slanderous, moderate in habits, faithful in all things.
<p></p>
</br>12 Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over children and their own households.
</br>13 For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>14 I am writing you these things, though I am hoping to come to you shortly,
</br>15 but in case I am delayed, that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of [the] living God, a pillar and support of the truth.
</br>16 Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in [the] world, was received up in glory.’

</br>1 However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons,
</br>2 by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron;
</br>3 forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.
</br>4 The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
</br>5 for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over [it].
<p></p>
</br>6 By giving these advices to the brothers you will be a fine minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching which you have followed closely.
</br>7 But turn down the false stories which violate what is holy and which old women tell. On the other hand, be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim.
</br>8 For bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.
</br>9 Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is that statement.
</br>10 For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.
<p></p>
</br>11 Keep on giving these commands and teaching them.
</br>12 Let no man ever look down on your youth. On the contrary, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.
</br>13 While I am coming, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
</br>14 Do not be neglecting the gift in you that was given you through a prediction and when the body of older men laid their hands upon you.
</br>15 Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all [persons].
</br>16 Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

</br>1 Do not severely criticize an older man. To the contrary, entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers,
</br>2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.
<p></p>
</br>3 Honor widows that are actually widows.
</br>4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household and to keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents, for this is acceptable in God’s sight.
</br>5 Now the woman who is actually a widow and left destitute has put her hope in God and persists in supplications and prayers night and day.
</br>6 But the one that goes in for sensual gratification is dead though she is living.
</br>7 So keep on giving these commands, that they may be irreprehensible.
</br>8 Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.
<p></p>
</br>9 Let a widow be put on the list who has become not less than sixty years old, a wife of one husband,
</br>10 having a witness borne to her for fine works, if she reared children, if she entertained strangers, if she washed the feet of holy ones, if she relieved those in tribulation, if she diligently followed every good work.
<p></p>
</br>11 On the other hand, turn down younger widows, for when their sexual impulses have come between them and the Christ, they want to marry,
</br>12 having a judgment because they have disregarded their first [expression of] faith.
</br>13 At the same time they also learn to be unoccupied, gadding about to the houses; yes, not only unoccupied, but also gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs, talking of things they ought not.
</br>14 Therefore I desire the younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give no inducement to the opposer to revile.
</br>15 Already, in fact, some have been turned aside to follow Satan.
</br>16 If any believing woman has widows, let her relieve them, and let the congregation not be under the burden. Then it can relieve those who are actually widows.
<p></p>
</br>17 Let the older men who preside in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.
</br>18 For the scripture says: “You must not muzzle a bull when it threshes out the grain”; also: “The workman is worthy of his wages.”
</br>19 Do not admit an accusation against an older man, except only on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
</br>20 Reprove before all onlookers persons who practice sin, that the rest also may have fear.
</br>21 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to keep these things without prejudgment, doing nothing according to a biased leaning.
<p></p>
</br>22 Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.
<p></p>
</br>23 Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.
<p></p>
</br>24 The sins of some men are publicly manifest, leading directly to judgment, but as for other men [their sins] also become manifest later.
</br>25 In the same way also the fine works are publicly manifest and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hid.

</br>1 Let as many as are slaves under a yoke keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor, that the name of God and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously.
</br>2 Moreover, let those having believing owners not look down on them, because they are brothers. On the contrary, let them the more readily be slaves, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved.
<p></p>
Keep on teaching these things and giving these exhortations.
</br>3 If any man teaches other doctrine and does not assent to healthful words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor to the teaching that accords with godly devotion,
</br>4 he is puffed up [with pride], not understanding anything, but being mentally diseased over questionings and debates about words. From these things spring envy, strife, abusive speeches, wicked suspicions,
</br>5 violent disputes about trifles on the part of men corrupted in mind and despoiled of the truth, thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain.
</br>6 To be sure, it is a means of great gain, [this] godly devotion along with self-sufficiency.
</br>7 For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out.
</br>8 So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.
<p></p>
</br>9 However, those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.
</br>10 For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.
<p></p>
</br>11 However, you, O man of God, flee from these things. But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper.
</br>12 Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.
<p></p>
</br>13 In the sight of God, who preserves all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who as a witness made the fine public declaration before Pontius Pilate, I give you orders
</br>14 that you observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</br>15 This [manifestation] the happy and only Potentate will show in its own appointed times, [he] the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,
</br>16 the one alone having immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom not one of men has seen or can see. To him be honor and might everlasting. Amen.
<p></p>
</br>17 Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high-minded, and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment;
</br>18 to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share,
</br>19 safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life.
<p></p>
</br>20 O Timothy, guard what is laid up in trust with you, turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called “knowledge.”
</br>21 For making a show of such [knowledge] some have deviated from the faith.
<p></p>
May the undeserved kindness be with YOU people.
