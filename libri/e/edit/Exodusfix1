</br>1 Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt with Jacob; each man and his household came:
</br>2 Reu´ben, Sim´e·on, Le´vi and Judah,
</br>3 Is´sa·char, Zeb´u·lun and Benjamin,
</br>4 Dan and Naph´ta·li, Gad and Ash´er.
</br>5 And all the souls who issued out of Jacob’s upper thigh came to be seventy souls, but Joseph was already in Egypt.
</br>6 Eventually Joseph died, and also all his brothers and all that generation.
</br>7 And the sons of Israel became fruitful and began to swarm; and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at a very extraordinary rate, so that the land got to be filled with them.
<p></p>
</br>8 In time there arose over Egypt a new king who did not know Joseph.
</br>9 And he proceeded to say to his people: “Look! The people of the sons of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we are.
</br>10 Come on! Let us deal shrewdly with them, for fear they may multiply, and it must turn out that, in case war should befall us, then they certainly will also be added to those who hate us and will fight against us and go up out of the country.”
<p></p>
</br>11 So they set over them chiefs of forced labor for the purpose of oppressing them in their burden-bearing; and they went building cities as storage places for Phar´aoh, namely, Pi´thom and Ra·am´ses.
</br>12 But the more they would oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading abroad, so that they felt a sickening dread as a result of the sons of Israel.
</br>13 Consequently the Egyptians made the sons of Israel slave under tyranny.
</br>14 And they kept making their life bitter with hard slavery at clay mortar and bricks and with every form of slavery in the field, yes, every form of slavery of theirs in which they used them as slaves under tyranny.
<p></p>
</br>15 Later on the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, the name of one of whom was Shiph´rah and the name of the other Pu´ah,
</br>16 yes, he went so far as to say: “When YOU help the Hebrew women to give birth and YOU do see them on the stool for childbirth, if it is a son, YOU must also put it to death; but if it is a daughter, it must also live.”
</br>17 However, the midwives feared the [true] God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them, but they would preserve the male children alive.
</br>18 In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them: “Why is it YOU have done this thing, in that YOU preserved the male children alive?”
</br>19 In turn the midwives said to Phar´aoh: “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. Because they are lively, they have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.”
<p></p>
</br>20 So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people kept growing more numerous and becoming very mighty.
</br>21 And it came about that because the midwives had feared the [true] God he later presented them with families.
</br>22 Finally Phar´aoh commanded all his people, saying: “Every newborn son YOU are to throw into the river Nile, but every daughter YOU are to preserve alive.”

</br>1 Meantime, a certain man of the house of Le´vi went ahead and took a daughter of Le´vi.
</br>2 And the woman became pregnant and brought a son to birth. When she saw how good-looking he was, she kept him concealed for three lunar months.
</br>3 When she was no longer able to conceal him, she then took for him an ark of papyrus and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the child in it and put it among the reeds by the bank of the river Nile.
</br>4 Further, his sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would be done with him.
<p></p>
</br>5 After a while Phar´aoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the Nile River, and her female attendants were walking by the side of the Nile River. And she caught sight of the ark in the middle of the reeds. Immediately she sent her slave girl that she might get it.
</br>6 When she opened it she got to see the child, and here the boy was weeping. At that she felt compassion for him, although she said: “This is one of the children of the Hebrews.”
</br>7 Then his sister said to Phar´aoh’s daughter: “Shall I go and specially call for you a nursing woman from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?”
</br>8 So Phar´aoh’s daughter said to her: “Go!” At once the maiden went and called the child’s mother.
</br>9 Phar´aoh’s daughter then said to her: “Take this child with you and nurse him for me, and I myself shall give you your wages.” Accordingly the woman took the child and nursed him.
</br>10 And the child grew up. Then she brought him to Phar´aoh’s daughter, so that he became a son to her; and she proceeded to call his name Moses and to say: “It is because I have drawn him out of the water.”
<p></p>
</br>11 Now it came about in those days, as Moses was becoming strong, that he went out to his brothers that he might look at the burdens they were bearing; and he caught sight of a certain Egyptian striking a certain Hebrew of his brothers.
</br>12 So he turned this way and that and saw there was nobody in sight. Then he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.
<p></p>
</br>13 However, he went out on the following day and here there were two Hebrew men struggling with each other. So he said to the one in the wrong: “Why should you strike your companion?”
</br>14 At this he said: “Who appointed you as a prince and judge over us? Are you intending to kill me just as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses now got afraid and said: “Surely the thing has become known!”
<p></p>
</br>15 Subsequently Phar´aoh got to hear of this thing, and he attempted to kill Moses; but Moses ran away from Phar´aoh that he might dwell in the land of Mid´i·an; and he took a seat by a well.
</br>16 Now the priest of Mid´i·an had seven daughters, and as usual they came and drew water and filled the gutters to water their father’s flock.
</br>17 And as usual the shepherds came and drove them away. At this Moses got up and helped the women out and watered their flock.
</br>18 So when they came home to Reu´el their father he exclaimed: “How is it YOU have come home so quickly today?”
</br>19 To this they said: “A certain Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and, besides, he actually drew water for us that he might water the flock.”
</br>20 Then he said to his daughters: “But where is he? Why is it that YOU have left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
</br>21 After that Moses showed willingness to dwell with the man, and he gave Zip·po´rah his daughter to Moses.
</br>22 Later she bore a son and he called his name Ger´shom, because, he said: “An alien resident I have come to be in a foreign land.”
<p></p>
</br>23 And it came about during those many days that the king of Egypt finally died, but the sons of Israel continued to sigh because of the slavery and to cry out in complaint, and their cry for help kept going up to the [true] God because of the slavery.
</br>24 In time God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
</br>25 So God looked on the sons of Israel and God took notice.

<p></p>
</br>1 And Moses became a shepherd of the flock of Jeth´ro, the priest of Mid´i·an, whose son-in-law he was. While he was driving the flock to the west side of the wilderness, he came at length to the mountain of the [true] God, to Ho´reb.
</br>2 Then Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, why, here the thornbush was burning with the fire and yet the thornbush was not consumed.
</br>3 At this Moses said: “Let me just turn aside that I may inspect this great phenomenon, as to why the thornbush is not burnt up.”
</br>4 When Jehovah saw that he turned aside to inspect, God at once called to him out of the midst of the thornbush and said: “Moses! Moses!” to which he said: “Here I am.”
</br>5 Then he said: “Do not come near here. Draw your sandals from off your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
<p></p>
</br>6 And he went on to say: “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses concealed his face, because he was afraid to look at the [true] God.
</br>7 And Jehovah added: “Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work; because I well know the pains they suffer.
</br>8 And I am proceeding to go down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the locality of the Ca´naan·ites and the Hit´tites and the Am´or·ites and the Per´iz·zites and the Hi´vites and the Jeb´u·sites.
</br>9 And now, look! the outcry of the sons of Israel has come to me, and I have seen also the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
</br>10 And now come and let me send you to Phar´aoh, and you bring my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.”
<p></p>
</br>11 However, Moses said to the [true] God: “Who am I that I should go to Phar´aoh and that I have to bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”
</br>12 To this he said: “Because I shall prove to be with you, and this is the sign for you that it is I who have sent you: After you have brought the people out of Egypt, YOU people will serve the [true] God on this mountain.”
<p></p>
</br>13 Nevertheless, Moses said to the [true] God: “Suppose I am now come to the sons of Israel and I do say to them, ‘The God of YOUR forefathers has sent me to YOU,’ and they do say to me, ‘What is his name?’ What shall I say to them?”
</br>14 At this God said to Moses: “I SHALL PROVE TO BE WHAT I SHALL PROVE TO BE.” And he added: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘I SHALL PROVE TO BE has sent me to YOU.’”
</br>15 Then God said once more to Moses:
<p></p>
“This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Jehovah the God of YOUR forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has sent me to YOU.’ This is my name to time indefinite, and this is the memorial of me to generation after generation.
</br>16 You go, and you must gather the older men of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘Jehovah the God of YOUR forefathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: “I will without fail give attention to YOU and to what is being done to YOU in Egypt.
</br>17 And so I say, I shall bring YOU up out of affliction by the Egyptians to the land of the Ca´naan·ites and the Hit´tites and the Am´or·ites and the Per´iz·zites and the Hi´vites and the Jeb´u·sites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’
<p></p>
</br>18 “And they will certainly listen to your voice, and you must come, you and the older men of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and YOU men must say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has come in touch with us, and now we want to go, please, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we want to sacrifice to Jehovah our God.’
</br>19 And I, even I, well know that the king of Egypt will not give YOU permission to go except by a strong hand.
</br>20 And I shall have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonderful acts that I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will send YOU out.
</br>21 And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it will certainly occur that when YOU go, YOU will not go empty-handed.
</br>22 And each woman must ask from her neighbor and from the woman residing as an alien in her house articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles, and YOU must put them upon YOUR sons and YOUR daughters; and YOU must strip the Egyptians.”

</br>1 However, Moses in answering said: “But suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice, because they are going to say, ‘Jehovah did not appear to you.’”
</br>2 Then Jehovah said to him: “What is that in your hand?” to which he said: “A rod.”
</br>3 Next he said: “Throw it on the earth.” So he threw it on the earth, and it became a serpent; and Moses began to flee from it.
</br>4 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Thrust your hand out and grab hold of it by the tail.” So he thrust his hand out and grabbed hold of it, and it became a rod in his palm.
</br>5 “In order that,” to quote him, “they may believe that Jehovah the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Then Jehovah said to him once more: “Stick your hand, please, into the upper fold of your garment.” So he stuck his hand into the upper fold of his garment. When he drew it out, why, here his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow!
</br>7 After that he said: “Return your hand into the upper fold of your garment.” So he returned his hand into the upper fold of his garment. When he drew it out of the upper fold of his garment, why, here it was restored like the rest of his flesh!
</br>8 “And it must occur that,” to quote him, “if they will not believe you and will not listen to the voice of the first sign, then they will certainly believe the voice of the later sign.
</br>9 Still, it must occur that, if they will not believe even these two signs and will not listen to your voice, then you will have to take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry land; and the water that you will take from the Nile River will certainly become, yes, it will indeed become blood on the dry land.”
<p></p>
</br>10 Moses now said to Jehovah: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but I am not a fluent speaker, neither since yesterday nor since before that nor since your speaking to your servant, for I am slow of mouth and slow of tongue.”
</br>11 At that Jehovah said to him: “Who appointed a mouth for man or who appoints the speechless or the deaf or the clear-sighted or the blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
</br>12 So now go, and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth and I will teach you what you ought to say.”
</br>13 But he said: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but send, please, by the hand of the one whom you are going to send.”
</br>14 Then Jehovah’s anger grew hot against Moses and he said: “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I do know that he can really speak. And, besides, here he is on his way out to meet you. When he does see you, he will certainly rejoice in his heart.
</br>15 And you must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach YOU men what YOU are to do.
</br>16 And he must speak for you to the people; and it must occur that he will serve as a mouth to you, and you will serve as God to him.
</br>17 And this rod you will take in your hand that you may perform the signs with it.”
<p></p>
</br>18 Accordingly Moses went and returned to Jeth´ro his father-in-law and said to him: “I want to go, please, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt that I may see whether they are still alive.” So Jeth´ro said to Moses: “Go in peace.”
</br>19 After that Jehovah said to Moses in Mid´i·an: “Go, return to Egypt, because all the men who were hunting for your soul are dead.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Then Moses took his wife and his sons and made them ride on an ass, and he proceeded to return to the land of Egypt. Moreover, Moses took the rod of the [true] God in his hand.
</br>21 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “After you have gone and returned to Egypt see that YOU men actually perform all the miracles that I have put in your hand before Phar´aoh. As for me, I shall let his heart become obstinate; and he will not send the people away.
</br>22 And you must say to Phar´aoh, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Israel is my son, my firstborn.
</br>23 And I say to you: Send my son away that he may serve me. But should you refuse to send him away, here I am killing your son, your firstborn.”’”
<p></p>
</br>24 Now it came about on the road at the lodging place that Jehovah got to meet him and kept looking for a way to put him to death.
</br>25 Finally Zip·po´rah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and caused it to touch his feet and said: “It is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”
</br>26 Consequently he let go of him. At that time she said: “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
<p></p>
</br>27 Then Jehovah said to Aaron: “Go to meet Moses into the wilderness.” With that he went and met him in the mountain of the [true] God and kissed him.
</br>28 And Moses proceeded to tell Aaron all the words of Jehovah, who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.
</br>29 After that Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the older men of the sons of Israel.
</br>30 Then Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs under the eyes of the people.
</br>31 At this the people believed. When they heard that Jehovah had turned his attention to the sons of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.

</br>1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and proceeded to say to Phar´aoh: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Send my people away that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’”
</br>2 But Phar´aoh said: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.”
</br>3 However, they went on to say: “The God of the Hebrews has come in touch with us. We want to go, please, a journey of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise he may strike at us with pestilence or with sword.”
</br>4 At this the king of Egypt said to them: “Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that YOU cause the people to leave off from their works? Go bearing YOUR burdens!”
</br>5 And Phar´aoh continued: “Look! The people of the land are now many, and YOU indeed make them desist from their bearing of burdens.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Immediately on that day Phar´aoh commanded those who drove the people to work and their officers, saying:
</br>7 “YOU must not gather straw to give to the people to make bricks as formerly. Let them themselves go and gather straw for themselves.
</br>8 Moreover, the required amount of bricks that they were making formerly, YOU will further impose upon them. YOU must not make any reduction for them, because they are relaxing. That is why they are crying out, saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our God!’
</br>9 Let the service be heavy upon the men and let them work at it, and let them not pay attention to false words.”
<p></p>
</br>10 So those who drove the people to work and their officers went out and said to the people: “Here is what Phar´aoh has said, ‘I am giving YOU no more straw.
</br>11 YOU yourselves go, get straw for yourselves wherever YOU may find it, because there is to be no reducing of YOUR services one bit.’”
</br>12 Consequently the people scattered about over all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
</br>13 And those who drove them to work kept urging them, saying: “Finish YOUR works, each one his work, day for day, just as when straw was available.”
</br>14 Later on the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Phar´aoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, these saying: “Why is it YOU did not finish YOUR prescribed task in making bricks as formerly, both yesterday and today?”
<p></p>
</br>15 Consequently the officers of the sons of Israel went in and began to cry out to Phar´aoh, saying: “Why do you deal this way with your servants?
</br>16 There is no straw given to your servants and yet they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and here your servants are beaten, whereas your own people are at fault.”
</br>17 But he said: “YOU are relaxing, YOU are relaxing! That is why YOU are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’
</br>18 And now go, serve! Though no straw will be given to YOU, yet YOU are to give the fixed amount of bricks.”
<p></p>
</br>19 Then the officers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in an evil plight at the saying: “YOU must not deduct from YOUR bricks one bit of anyone’s daily rate.”
</br>20 After that they encountered Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Phar´aoh.
</br>21 At once they said to them: “May Jehovah look upon YOU and judge, since YOU have made us smell offensive before Phar´aoh and before his servants so as to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”
</br>22 Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said: “Jehovah, why have you caused evil to this people? Why is it that you have sent me?
</br>23 For from the time that I went in before Phar´aoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have by no means delivered your people.”

</br>1 So Jehovah said to Moses: “Now you will see what I shall do to Phar´aoh, because on account of a strong hand he will send them away and on account of a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”
<p></p>
</br>2 And God went on to speak to Moses and to say to him: “I am Jehovah.
</br>3 And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty, but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.
</br>4 And I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Ca´naan, the land of their alien residences in which they resided as aliens.
</br>5 And I, even I, have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I remember my covenant.
<p></p>
</br>6 “Therefore say to the sons of Israel, ‘I am Jehovah, and I shall certainly bring YOU out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver YOU from their slavery, and I shall indeed reclaim YOU with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
</br>7 And I shall certainly take YOU to me as a people, and I shall indeed prove to be God to YOU; and YOU will certainly know that I am Jehovah YOUR God who is bringing YOU out from under the burdens of Egypt.
</br>8 And I shall certainly bring YOU into the land that I raised my hand in oath to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and I shall indeed give it to YOU as something to possess. I am Jehovah.’”
<p></p>
</br>9 Afterward Moses spoke to this effect to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses out of discouragement and for the hard slavery.
<p></p>
</br>10 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
</br>11 “Go in, speak to Phar´aoh, Egypt’s king, that he should send the sons of Israel away out of his land.”
</br>12 However, Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying: “Look! The sons of Israel have not listened to me; and how will Phar´aoh ever listen to me, as I am uncircumcised in lips?”
</br>13 But Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron and to issue the command by them to the sons of Israel and to Phar´aoh, Egypt’s king, in order to bring the sons of Israel out from the land of Egypt.

</br>2 You—you will speak all that I shall command you; and Aaron your brother will do the speaking to Phar´aoh, and he must send the sons of Israel away from his land.
</br>3 As for me, I shall let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, and I shall certainly multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt.
</br>4 And Phar´aoh will not listen to YOU men; and I shall have to lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my armies, my people, the sons of Israel, out from the land of Egypt with great judgments.
</br>5 And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt, and I shall indeed bring the sons of Israel out from their midst.”
</br>6 And Moses and Aaron went ahead doing as Jehovah had commanded them. They did just so.
</br>7 And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old at the time of their speaking to Phar´aoh.
<p></p>
</br>8 Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron:
</br>9 “In case that Phar´aoh speaks to YOU, saying, ‘Produce a miracle for yourselves,’ then you must say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before Phar´aoh.’ It will become a big snake.”
</br>10 So Moses and Aaron went on in to Phar´aoh and did exactly as Jehovah had commanded. Accordingly Aaron threw his rod down before Phar´aoh and his servants and it became a big snake.
</br>11 However, Phar´aoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and the magic-practicing priests of Egypt themselves also proceeded to do the same thing with their magic arts.
</br>12 So they threw down each one his rod, and they became big snakes; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
</br>13 Still, Phar´aoh’s heart became obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.
<p></p>
</br>14 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Phar´aoh’s heart is unresponsive. He has refused to send the people away.
</br>15 Go to Phar´aoh in the morning. Look! He is going out to the water! And you must put yourself in position to meet him by the edge of the Nile River, and the rod that turned into a serpent you are to take in your hand.
</br>16 And you must say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying: “Send my people away that they may serve me in the wilderness,” but here you have not obeyed until now.
</br>17 This is what Jehovah has said: “By this you will know that I am Jehovah. Here I am striking with the rod that is in my hand upon the water that is in the Nile River, and it will certainly turn into blood.
</br>18 And the fish that are in the Nile River will die, and the Nile River will actually stink, and the Egyptians will simply have no stomach for drinking water from the Nile River.”’”

</br>19 Subsequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their Nile canals and over their reedy pools and over all their impounded waters, that they may become blood.’ And there will certainly be blood in all the land of Egypt and in the wooden vessels and in the stone vessels.”
</br>20 Immediately Moses and Aaron did so, just as Jehovah had commanded, and he lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile River under the eyes of Phar´aoh and his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile River was turned into blood.
</br>21 And the fish that were in the Nile River died, and the Nile River began to stink; and the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the Nile River; and the blood came to be in all the land of Egypt.
<p></p>
</br>22 Nevertheless, the magic-practicing priests of Egypt proceeded to do the same thing with their secret arts; so that Phar´aoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.
</br>23 Hence Phar´aoh turned and went into his house, and he did not set his heart to have any regard for this either.
</br>24 And all the Egyptians went digging round about the Nile River for water to drink, because they were unable to drink any water of the Nile River.
</br>25 And seven days came to be fulfilled after Jehovah’s striking the Nile River.

<p></p>
</br>1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar´aoh, and you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.
</br>2 And if you keep refusing to send them away, here I am plaguing all your territory with frogs.
</br>3 And the Nile River will fairly teem with frogs, and they will certainly come up and enter into your house and your inner bedroom and upon your couch and into the houses of your servants and on your people and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs.
</br>4 And on you and on your people and on all your servants the frogs will come up.”’”
<p></p>
</br>5 Later on Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch your hand with your rod out over the rivers, the Nile canals and the reedy pools and make the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.’”
</br>6 At that Aaron stretched his hand out over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of Egypt.
</br>7 However, the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts and made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.
</br>8 In time Phar´aoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Entreat Jehovah that he may remove the frogs from me and my people, as I want to send the people away that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.”
</br>9 Then Moses said to Phar´aoh: “You take the glory over me to say when I shall make entreaty for you and your servants and your people in order to cut the frogs off from you and your houses. Only in the Nile River will they be left.”
</br>10 To this he said: “Tomorrow.” So he said: “It will be according to your word, in order that you may know that there is no one else like Jehovah our God,
</br>11 in that the frogs will certainly turn away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. Only in the Nile River will they be left.”
<p></p>
</br>12 Accordingly Moses and Aaron went out from Phar´aoh, and Moses cried out to Jehovah because of the frogs that He had put upon Phar´aoh.
</br>13 Then Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and the frogs began to die off from the houses, the courtyards and the fields.
</br>14 And they went piling them up, heaps upon heaps, and the land began to stink.
</br>15 When Phar´aoh got to see that relief had taken place, he made his heart unresponsive; and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.
<p></p>
</br>16 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch your rod out and strike the dust of the earth, and it must become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’”
</br>17 And they proceeded to do this. So Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and the gnats came to be on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
</br>18 And the magic-practicing priests tried to do the same by their secret arts, in order to bring forth gnats, but they were unable. And the gnats came to be on man and beast.
</br>19 Hence the magic-practicing priests said to Phar´aoh: “It is the finger of God!” But Phar´aoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.
<p></p>
</br>20 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and take a position in front of Phar´aoh. Look! He is coming out to the water! And you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.
</br>21 But if you are not sending my people away, here I am sending upon you and your servants and your people and into your houses the gadfly; and the houses of Egypt will simply be full of the gadfly, and also the ground upon which they are.
</br>22 And on that day I shall certainly make the land of Go´shen upon which my people are standing distinct, that no gadfly may exist there; in order that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
</br>23 And I shall indeed set a demarcation between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will take place.”’”
<p></p>
</br>24 And Jehovah proceeded to do so; and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of Phar´aoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land came to ruin as a result of the gadflies.
</br>25 Finally Phar´aoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Go, sacrifice to YOUR God in the land.”
</br>26 But Moses said: “It is not admissible to do so, because we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God a thing detestable to the Egyptians. Suppose we would sacrifice a thing detestable to the Egyptians before their eyes; would they not stone us?
</br>27 We shall go a journey of three days into the wilderness and we shall definitely sacrifice to Jehovah our God just as he has said to us.”
<p></p>
</br>28 Phar´aoh now said: “I—I shall send YOU away, and YOU will indeed sacrifice to Jehovah YOUR God in the wilderness. Only do not make it quite so far away that YOU are going. Make entreaty in my behalf.”
</br>29 Then Moses said: “Here I am going forth from you, and I shall indeed make entreaty to Jehovah, and the gadflies will certainly turn away from Phar´aoh, his servants and his people tomorrow. Only let not Phar´aoh trifle again in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.”
</br>30 After that Moses went out from Phar´aoh and made entreaty to Jehovah.
</br>31 So Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and the gadflies turned away from Phar´aoh, his servants and his people. Not one was left.
</br>32 However, Phar´aoh made his heart unresponsive this time also and did not send the people away.

<p></p>
</br>1 Consequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar´aoh and you must state to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.
</br>2 But if you continue refusing to send them away and you are still keeping hold of them,
</br>3 look! Jehovah’s hand is coming upon your livestock that is in the field. On the horses, the asses, the camels, the herd and the flock there will be a very heavy pestilence.
</br>4 And Jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing of all that belongs to the sons of Israel will die.”’”
</br>5 Moreover, Jehovah set an appointed time, saying: “Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Accordingly Jehovah did this thing on the next day, and all sorts of livestock of Egypt began to die; but not one of the livestock of the sons of Israel died.
</br>7 Then Phar´aoh sent, and, look! not so much as one of Israel’s livestock had died. Nevertheless, Phar´aoh’s heart continued to be unresponsive, and he did not send the people away.
<p></p>
</br>8 After that Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: “Take for yourselves both hands full of soot from a kiln, and Moses must toss it toward the heavens in Phar´aoh’s sight.
</br>9 And it must become a powder upon all the land of Egypt, and it must become boils breaking out with blisters upon man and beast in all the land of Egypt.”
<p></p>
</br>10 So they took the soot of a kiln and stood before Phar´aoh, and Moses tossed it toward the heavens, and it became boils with blisters, breaking out on man and beast.
</br>11 And the magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before Moses as a result of the boils, because the boils had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the Egyptians.
</br>12 But Jehovah let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had stated to Moses.
<p></p>
</br>13 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and take a position in front of Phar´aoh, and you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.
</br>14 For at this time I am sending all my blows against your heart and upon your servants and your people, to the end that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
</br>15 For by now I could have thrust my hand out that I might strike you and your people with pestilence and that you might be effaced from the earth.
</br>16 But, in fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.
</br>17 Are you still behaving haughtily against my people in not sending them away?
</br>18 Here I am causing it to rain down tomorrow about this time a very heavy hail, the like of which has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
</br>19 And now send, bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter. As for any man and beast that will be found in the field and not gathered into the house, the hail will have to come down upon them, and they will have to die.”’”
<p></p>
</br>20 Anyone who feared Jehovah’s word among Phar´aoh’s servants caused his own servants and his livestock to flee into the houses,
</br>21 but whoever did not set his heart to have any regard for Jehovah’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field.
<p></p>
</br>22 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that hail may come on all the land of Egypt, upon man and beast and all vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.”
</br>23 So Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens; and Jehovah gave thunders and hail, and fire would run down to the earth, and Jehovah kept making it rain down hail upon the land of Egypt.
</br>24 Thus there came hail, and fire quivering in among the hail. It was very heavy, so that there had not occurred any like it in all the land of Egypt from the time it became a nation.
</br>25 And the hail went striking at all the land of Egypt. The hail struck everything that was in the field, from man to beast, and all sorts of vegetation of the field; and it shattered all sorts of trees of the field.
</br>26 Only in the land of Go´shen, where the sons of Israel were, there occurred no hail.
<p></p>
</br>27 Eventually Phar´aoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them: “I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are in the wrong.
</br>28 Entreat Jehovah that this may be enough of the occurring of God’s thunders and hail. Then I am willing to send YOU away, and YOU will not stay any longer.”
</br>29 So Moses said to him: “As soon as I go out of the city I shall spread my hands up to Jehovah. The thunders will stop and the hail will not continue any longer, in order that you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah.
</br>30 As for you and your servants, I know already that YOU will not even then show fear because of Jehovah God.”
<p></p>
</br>31 As it was, the flax and the barley had been struck, because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds.
</br>32 But the wheat and the spelt had not been struck, because they were seasonally late.
</br>33 Moses now went out of the city from Phar´aoh and spread his hands up to Jehovah, and the thunders and the hail began to stop and rain did not pour down on the earth.
</br>34 When Phar´aoh got to see that the rain and the hail and the thunders had stopped, he went sinning again and making his heart unresponsive, he as well as his servants.
</br>35 And Phar´aoh’s heart continued obstinate, and he did not send the sons of Israel away, just as Jehovah had stated by means of Moses.

<p></p>
</br>1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar´aoh, because I—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him,
</br>2 and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and YOU will certainly know that I am Jehovah.”
<p></p>
</br>3 So Moses and Aaron went in to Phar´aoh and said to him: “This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said, ‘How long must you refuse to submit yourself to me? Send my people away that they may serve me.
</br>4 For if you continue refusing to send my people away, here I am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow.
</br>5 And they will actually cover the visible surface of the earth and it will not be possible to see the earth; and they will simply eat up the rest of what has escaped, what has been left to YOU people by the hail, and they will certainly eat every sprouting tree of YOURS out of the field.
</br>6 And your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all Egypt will be filled to an extent that your fathers and your fathers’ fathers have not seen it from the day of their existing upon the ground until this day.’” With that he turned and went out from Phar´aoh.
<p></p>
</br>7 After that Phar´aoh’s servants said to him: “How long will this man prove to be as a snare to us? Send the men away that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt has perished?”
</br>8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Phar´aoh, and he said to them: “Go, serve Jehovah YOUR God. Who in particular are the ones going?”
</br>9 Then Moses said: “With our young people and our old people we shall go. With our sons and our daughters, with our sheep and our cattle we shall go, for we have a festival to Jehovah.”
</br>10 In turn he said to them: “Let it prove to be so, that Jehovah is with YOU when I shall send YOU and YOUR little ones away! See, on the contrary, something evil is YOUR aim.
</br>11 Not so! Go, please, YOU who are able-bodied men, and serve Jehovah, because that is what YOU are seeking to secure.” With that they were driven out from before Phar´aoh.
<p></p>
</br>12 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land, everything that the hail has let remain.”
</br>13 At once Moses stretched his rod out over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow upon the land all that day and all night. The morning came and the east wind carried the locusts.
</br>14 And the locusts began to come up over all the land of Egypt and to settle down upon all the territory of Egypt. They were very burdensome. Before them there had never turned up in this way locusts like them, and there will never turn up any in this way after them.
</br>15 And they went covering the visible surface of the entire land, and the land grew dark; and they went on eating up all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there was left nothing green on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt.
<p></p>
</br>16 So Phar´aoh hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and said: “I have sinned against Jehovah YOUR God and against YOU.
</br>17 And now pardon, please, my sin just this once and ENTREAT Jehovah YOUR God that he may turn away just this deadly plague from upon me.”
</br>18 So he went out from Phar´aoh and made entreaty to Jehovah.
</br>19 Then Jehovah made a shift to a very stiff west wind, and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was let remain in all the territory of Egypt.
</br>20 However, Jehovah let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not send the sons of Israel away.
<p></p>
</br>21 Jehovah then said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out toward the heavens, that darkness may occur over the land of Egypt and the darkness may be felt.”
</br>22 Moses immediately stretched his hand out toward the heavens, and a gloomy darkness began to occur in all the land of Egypt for three days.
</br>23 They did not see one another, and none of them got up from his own place three days; but for all the sons of Israel there proved to be light in their dwellings.
</br>24 After that Phar´aoh called Moses and said: “Go, SERVE Jehovah. Only YOUR sheep and YOUR cattle will be detained. YOUR little ones also may go with YOU.”
</br>25 But Moses said: “You yourself will also give into our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings, as we must render them to Jehovah our God.
</br>26 And our livestock will also go with us. Not a hoof will be allowed to remain, because it is from them that we shall take some to worship Jehovah our God, and we ourselves do not know what we shall render in worship to Jehovah until our arriving there.”
</br>27 At this Jehovah let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not consent to send them away.
</br>28 So Phar´aoh said to him: “Get out from me! Watch yourself! Do not try to see my face again, because on the day of your seeing my face you will die.”
</br>29 To this Moses said: “That is the way you have spoken. I shall not try to see your face anymore.”

</br>2 Speak, now, in the ears of the people, that they should ask every man of his companion and every woman of her companion articles of silver and articles of gold.”
</br>3 Accordingly Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. The man Moses too was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Phar´aoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.
<p></p>
</br>4 And Moses went on to say: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,
</br>5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt must die, from the firstborn of Phar´aoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant who is at the hand mill and every firstborn of beast.
</br>6 And there will certainly occur a great outcry in all the land of Egypt, the like of which has never yet occurred, and the like of which will never be brought about again.
</br>7 But against any of the sons of Israel will no dog move eagerly its tongue, from man to beast; in order that YOU people may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the sons of Israel.’
</br>8 And all these servants of yours will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow your steps.’ And after that I shall go out.” With that he went out from Phar´aoh in the heat of anger.
<p></p>
</br>9 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Phar´aoh will not listen to YOU men, in order for my miracles to be increased in the land of Egypt.”
</br>10 And Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Phar´aoh; but Jehovah would let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, so that he did not send the sons of Israel away from his land.

</br>1 Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:
</br>2 “This month will be the start of the months for YOU. It will be the first of the months of the year for YOU.
</br>3 Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month they are to take for themselves each one a sheep for the ancestral house, a sheep to a house.
</br>4 But if the household proves to be too small for the sheep, then he and his neighbor close by must take it into his house according to the number of souls; YOU should compute each one proportionate to his eating as regards the sheep.
</br>5 The sheep should prove to be sound, a male, a year old, for YOU. YOU may pick from the young rams or from the goats.
</br>6 And it must continue under safeguard by YOU until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it between the two evenings.
</br>7 And they must take some of the blood and splash it upon the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway belonging to the houses in which they will eat it.
<p></p>
</br>8 “‘And they must eat the flesh on this night. They should eat it roasted with fire and with unfermented cakes along with bitter greens.
</br>9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, cooked in water, but roast with fire, its head together with its shanks and its interior parts.
</br>10 And YOU must not leave any of it over till morning, but what is left over of it till morning YOU should burn with fire.
</br>11 And in this way YOU should eat it, with YOUR hips girded, sandals on YOUR feet and YOUR staff in YOUR hand; and YOU must eat it in haste. It is Jehovah’s passover.
</br>12 And I must pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I shall execute judgments. I am Jehovah.
</br>13 And the blood must serve as YOUR sign upon the houses where YOU are; and I must see the blood and pass over YOU, and the plague will not come on YOU as a ruination when I strike at the land of Egypt.
<p></p>
</br>14 “‘And this day must serve as a memorial for YOU, and YOU must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout YOUR generations. As a statute to time indefinite YOU should celebrate it.
</br>15 Seven days YOU are to eat unfermented cakes. Yes, on the first day YOU are to take away sourdough from YOUR houses, because anyone eating what is leavened, from the first day down to the seventh, that soul must be cut off from Israel.
</br>16 And on the first day there is to take place for YOU a holy convention, and on the seventh day a holy convention. No work is to be done on them. Only what every soul needs to eat, that alone may be done for YOU.
<p></p>
</br>17 “‘And YOU must keep the festival of unfermented cakes, because on this very day I must bring YOUR armies out from the land of Egypt. And YOU must keep this day throughout YOUR generations as a statute to time indefinite.
</br>18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening YOU are to eat unfermented cakes down till the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.
</br>19 Seven days no sourdough is to be found in YOUR houses, because anyone tasting what is leavened, whether he is an alien resident or a native of the land, that soul must be cut off from the assembly of Israel.
</br>20 Nothing leavened are YOU to eat. In all YOUR dwellings YOU are to eat unfermented cakes.’”
<p></p>
</br>21 Promptly Moses called all the older men of Israel and said to them: “Draw out and take for yourselves small cattle according to YOUR families, and slaughter the passover victim.
</br>22 And YOU must take a bunch of hyssop and dip it into the blood in a basin and strike upon the upper part of the doorway and upon the two doorposts some of the blood that is in the basin; and none of YOU should go out of the entrance of his house until morning.
</br>23 Then when Jehovah does pass through to plague the Egyptians and does see the blood upon the upper part of the doorway and upon the two doorposts, Jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance, and he will not allow the ruination to enter into YOUR houses to plague YOU.
<p></p>
</br>24 “And YOU must keep this thing as a regulation for you and your sons to time indefinite.
</br>25 And it must occur that when YOU come into the land that Jehovah will give YOU, just as he has stated, then YOU must keep this service.
</br>26 And it must occur that when YOUR sons say to YOU, ‘What does this service mean to YOU?’
</br>27 then YOU must say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when he plagued the Egyptians, but he delivered our houses.’”
<p></p>
Then the people bowed low and prostrated themselves.
</br>28 Subsequently the sons of Israel went and did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.
<p></p>
</br>29 And it came about that at midnight Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Phar´aoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison hole, and every firstborn of beast.
</br>30 Then Phar´aoh got up at night, he and all his servants and all [other] Egyptians; and there began arising a great outcry among the Egyptians, because there was not a house where there was not one dead.
</br>31 At once he called Moses and Aaron by night and said: “Get up, get out from the midst of my people, both YOU and the [other] sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah, just as YOU have stated.
</br>32 Take both YOUR flocks and YOUR herds, just as YOU have stated, and go. Also, YOU must bless me besides.”
<p></p>
</br>33 And the Egyptians began to urge the people in order to send them away quickly out of the land, “because,” they said, “we are all as good as dead!”
</br>34 Consequently the people carried their flour dough before it was leavened, with their kneading troughs wrapped up in their mantles upon their shoulder.
</br>35 And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses in that they went asking from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles.
</br>36 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that these granted them what was asked; and they stripped the Egyptians.
<p></p>
</br>37 And the sons of Israel proceeded to depart from Ram´e·ses for Suc´coth, to the number of six hundred thousand able-bodied men on foot, besides little ones.
</br>38 And a vast mixed company also went up with them, as well as flocks and herds, a very numerous stock of animals.
</br>39 And they began to bake the flour dough that they had brought out from Egypt into round cakes, unfermented cakes, because it had not leavened, for they had been driven out of Egypt and had not been able to linger and too they had not prepared any provisions for themselves.
<p></p>
</br>40 And the dwelling of the sons of Israel, who had dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
</br>41 And it came about at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, it even came about on this very day that all the armies of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt.
</br>42 It is a night for observance with regard to Jehovah for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. With regard to Jehovah this night is one for observance on the part of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
<p></p>
</br>43 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses and Aaron: “This is the statute of the passover: No foreigner may eat of it.
</br>44 But where there is any slave man purchased with money, you must circumcise him. Then first he may share in eating it.
</br>45 A settler and a hired laborer may not eat of it.
</br>46 In one house it is to be eaten. You must not take any of the flesh out of the house to some place outside. And YOU must not break a bone in it.
</br>47 All the assembly of Israel are to celebrate it.
</br>48 And in case an alien resident resides as an alien with you and he will actually celebrate the passover to Jehovah, let there be a circumcising of every male of his. First then he may come near to celebrate it; and he must become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.
</br>49 One law is to exist for the native and for the alien resident who is residing as an alien in YOUR midst.”
<p></p>
</br>50 So all the sons of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.

</br>12 then you must devote everyone that opens the womb to Jehovah, and every firstling, the young of a beast, which will come to be yours. The males belong to Jehovah.
</br>13 And every firstling ass you are to redeem with a sheep, and if you will not redeem it, then you must break its neck. And every firstborn of man among your sons you are to redeem.
<p></p>
</br>14 “And it must occur that in case your son should inquire of you later on, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ then you must say to him, ‘By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slaves.
</br>15 And it came about that Phar´aoh showed obstinacy toward sending us away, and Jehovah proceeded to kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast. That is why I am sacrificing to Jehovah all the males that open the womb, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’
</br>16 And it must serve as a sign upon your hand and as a frontlet band between your eyes, because by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.”
<p></p>
</br>17 And it came about at the time of Phar´aoh’s sending the people away that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Phi·lis´tines just because it was near, for God said: “It might be the people will feel regret when they see war and will certainly return to Egypt.”
</br>18 Hence God made the people go round about by the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. But it was in battle formation that the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt.
</br>19 And Moses was taking Joseph’s bones with him, because he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying: “God will without fail turn his attention to YOU, and YOU must take my bones up out of here with YOU.”
</br>20 And they proceeded to depart from Suc´coth and to encamp at E´tham at the edge of the wilderness.
<p></p>
</br>21 And Jehovah was going ahead of them in the daytime in a pillar of cloud to lead them by the way, and in the nighttime in a pillar of fire to give them light to go in the daytime and nighttime.
</br>22 The pillar of cloud would not move away from before the people in the daytime nor the pillar of fire in the nighttime.

<p></p>
</br>1 Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:
</br>2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, that they should turn back and encamp before Pi·ha·hi´roth between Mig´dol and the sea in view of Ba´al-ze´phon. In front of it YOU are to encamp by the sea.
</br>3 Then Phar´aoh will certainly say respecting the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering in confusion in the land. The wilderness has closed in upon them.’
</br>4 So I shall indeed let Phar´aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he will certainly chase after them and I shall get glory for myself by means of Phar´aoh and all his military forces; and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” Accordingly they did just that.
<p></p>
</br>5 Later it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away. Immediately the heart of Phar´aoh as well as his servants was changed regarding the people, so that they said: “What is this that we have done, in that we have sent Israel away from slaving for us?”
</br>6 So he proceeded to make his war chariots ready, and he took his people with him.
</br>7 And he proceeded to take six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt and warriors upon every one of them.
</br>8 Thus Jehovah let the heart of Phar´aoh the king of Egypt become obstinate, and he went chasing after the sons of Israel, while the sons of Israel were going out with uplifted hand.
</br>9 And the Egyptians went chasing after them, and all the chariot horses of Phar´aoh and his cavalrymen and his military forces were overtaking them while camping by the sea, by Pi·ha·hi´roth in view of Ba´al-ze´phon.
<p></p>
</br>10 When Phar´aoh got close by, the sons of Israel began to raise their eyes and here the Egyptians were marching after them; and the sons of Israel got quite afraid and began to cry out to Jehovah.
</br>11 And they proceeded to say to Moses: “Is it because there are no burial places at all in Egypt that you have taken us here to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt?
</br>12 Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than for us to die in the wilderness.”
</br>13 Then Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will perform for YOU today. For the Egyptians whom YOU do see today YOU will not see again, no, never again.
</br>14 Jehovah will himself fight for YOU, and YOU yourselves will be silent.”
<p></p>
</br>15 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Why do you keep crying out to me? Speak to the sons of Israel that they should break camp.
</br>16 As for you, lift up your rod and stretch your hand out over the sea and split it apart, that the sons of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
</br>17 As for me, here I am letting the hearts of the Egyptians become obstinate, that they may go in after them and that I may get glory for myself by means of Phar´aoh and all his military forces, his war chariots and his cavalrymen.
</br>18 And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I get glory for myself by means of Phar´aoh, his war chariots and his cavalrymen.”
<p></p>
</br>19 Then the angel of the [true] God who was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their rear, and the pillar of cloud departed from their van and stood in the rear of them.
</br>20 So it came in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. On the one hand it proved to be a cloud together with darkness. On the other hand it kept lighting up the night. And this group did not come near that group all night long.
<p></p>
</br>21 Moses now stretched his hand out over the sea; and Jehovah began making the sea go back by a strong east wind all night long and converting the sea basin into dry ground, and the waters were being split apart.
</br>22 At length the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry land, while the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
</br>23 And the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all the horses of Phar´aoh, his war chariots and his cavalrymen began going in after them, into the midst of the sea.
</br>24 And it came about during the morning watch that Jehovah began to look out upon the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of fire and cloud, and he went throwing the camp of the Egyptians into confusion.
</br>25 And he kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty; and the Egyptians began to say: “Let us flee from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah certainly fights for them against the Egyptians.”
<p></p>
</br>26 Finally Jehovah said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out over the sea, that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, their war chariots and their cavalrymen.”
</br>27 Moses at once stretched his hand out over the sea, and the sea began to come back to its normal condition at the approaching of morning. All the while the Egyptians were fleeing from encountering it, but Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea.
</br>28 And the waters kept coming back. Finally they covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen belonging to all of Phar´aoh’s military forces and who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as one among them was let remain.
<p></p>
</br>29 As for the sons of Israel, they walked on dry land in the midst of the seabed, and the waters were for them a wall on their right hand and on their left.
</br>30 Thus on that day Jehovah saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel got to see the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
</br>31 Israel also got to see the great hand that Jehovah put in action against the Egyptians; and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in Moses his servant.

</br>22 Later Moses caused Israel to depart from the Red Sea and they went out to the wilderness of Shur and marched on for three days in the wilderness, but they did not find water.
</br>23 In time they came to Ma´rah, but they were not able to drink the water from Ma´rah because it was bitter. That is why he called its name Ma´rah.
</br>24 And the people began to murmur against Moses, saying: “What are we to drink?”
</br>25 Then he cried out to Jehovah. So Jehovah directed him to a tree, and he threw it into the water and the water became sweet.
<p></p>
There He established for them a regulation and a case for judgment and there he put them to the test.
</br>26 And he went on to say: “If you will strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in his eyes and will indeed give ear to his commandments and keep all his regulations, I shall put none of the maladies upon you that I put upon the Egyptians; because I am Jehovah who is healing you.”
<p></p>
</br>27 After that they came to E´lim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. So they went camping there by the water.

<p></p>
</br>1 Later they departed from E´lim, and the entire assembly of the sons of Israel finally came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between E´lim and Si´nai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their coming out of the land of Egypt.
<p></p>
</br>2 And the entire assembly of the sons of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
</br>3 And the sons of Israel kept saying to them: “If only we had died by Jehovah’s hand in the land of Egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat, while we were eating bread to satisfaction, because YOU have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine.”
<p></p>
</br>4 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Here I am raining down bread for YOU from the heavens; and the people must go out and pick up each his amount day for day, in order that I may put them to the test as to whether they will walk in my law or not.
</br>5 And it must occur on the sixth day that they must prepare what they will bring in, and it must prove double what they keep picking up day by day.”
<p></p>
</br>6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel: “At evening YOU will certainly know that it is Jehovah who has brought YOU out from the land of Egypt.
</br>7 And in the morning YOU will indeed see Jehovah’s glory, because he has heard YOUR murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we that YOU should murmur against us?”
</br>8 And Moses continued: “It will be when Jehovah gives YOU in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to satisfaction, because Jehovah has heard YOUR murmurings that YOU are murmuring against him. And what are we? YOUR murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.”
<p></p>
</br>9 And Moses went on to say to Aaron: “Say to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, ‘Come near before Jehovah, because he has heard YOUR murmurings.’”
</br>10 Then it occurred that as soon as Aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, they turned and faced toward the wilderness, and, look! Jehovah’s glory appeared in the cloud.
<p></p>
</br>11 And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:
</br>12 “I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘Between the two evenings YOU will eat meat and in the morning YOU will be satisfied with bread; and YOU will certainly know that I am Jehovah YOUR God.’”
<p></p>
</br>13 Accordingly it occurred that in the evening the quails began to come up and cover the camp, and in the morning there had developed a layer of dew round about the camp.
</br>14 In time the layer of dew evaporated and here upon the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flaky thing, fine like hoarfrost upon the earth.
</br>15 When the sons of Israel got to see it, they began to say to one another: “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Hence Moses said to them: “It is the bread that Jehovah has given YOU for food.
</br>16 This is the word that Jehovah has commanded, ‘Pick up some of it, each one in proportion to his eating. YOU are to take an omer measure for each individual according to the number of the souls that each of YOU has in his tent.’”
</br>17 And the sons of Israel began to do so; and they went picking it up, some gathering much and some gathering little.
</br>18 When they would measure it by the omer, he that had gathered much had no surplus and he that had gathered little had no shortage. They picked it up each one in proportion to his eating.
<p></p>
</br>19 Then Moses said to them: “Let nobody leave any of it until the morning.”
</br>20 But they did not listen to Moses. When some men would leave some of it until the morning, it would breed worms and stink; so that Moses became indignant at them.
</br>21 And they would pick it up morning by morning, each one in proportion to his eating. When the sun got hot, it melted.
<p></p>
</br>22 And it came about on the sixth day that they picked up twice as much bread, two omer measures for one person. So all the chieftains of the assembly came and reported it to Moses.
</br>23 At that he said to them: “It is what Jehovah has spoken. Tomorrow there will be a sabbath observance of a holy sabbath to Jehovah. What YOU can bake, bake, and what YOU can boil, boil, and all the surplus that there is save it up for YOU as something to be kept until the morning.”
</br>24 Accordingly they saved it up until the morning, just as Moses had commanded; and it did not stink nor did maggots develop in it.
</br>25 Then Moses said: “Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today YOU will not find it in the field.
</br>26 Six days YOU will pick it up, but on the seventh day is a sabbath. On it none will form.”
</br>27 However, it came about on the seventh day that some of the people did go out to pick [it] up, but they found none.
<p></p>
</br>28 Consequently Jehovah said to Moses: “How long must YOU people refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
</br>29 Mark the fact that Jehovah has given YOU the sabbath. That is why he is giving YOU on the sixth day the bread of two days. Keep sitting each one in his own place. Let nobody go out from his locality on the seventh day.”
</br>30 And the people proceeded to observe the sabbath on the seventh day.
<p></p>
</br>31 And the house of Israel began to call its name “manna.” And it was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey.
</br>32 Then Moses said: “This is the word that Jehovah has commanded, ‘Fill an omer measure of it as something to be kept throughout YOUR generations, in order that they may see the bread that I made YOU eat in the wilderness when I was bringing YOU out of the land of Egypt.’”
</br>33 So Moses said to Aaron: “Take a jar and put in it an omerful of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout YOUR generations.”
</br>34 Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, Aaron proceeded to deposit it before the Testimony as something to be kept.
</br>35 And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until their coming to a land inhabited. The manna was what they ate until their coming to the frontier of the land of Ca´naan.
</br>36 Now an omer is a tenth of an e´phah measure.

</br>1 And the entire assembly of the sons of Israel proceeded to depart from the wilderness of Sin by stages, which they took according to the order of Jehovah, and went camping at Reph´i·dim. But there was no water for the people to drink.
<p></p>
</br>2 And the people fell to quarreling with Moses and saying: “Give us water that we may drink.” But Moses said to them: “Why are YOU quarreling with me? Why do YOU keep putting Jehovah to the test?”
</br>3 And the people went on thirsting there for water, and the people kept murmuring against Moses and saying: “Why is it that you have brought us up out of Egypt to put us and our sons and our livestock to death by thirst?”
</br>4 Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying: “What shall I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!”
<p></p>
</br>5 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Pass in front of the people and take with you some of the older men of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River. Take it in your hand and you must walk on.
</br>6 Look! I am standing before you there on the rock in Ho´reb. And you must strike on the rock, and water must come out of it, and the people must drink it.” Subsequently Moses did so under the eyes of the older men of Israel.
</br>7 So he called the name of the place Mas´sah and Mer´i·bah, because of the quarreling of the sons of Israel and because of their putting Jehovah to the test, saying: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?”
<p></p>
</br>8 And the A·mal´ek·ites proceeded to come and fight against Israel in Reph´i·dim.
</br>9 At this Moses said to Joshua: “Choose men for us and go out, fight against the A·mal´ek·ites. Tomorrow I am stationing myself upon the top of the hill, with the rod of the [true] God in my hand.”
</br>10 Then Joshua did just as Moses had said to him, in order to fight against the A·mal´ek·ites; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
<p></p>
</br>11 And it occurred that as soon as Moses would lift his hand up, the Israelites proved superior; but as soon as he would let down his hand, the A·mal´ek·ites proved superior.
</br>12 When the hands of Moses were heavy, then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side and the other on that side, so that his hands held steady until the sun set.
</br>13 Hence Joshua vanquished Am´a·lek and his people with the edge of the sword.
<p></p>
</br>14 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Write this as a memorial in the book and propound it in Joshua’s ears, ‘I shall completely wipe out the remembrance of Am´a·lek from under the heavens.’”
</br>15 And Moses proceeded to build an altar and to call its name Je·ho´vah-nis´si,

</br>2 So Jeth´ro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zip·po´rah, Moses’ wife, after the sending of her away,
</br>3 and her two sons, the name of one of whom was Ger´shom, “because,” he said, “an alien resident I have come to be in a foreign land”;
</br>4 and the name of the other was E·li·e´zer, “because,” to quote him, “the God of my father is my helper in that he delivered me from Phar´aoh’s sword.”
<p></p>
</br>5 So Jeth´ro, Moses’ father-in-law, and his sons and his wife came to Moses into the wilderness where he was camping, at the mountain of the [true] God.
</br>6 Then he sent word to Moses: “I, your father-in-law, Jeth´ro, am come to you, and also your wife and her two sons with her.”
</br>7 At once Moses went on out to meet his father-in-law, and he proceeded to prostrate himself and to kiss him; and they each one began asking how the other was getting along. After that they went into the tent.
<p></p>
</br>8 And Moses went to relating to his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Phar´aoh and Egypt on account of Israel, and all the hardship that had befallen them in the way, and yet Jehovah was delivering them.
</br>9 Then Jeth´ro felt glad over all the good that Jehovah had done for Israel in that he had delivered them from the hand of Egypt.
</br>10 Consequently Jeth´ro said: “Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered YOU from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Phar´aoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt.
</br>11 Now I do know that Jehovah is greater than all the [other] gods by reason of this affair in which they acted presumptuously against them.”
</br>12 Then Jeth´ro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron and all the older men of Israel came to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law, before the [true] God.
<p></p>
</br>13 And it came about on the next day that Moses sat down as usual to serve as judge for the people, and the people kept standing before Moses from the morning till the evening.
</br>14 And Moses’ father-in-law got to see all that he was doing for the people. So he said: “What kind of business is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone continue sitting and all the people continue taking their stand before you from morning till evening?”
</br>15 Then Moses said to his father-in-law: “Because the people keep coming to me to inquire of God.
</br>16 In the event that they have a case arise, it must come to me and I must judge between the one party and the other, and I must make known the decisions of the [true] God and his laws.”
<p></p>
</br>17 At this Moses’ father-in-law said to him: “It is not good the way you are doing.
</br>18 You will surely wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because this business is too big a load for you. You are unable to do it by yourself.
</br>19 Now listen to my voice. I shall advise you, and God will prove to be with you. You yourself serve as representative for the people before the [true] God, and you yourself must bring the cases to the [true] God.
</br>20 And you must warn them of what the regulations and the laws are, and you must make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do.
</br>21 But you yourself should select out of all the people capable men, fearing God, trustworthy men, hating unjust profit; and you must set these over them as chiefs over thousands, chiefs over hundreds, chiefs over fifties and chiefs over tens.
</br>22 And they must judge the people on every proper occasion; and it must occur that every big case they will bring to you, but every small case they themselves will handle as judges. So make it lighter for yourself, and they must carry the load with you.
</br>23 If you do this very thing, and God has commanded you, you will then certainly be able to stand it and, besides, this people will all come to their own place in peace.”
<p></p>
</br>24 Immediately Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
</br>25 And Moses proceeded to choose capable men out of all Israel and to give them positions as heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens.
</br>26 And they judged the people on every proper occasion. A hard case they would bring to Moses, but every small case they themselves would handle as judges.

</br>1 In the third month after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came into the wilderness of Si´nai.
</br>2 And they proceeded to pull away from Reph´i·dim and to come into the wilderness of Si´nai and to encamp in the wilderness; and Israel went camping there in front of the mountain.
<p></p>
</br>3 And Moses went up to the [true] God, and Jehovah began to call to him out of the mountain, saying: “This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and to tell the sons of Israel,
</br>4 ‘YOU yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, that I might carry YOU on wings of eagles and bring YOU to myself.
</br>5 And now if YOU will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then YOU will certainly become my special property out of all [other] peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me.
</br>6 And YOU yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the sons of Israel.”
<p></p>
</br>7 So Moses came and called the older men of the people and set before them all these words that Jehovah had commanded him.
</br>8 After that all the people answered unanimously and said: “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.” Immediately Moses took back the words of the people to Jehovah.
</br>9 At this Jehovah said to Moses: “Look! I am coming to you in a dark cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you, and that in you also they may put faith to time indefinite.” Then Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>10 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Go to the people, and you must sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they must wash their mantles.
</br>11 And they must prove ready for the third day, because on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people upon Mount Si´nai.
</br>12 And you must set bounds for the people round about, saying, ‘Guard yourselves against going up into the mountain, and do not touch the edge of it. Anybody touching the mountain will positively be put to death.
</br>13 No hand is to touch him, because he will positively be stoned or will positively be shot through. Whether beast or man, he will not live.’ At the blowing of the ram’s horn they themselves may come up to the mountain.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he set about sanctifying the people; and they engaged in washing their mantles.
</br>15 Accordingly he said to the people: “Get ready during the three days. Do not YOU men come near a woman.”
<p></p>
</br>16 And on the third day when it became morning it came about that thunders and lightnings began occurring, and a heavy cloud upon the mountain and a very loud sound of a horn, so that all the people who were in the camp began to tremble.
</br>17 Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the [true] God, and they went taking their stand at the base of the mountain.
</br>18 And Mount Si´nai smoked all over, due to the fact that Jehovah came down upon it in fire; and its smoke kept ascending like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling very much.
</br>19 When the sound of the horn became continually louder and louder, Moses began to speak, and the [true] God began to answer him with a voice.
<p></p>
</br>20 So Jehovah came down upon Mount Si´nai to the top of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went on up.
</br>21 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go down, warn the people, that they do not try to break through to Jehovah to take a look and many of them have to fall.
</br>22 And let the priests also who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify themselves, that Jehovah may not break out upon them.”
</br>23 At this Moses said to Jehovah: “The people are not able to come up to Mount Si´nai, because you yourself already warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds for the mountain and make it sacred.’”
</br>24 However, Jehovah said to him: “Go, descend, and you must come up, you and Aaron with you; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, that he may not break out upon them.”
</br>25 Accordingly Moses descended to the people and told them.

</br>4 “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth.
</br>5 You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation, in the case of those who hate me;
</br>6 but exercising loving-kindness toward the thousandth generation in the case of those who love me and keep my commandments.
<p></p>
</br>7 “You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.

</br>8 “Remembering the sabbath day to hold it sacred,
</br>9 you are to render service and you must do all your work six days.
</br>10 But the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your alien resident who is inside your gates.
</br>11 For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day. That is why Jehovah blessed the sabbath day and proceeded to make it sacred.
<p></p>
</br>12 “Honor your father and your mother in order that your days may prove long upon the ground that Jehovah your God is giving you.

</br>18 Now all the people were seeing the thunders and the lightning flashes and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking. When the people got to see it, then they quivered and stood at a distance.
</br>19 And they began to say to Moses: “You speak with us, and let us listen; but let not God speak with us for fear we may die.”
</br>20 So Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid, because for the sake of putting YOU to the test the [true] God has come, and in order that the fear of him may continue before YOUR faces that YOU may not sin.”
</br>21 And the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went near to the dark cloud mass where the [true] God was.
<p></p>
</br>22 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘YOU yourselves have seen that it was from the heavens I spoke with YOU.
</br>23 YOU must not make along with me gods of silver, and YOU must not make gods of gold for yourselves.
</br>24 An altar of ground you are to make for me, and you must sacrifice upon it your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices, your flock and your herd. In every place where I shall cause my name to be remembered I shall come to you and shall certainly bless you.
</br>25 And if you should make an altar of stones for me, you must not build them as hewn stones. In the event that you do wield your chisel upon it, then you will profane it.

</br>4 If his master should give him a wife and she does bear him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will become her master’s and he will go out by himself.

</br>6 then his master must bring him near to the [true] God and must bring him up against the door or the doorpost; and his master must pierce his ear through with an awl, and he must be his slave to time indefinite.

</br>29 But if a bull was formerly in the habit of goring and warning was served on its owner but he would not keep it under guard, and it did put a man or a woman to death, the bull is to be stoned and also its owner is to be put to death.

</br>3 Then Moses came and related to the people all the words of Jehovah and all the judicial decisions, and all the people answered with one voice and said: “All the words that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.”
</br>4 Accordingly Moses wrote down all the words of Jehovah. Then he got up early in the morning and built at the foot of the mountain an altar and twelve pillars corresponding with the twelve tribes of Israel.
</br>5 After that he sent young men of the sons of Israel and they offered up burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as sacrifices, as communion sacrifices to Jehovah.
</br>6 Then Moses took half the blood and put it in bowls, and half the blood he sprinkled upon the altar.
</br>7 Finally he took the book of the covenant and read it in the ears of the people. Then they said: “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do and be obedient.”
</br>8 So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people and said: “Here is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has concluded with YOU as respects all these words.”

</br>13 So Moses and Joshua his minister got up and Moses went up into the mountain of the [true] God.
</br>14 But to the older men he had said: “YOU wait for us in this place until we return to YOU. And, look! Aaron and Hur are with YOU. Whoever has a case at law, let him approach them.”

</br>11 and the anointing oil and the perfumed incense for the sanctuary. According to everything I have commanded you they will do.”
<p></p>
</br>12 And Jehovah said further to Moses:
</br>13 “As for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Especially my sabbaths YOU are to keep, for it is a sign between me and YOU during YOUR generations that YOU may know that I Jehovah am sanctifying YOU.
</br>14 And YOU must keep the sabbath, for it is something holy to YOU. A profaner of it will positively be put to death. In case there is anyone doing work on it, then that soul must be cut off from the midst of his people.
</br>15 Six days may work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest. It is something holy to Jehovah. Anyone doing work on the sabbath day will positively be put to death.
</br>16 And the sons of Israel must keep the sabbath, so as to carry out the sabbath during their generations. It is a covenant to time indefinite.
</br>17 Between me and the sons of Israel it is a sign to time indefinite, because in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and proceeded to refresh himself.’”
<p></p>
</br>18 Now as soon as he had finished speaking with him on Mount Si´nai he proceeded to give Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone written on by God’s finger.

</br>1 Meanwhile the people got to see that Moses was taking a long time about coming down from the mountain. So the people congregated themselves about Aaron and said to him: “Get up, make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because as regards this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt, we certainly do not know what has happened to him.”
</br>2 At this Aaron said to them: “Tear off the gold earrings that are in the ears of YOUR wives, of YOUR sons and of YOUR daughters and bring them to me.”
</br>3 And all the people began tearing off the gold earrings that were in their ears and bringing them to Aaron.
</br>4 Then he took [the gold] from their hands, and he formed it with a graving tool and proceeded to make it into a molten statue of a calf. And they began to say: “This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.”
<p></p>
</br>5 When Aaron got to see this, he went to building an altar before it. Finally Aaron called out and said: “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.”
</br>6 So on the next day they were early in rising, and they began offering up burnt offerings and presenting communion sacrifices. After that the people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to have a good time.
<p></p>
</br>7 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go, descend, because your people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt have acted ruinously.
</br>8 They have turned aside in a hurry from the way I have commanded them to go. They have made a molten statue of a calf for themselves and keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying, ‘This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.’”
</br>9 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “I have looked at this people and here it is a stiff-necked people.
</br>10 So now let me be, that my anger may blaze against them and I may exterminate them, and let me make you into a great nation.”
<p></p>
</br>11 And Moses proceeded to soften the face of Jehovah his God and to say: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?
</br>12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them among the mountains and to exterminate them from the surface of the ground’? Turn from your burning anger and feel regret over the evil against your people.
</br>13 Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, in that you said to them, ‘I shall multiply YOUR seed like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have designated I shall give to YOUR seed, that they may indeed take possession of it to time indefinite.’”
<p></p>
</br>14 And Jehovah began to feel regret over the evil that he had spoken of doing to his people.
<p></p>
</br>15 After that Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, tablets written upon on both their sides. On this side and on that they were written upon.
</br>16 And the tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved upon the tablets.
</br>17 And Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting, and he proceeded to say to Moses: “There is a noise of battle in the camp.”
</br>18 But he said:
@@citp“It is not the sound of the singing over mighty performance,
@@citzAnd it is not the sound of the singing of defeat;
@@citzIt is the sound of other singing that I am hearing.”
<p></p>
</br>19 So it came about that as soon as he got near the camp and could see the calf and the dances, Moses’ anger began to blaze, and he at once threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.
</br>20 Then he took the calf that they had made and he burnt it with fire and crushed it till it was fine, after which he scattered it upon the surface of the waters and made the sons of Israel drink it.
</br>21 After that Moses said to Aaron: “What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon it?”
</br>22 To this Aaron said: “Do not let the anger of my lord blaze. You yourself well know the people, that they are evil-inclined.
</br>23 So they said to me, ‘Make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because as regards this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt, we certainly do not know what has happened to him.’
</br>24 Hence I said to them, ‘Who have any gold? They must tear it off themselves that they may give it to me.’ And I proceeded to throw it into the fire and this calf came on out.”
<p></p>
</br>25 And Moses got to see that the people went unrestrained, because Aaron had let them go unrestrained for a disgrace among their opposers.
</br>26 Then Moses took his stand in the gate of the camp and said: “Who is on Jehovah’s side? To me!” And all the sons of Le´vi began gathering themselves to him.
</br>27 He now said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Put each one of YOU his sword on his side. Pass through and return from gate to gate in the camp and kill each one his brother and each one his fellow and each one his intimate acquaintance.’”
</br>28 And the sons of Le´vi proceeded to do as Moses had said, so that there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men.
</br>29 And Moses went on to say: “Fill YOUR hand today with power for Jehovah, because each one of YOU is against his own son and his own brother, and that he may confer a blessing upon YOU today.”
<p></p>
</br>30 And it came about on the very next day that Moses proceeded to say to the people: “YOU—YOU have sinned with a great sin, and now I shall go up to Jehovah. Perhaps I can make amends for YOUR sin.”
</br>31 So Moses returned to Jehovah and said: “Ah, but this people has sinned with a great sin, in that they made a god of gold for themselves!
</br>32 But now if you will pardon their sin,—and if not, wipe me out, please, from your book that you have written.”
</br>33 However, Jehovah said to Moses: “Whoever has sinned against me, I shall wipe him out of my book.
</br>34 And now, come, lead the people to where I have spoken to you of. Look! My angel will go ahead of you, and on the day of my bringing punishment I shall certainly bring punishment upon them for their sin.”
</br>35 And Jehovah began plaguing the people because they had made the calf, which Aaron had made.

</br>33 :

<p></p>
</br>1 And Jehovah said further to Moses: “Go, move up from here, you and the people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt, to the land about which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘To your seed I shall give it.’
</br>2 And I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Ca´naan·ites, the Am´or·ites, and the Hit´tites and the Per´iz·zites, the Hi´vites and the Jeb´u·sites;
</br>3 to a land flowing with milk and honey, for I shall not go up in the midst of you, because you are a stiff-necked people, that I may not exterminate you on the way.”
<p></p>
</br>4 When the people got to hear this evil word, they began to mourn; and none of them put his ornaments on himself.
</br>5 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘YOU are a stiff-necked people. In one moment I could go up into the midst of you and certainly exterminate you. So now put down your ornaments off yourself, as I want to know what I am going to do to you.’”
</br>6 And the sons of Israel went stripping their ornaments off themselves from Mount Ho´reb onward.
<p></p>
</br>7 As for Moses, he proceeded to take his tent away and he pitched it outside the camp, far away from the camp; and he called it a tent of meeting. And it occurred that everyone inquiring of Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
</br>8 And it occurred that as soon as Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise, and they stationed themselves each one at the entrance of his own tent, and they gazed after Moses until he went into the tent.
</br>9 It also occurred that as soon as Moses had gone into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down, and it stood at the entrance of the tent and he spoke with Moses.
</br>10 And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, and all the people rose and bowed down each one at the entrance of his own tent.
</br>11 And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, just as a man would speak to his fellow. When he returned to the camp, his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, as attendant, would not withdraw from the midst of the tent.
<p></p>
</br>12 Now Moses said to Jehovah: “See, you are saying to me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but you yourself have not let me know whom you will send with me. Moreover, you yourself have said, ‘I do know you by name and, besides, you have found favor in my eyes.’
</br>13 And now, if, please, I have found favor in your eyes, make me know, please, your ways, that I may know you, in order that I may find favor in your eyes. And consider that this nation is your people.”
</br>14 So he said: “My own person will go along and I shall certainly give you rest.”
</br>15 At this he said to him: “If your own person is not going along, do not lead us up from here.
</br>16 And by what, now, will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going along with us, in that I and your people have been made distinct from all the other people who are upon the surface of the ground?”
<p></p>
</br>17 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “This thing, too, of which you have spoken, I shall do, because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by name.”
</br>18 At this he said: “Cause me to see, please, your glory.”
</br>19 But he said: “I myself shall cause all my goodness to pass before your face, and I will declare the name of Jehovah before you; and I will favor the one whom I may favor, and I will show mercy to the one to whom I may show mercy.”
</br>20 And he added: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.”
<p></p>
</br>21 And Jehovah said further: “Here is a place with me, and you must station yourself upon the rock.
</br>22 And it has to occur that while my glory is passing by I must place you in a hole in the rock, and I must put my palm over you as a screen until I have passed by.
</br>23 After that I must take my palm away, and you will indeed see my back. But my face may not be seen.”

<p></p>
</br>1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I must write upon the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets, which you shattered.
</br>2 And get ready for the morning, as you must go up in the morning into Mount Si´nai and station yourself by me there on the top of the mountain.
</br>3 But nobody may go up with you and, too, let nobody else be seen in all the mountain. What is more, no flock or herd should be pasturing in front of that mountain.”
<p></p>
</br>4 Accordingly Moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went on up into Mount Si´nai, just as Jehovah had commanded him, and he was taking the two tablets of stone in his hand.
</br>5 And Jehovah proceeded to come down in the cloud and station himself with him there and declare the name of Jehovah.
</br>6 And Jehovah went passing by before his face and declaring: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth,
</br>7 preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but by no means will he give exemption from punishment, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.”
<p></p>
</br>8 Moses at once hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself.
</br>9 Then he said: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, O Jehovah, let Jehovah, please, go along in the midst of us, because it is a stiff-necked people, and you have to forgive our error and our sin, and you must take us as your possession.”
</br>10 In turn he said: “Here I am concluding a covenant: Before all your people I shall do wonderful things that have never been created in all the earth or among all the nations; and all the people in the midst of whom you are will indeed see the work of Jehovah, because it is a fear-inspiring thing that I am doing with you.
<p></p>
</br>11 “For your part keep what I am commanding you today. Here I am driving out from before you the Am´or·ites and the Ca´naan·ites and the Hit´tites and the Per´iz·zites and the Hi´vites and the Jeb´u·sites.
</br>12 Watch yourself that you do not conclude a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, for fear it may prove itself a snare in your midst.
</br>13 But their altars YOU people are to pull down, and their sacred pillars YOU are to shatter, and their sacred poles YOU are to cut down.
</br>14 For you must not prostrate yourself to another god, because Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, he is a jealous God;
</br>15 for fear that you may conclude a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, as they will certainly have immoral intercourse with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone will be certain to invite you, and you will certainly eat some of his sacrifice.
</br>16 Then you will have to take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will be certain to have immoral intercourse with their gods and make your sons have immoral intercourse with their gods.

</br>17 “You must not make molten idol gods for yourself.

</br>18 “The festival of unfermented cakes you are to keep. You will eat unfermented cakes, just as I have commanded you, seven days at the appointed time in the month of A´bib, because it was in the month of A´bib that you came out of Egypt.

</br>20 And the firstling of an ass you are to redeem with a sheep. But if you will not redeem it, then you must break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you are to redeem. And they must not appear before me empty-handed.

</br>22 “And you will carry on your festival of weeks with the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.
<p></p>
</br>23 “Three times in the year every male of yours is to appear before the [true] Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel.
</br>24 For I shall drive the nations away from before you, and I will make your territory spacious; and nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times in the year.

</br>25 “You must not slaughter along with what is leavened the blood of my sacrifice. And the sacrifice of the festival of the passover should not stay overnight until the morning.

“You must not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.”
<p></p>
</br>27 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Write down for yourself these words, because it is in accordance with these words that I do conclude a covenant with you and Israel.”
</br>28 And he continued there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. He ate no bread and he drank no water. And he proceeded to write upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words.
<p></p>
</br>29 Now it came about when Moses came down from Mount Si´nai that the two tablets of the Testimony were in the hand of Moses when he came down from the mountain, and Moses did not know that the skin of his face emitted rays because of his having spoken with him.
</br>30 When Aaron and all the sons of Israel got to see Moses, why, look! the skin of his face emitted rays and they grew afraid of coming near to him.
<p></p>
</br>31 And Moses proceeded to call them. So Aaron and all the chieftains among the assembly came back to him, and Moses began to speak to them.
</br>32 First after that all the sons of Israel came near to him, and he began commanding them all that Jehovah had spoken with him on Mount Si´nai.
</br>33 When Moses would finish speaking with them, he would put a veil over his face.
</br>34 But when Moses would go in before Jehovah to speak with him, he would take away the veil until his going out. And he went out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he would be commanded.
</br>35 And the sons of Israel saw Moses’ face, that the skin of Moses’ face emitted rays; and Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with him.

</br>1 Later Moses called the entire assembly of the sons of Israel together and said to them: “These are the words that Jehovah has commanded, to do them:
</br>2 Six days may work be done, but on the seventh day it will become something holy to YOU, a sabbath of complete rest to Jehovah. Anybody doing work on it will be put to death.
</br>3 YOU must not light a fire in any of YOUR dwelling places on the sabbath day.”
<p></p>
</br>4 And Moses went on to say to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel: “This is the word that Jehovah has commanded, saying,
</br>5 ‘From among yourselves take up a contribution for Jehovah. Let every willing-hearted one bring it as Jehovah’s contribution, namely, gold and silver and copper
</br>6 and blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine linen and goat’s hair
</br>7 and ram skins dyed red and sealskins and acacia wood
</br>8 and oil for the luminary and balsam oil for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense
</br>9 and onyx stones and setting stones for the eph´od and for the breastpiece.
<p></p>
</br>10 “‘And let all the wise-hearted ones among YOU come and make all that Jehovah has commanded,
</br>11 namely, the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, its hooks and its panel frames, its bars, its pillars and its socket pedestals;
</br>12 the Ark and its poles, the cover and the curtain of the screen;
</br>13 the table and its poles and all its utensils and the showbread;
</br>14 and the lampstand of illumination and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for illumination;
</br>15 and the altar of incense and its poles; and the anointing oil and the perfumed incense; and the screen of the entrance for the tabernacle’s entrance;
</br>16 the altar of burnt offering and the copper grating that is for it, its poles and all its utensils; the basin and its stand;
</br>17 the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals; and the screen of the gate of the courtyard;
</br>18 the tent pins of the tabernacle and the tent pins of the courtyard and their cords;
</br>19 the garments of knitted work for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for acting as priests.’”
<p></p>
</br>20 Accordingly all the assembly of the sons of Israel went out from before Moses.
</br>21 Then they came, everyone whose heart impelled him, and they brought, everyone whose spirit incited him, Jehovah’s contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.
</br>22 And they kept coming, the men along with the women, every willing-hearted one. They brought brooches and earrings and rings and female ornaments, all sorts of articles of gold, that is, everyone who presented the wave offering of gold to Jehovah.
</br>23 And all those with whom there were found blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine linen and goat’s hair and ram skins dyed red and sealskins, brought them.
</br>24 All those contributing the contribution of silver and copper brought Jehovah’s contribution, and all those with whom there was found acacia wood for all the work of the service brought it.
<p></p>
</br>25 And all the women who were wise of heart spun with their hands, and they kept bringing as yarn the blue thread and the wool dyed reddish purple, the coccus scarlet material and the fine linen.
</br>26 And all the women whose hearts impelled them with wisdom spun the goat’s hair.
<p></p>
</br>27 And the chieftains brought onyx stones and setting stones for the eph´od and the breastpiece,
</br>28 and the balsam oil and the oil for illumination and for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense.
</br>29 Every man and woman whose hearts incited them to bring something for all the work that Jehovah had commanded to make by means of Moses did so; the sons of Israel brought a voluntary offering to Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>30 Then Moses said to the sons of Israel: “See, Jehovah has called by name Bez´al·el the son of U´ri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.
</br>31 And he proceeded to fill him with the spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in every sort of craftsmanship
</br>32 and for designing devices, for working in gold and silver and copper,
</br>33 and in working of stones to set them and in working of wood to make ingenious products of every sort.
</br>34 And he has put it into his heart that he should teach, he and O·ho´li·ab the son of A·his´a·mach of the tribe of Dan.
</br>35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart to do all the work of a craftsman and an embroiderer and of a weaver in blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple, in coccus scarlet material and fine linen, and of a loom worker, men doing every sort of work and designing devices.

<p></p>
</br>2 And Moses proceeded to call Bez´al·el and O·ho´li·ab and every wise-hearted man into whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, everyone whose heart impelled him to approach the work in order to do it.
</br>3 Then they took from before Moses all the contribution that the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the holy service so as to do it, and, as for the latter, they still brought to him a voluntary offering morning after morning.
<p></p>
</br>4 And all the wise ones who were doing all the holy work began to come, one man after another, from their work that they were doing,
</br>5 and to say to Moses: “The people are bringing much more than what the service needs for the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done.”
</br>6 So Moses commanded that they should cause an announcement to pass through the camp, saying: “Men and women, do not produce any more stuff for the holy contribution.” With that the people were restrained from bringing it in.
</br>7 And the stuff proved to be enough for all the work to be done, and more than enough.
<p></p>
</br>8 And all the wise-hearted among those doing the work went making the tabernacle, the ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen and blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material; with cherubs, the work of an embroiderer, he made them.
</br>9 The length of each tent cloth was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each tent cloth four cubits. There was one measure for all the tent cloths.
</br>10 Then he joined five tent cloths one to another, and the five other tent cloths he joined one to another.
</br>11 After that he made loops of blue thread upon the edge of the one tent cloth at the junction end. He did the same on the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the other place of junction.
</br>12 He made fifty loops on the one tent cloth, and he made fifty loops on the extremity of the tent cloth that was at the other place of junction, the loops being opposite one another.
</br>13 Finally he made fifty hooks of gold and joined the tent cloths to one another by the hooks, so that it became one tabernacle.
<p></p>
</br>14 And he went on to make tent cloths of goat’s hair for the tent upon the tabernacle. Eleven tent cloths were what he made.
</br>15 The length of each tent cloth was thirty cubits, and the width of each tent cloth four cubits. There was one measure for the eleven tent cloths.
</br>16 Then he joined five tent cloths together by themselves and the six other tent cloths by themselves.
</br>17 Next he made fifty loops upon the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the place of junction, and he made fifty loops upon the edge of the other tent cloth that joined with it.
</br>18 After that he made fifty hooks of copper for joining the tent together to become one piece.
<p></p>
</br>19 And he proceeded to make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and a covering out of sealskins up on top.
<p></p>
</br>20 Then he made the panel frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood, standing on end.
</br>21 Ten cubits was the length of a panel frame, and one cubit and a half the width of each panel frame.
</br>22 Each panel frame had two tenons fitted one to the other. That is the way he did to all the panel frames of the tabernacle.
</br>23 So he made the panel frames for the tabernacle, twenty panel frames for the side toward the Neg´eb, to the south.
</br>24 And he made forty socket pedestals of silver for beneath the twenty panel frames, two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame with its two tenons and two socket pedestals beneath the other panel frame with its two tenons.
</br>25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, the northern side, he made twenty panel frames
</br>26 and their forty socket pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame and two socket pedestals beneath the other panel frame.
<p></p>
</br>27 And for the rear sections of the tabernacle to the west he made six panel frames.
</br>28 And he made two panel frames as corner posts of the tabernacle on its two rear sections.
</br>29 And they proved to be duplicates at the bottom and together they came to be twins to the top of each one at the first ring. That is what he did to them both, to the two corner posts.
</br>30 So they amounted to eight panel frames and their socket pedestals of silver to sixteen, two socket pedestals next to two socket pedestals beneath each panel frame.
<p></p>
</br>31 And he went on to make bars of acacia wood, five for the panel frames of the one side of the tabernacle
</br>32 and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the tabernacle and five bars for the panel frames of the tabernacle for the two rear sections to the west.
</br>33 Then he made the middle bar to run through at the middle of the panel frames from one end to the other.
</br>34 And he overlaid the panel frames with gold, and he made their rings of gold as supports for the bars, and he went on to overlay the bars with gold.
<p></p>
</br>35 And he proceeded to make a curtain of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen. With the work of an embroiderer he made it with cherubs.
</br>36 Then he made for it four acacia pillars and overlaid them with gold, their pegs being of gold, and cast four socket pedestals of silver for them.
</br>37 And he went on to make a screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver,
</br>38 and its five pillars and their pegs. And he overlaid their tops and their joints with gold, but their five socket pedestals were of copper.

</br>3 After that he cast four rings of gold for it, for above its four feet, with two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.

</br>7 He further made two cherubs of gold. Of hammered work he made them on both ends of the cover.
</br>8 One cherub was on the end over there, and the other cherub on the end over here. He made the cherubs on the cover on both of its ends.
</br>9 And they came to be cherubs spreading out two wings upward, screening over the cover with their wings, and their faces were one to the other. The faces of the cherubs proved to be toward the cover.

</br>10 And he proceeded to make the table of acacia wood. Two cubits was its length, and a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height.
</br>11 Then he overlaid it with pure gold and made a border of gold round about for it.
</br>12 Next he made for it a rim of a handbreadth round about and made a border of gold for its rim round about.
</br>13 Further, he cast four rings of gold for it and put the rings upon the four corners that were for the four feet.
</br>14 The rings proved to be near the rim, as supports for the poles for carrying the table.
</br>15 Then he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold for carrying the table.
</br>16 After that he made the utensils that are upon the table, its dishes and its cups and its bowls and its pitchers with which [libations] would be poured, out of pure gold.
<p></p>
</br>17 Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work he made the lampstand. Its sides and its branches, its cups, its knobs and its blossoms proceeded out of it.
</br>18 And six branches were running out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand out from its one side and three branches of the lampstand out from its other side.
</br>19 Three cups shaped like flowers of almond were on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating; and three cups shaped like flowers of almond were on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. That is the way it was for the six branches running out from the lampstand.
</br>20 And on the lampstand there were four cups shaped like flowers of almond, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating.
</br>21 And the knob under two branches was out of it, and the knob under two other branches was out of it, and the knob under two more branches was out of it, for the six branches running out from the lampstand.
</br>22 Their knobs and their branches proceeded out from it. All of it was one piece of hammered work, of pure gold.
</br>23 Then he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its fire holders out of pure gold.
</br>24 Of a talent of pure gold he made it and all its utensils.
<p></p>
</br>25 He now made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. A cubit was its length and a cubit its width, it being foursquare, and two cubits was its height. Its horns proceeded out of it.
</br>26 Then he overlaid it with pure gold, its top surface and its sides round about and its horns, and he made a border of gold round about for it.
</br>27 And he made for it two rings of gold down below its border upon two of its sides, upon two opposite sides of it, as supports for the poles with which to carry it.
</br>28 After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
</br>29 He made additionally the holy anointing oil and the pure, perfumed incense, the work of an ointment maker.

</br>1 And he went on to make the altar of burnt offering out of acacia wood. Five cubits was its length, and five cubits its width, it being foursquare, and three cubits was its height.
</br>2 Then he made its horns upon its four corners. Its horns proceeded out of it. Next he overlaid it with copper.
</br>3 After that he made all the utensils of the altar, the cans and the shovels and the bowls, the forks and the fire holders. All its utensils he made of copper.
</br>4 He further made for the altar a grating, a network of copper, under its rim, down toward its center.
</br>5 Then he cast four rings on the four extremities near the grating of copper, as supports for the poles.
</br>6 After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with copper.
</br>7 Then he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it with them. He made it a hollow chest of planks.
<p></p>
</br>8 Then he made the basin of copper and its stand of copper, by the use of the mirrors of the women servants who did organized service at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
<p></p>
</br>9 And he proceeded to make the courtyard. For the side toward the Neg´eb, to the south, the hangings of the courtyard were of fine twisted linen, for a hundred cubits.
</br>10 Their twenty pillars and their twenty socket pedestals were of copper. The pegs of the pillars and their joints were of silver.
</br>11 Also, for the north side there were a hundred cubits. Their twenty pillars and their twenty socket pedestals were of copper. The pegs of the pillars and their joints were of silver.
</br>12 But for the west side the hangings were for fifty cubits. Their pillars were ten and their socket pedestals ten. The pegs of the pillars and their joints were of silver.
</br>13 And for the east side toward the sunrising there were fifty cubits.
</br>14 The hangings were for fifteen cubits to the one wing. Their pillars were three and their socket pedestals three.
</br>15 And for the other wing, on this as well as that side, of the gate of the courtyard, the hangings were for fifteen cubits. Their pillars were three and their socket pedestals three.
</br>16 All the hangings of the courtyard round about were of fine twisted linen.
</br>17 And the socket pedestals for the pillars were of copper. The pegs of the pillars and their joints were of silver and the overlaying of their tops was of silver, and there were silver joinings for all the pillars of the courtyard.
<p></p>
</br>18 And the screen of the gate of the courtyard was the work of a weaver, of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen, and twenty cubits was the length, and the height throughout its extent was five cubits equally with the hangings of the courtyard.
</br>19 And their four pillars and their four socket pedestals were of copper. Their pegs were of silver and the overlaying of their heads and their joints were of silver.
</br>20 And all the tent pins for the tabernacle and for the courtyard round about were of copper.
<p></p>
</br>21 The following are the things inventoried of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which was inventoried at the command of Moses, as the service of the Levites under the guidance of Ith´a·mar the son of Aaron the priest.
</br>22 And Bez´al·el the son of U´ri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah did all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
</br>23 And with him was O·ho´li·ab the son of A·his´a·mach of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman and embroiderer and weaver in the blue thread and the wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine linen.
<p></p>
</br>24 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the holy place came to the amount of the gold of the wave offering, twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels by the shekel of the holy place.
</br>25 And the silver of the ones registered of the assembly was a hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels by the shekel of the holy place.
</br>26 The half shekel for an individual was the half of a shekel by the shekel of the holy place, for every man who was passing over to those who were registered from twenty years of age and upward, amounting to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
<p></p>
</br>27 And a hundred talents of silver went into the casting of the socket pedestals of the holy place and the socket pedestals of the curtain. A hundred socket pedestals equaled a hundred talents, a talent to a socket pedestal.
</br>28 And out of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made pegs for the pillars and overlaid their tops and joined them together.
<p></p>
</br>29 And the copper of the wave offering was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels.
</br>30 And with this he proceeded to make the socket pedestals of the entrance of the tent of meeting and the copper altar and the copper grating that belonged to it, and all the utensils of the altar,
</br>31 and the socket pedestals of the courtyard round about, and the socket pedestals of the gate of the courtyard, and all the tent pins of the tabernacle and all the tent pins of the courtyard round about.

</br>1 And out of the blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material they made garments of knitted work for ministering in the holy place. So they made the holy garments that were for Aaron, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>2 Accordingly he made the eph´od of gold, blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen.
</br>3 Then they beat plates of gold to thin sheets, and he cut out threads to work in among the blue thread and the wool dyed reddish purple and the coccus scarlet material and the fine linen, as the work of an embroiderer.
</br>4 They made shoulder pieces for it that were joined. It was joined at its two extremities.
</br>5 And the girdle, which was upon it for tying it close, was of the same material according to its workmanship, of gold, blue thread, and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>6 Then they made the onyx stones set with settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a seal according to the names of the sons of Israel.
</br>7 So he placed them upon the shoulder pieces of the eph´od as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
</br>8 Then he made the breastpiece with the workmanship of an embroiderer, like the workmanship of the eph´od, out of gold, blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen.
</br>9 It proved to be foursquare when doubled. They made the breastpiece, when doubled, a span of the hand in its length and a span in its width.
</br>10 Then they filled it with four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz and emerald was the first row.
</br>11 And the second row was turquoise, sapphire and jasper.
</br>12 And the third row was lesh´em stone, agate and amethyst.
</br>13 And the fourth row was chrys´o·lite and onyx and jade. They were set with settings of gold in their fillings.
</br>14 And the stones were according to the names of the sons of Israel. They were twelve according to their names, with the engravings of a seal, each according to its name for the twelve tribes.
<p></p>
</br>15 And they proceeded to make upon the breastpiece wreathed chains, in ropework, of pure gold.
</br>16 Then they made two settings of gold and two rings of gold and put the two rings upon the two extremities of the breastpiece.
</br>17 After that they put the two ropes of gold through the two rings at the extremities of the breastpiece.
</br>18 And they put the two ends of the two ropes through the two settings. Then they put them upon the shoulder pieces of the eph´od, at the forefront of it.
</br>19 Next they made two rings of gold and set them at the two extremities of the breastpiece upon its edge that is on the side toward the eph´od inward.
</br>20 Then they made two rings of gold and put them upon the two shoulder pieces of the eph´od from below, on its forefront, near its place of joining, above the girdle of the eph´od.
</br>21 Finally they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the eph´od with a blue string, that it might continue above the girdle of the eph´od and the breastpiece might not get displaced from on top the eph´od, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>22 Then he made the sleeveless coat of the eph´od, the workmanship of a loom worker, all of blue thread.
</br>23 And the opening of the sleeveless coat was in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail. Its opening had a border round about that it might not be torn.
</br>24 Then they made upon the hem of the sleeveless coat pomegranates of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material, twisted together.
</br>25 Further, they made bells of pure gold and put the bells in between the pomegranates upon the hem of the sleeveless coat round about, in between the pomegranates;
</br>26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate upon the hem of the sleeveless coat round about, for ministering, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>27 Next they made the robes of fine linen, the workmanship of a loom worker, for Aaron and his sons,
</br>28 and the turban of fine linen and the ornamental headgears of fine linen and the linen drawers of fine twisted linen,
</br>29 and the sash of fine twisted linen and blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material, the work of a weaver, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>30 Finally they made the shining plate, the holy sign of dedication, out of pure gold and inscribed upon it an inscription with the engravings of a seal: “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.”
</br>31 Then they put a string of blue thread to it in order to put it upon the turban up above, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>32 So the work for the tabernacle of the tent of meeting all came to its completion, in that the sons of Israel kept doing according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.
<p></p>
</br>33 And they proceeded to bring the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its panel frames, its bars and its pillars and its socket pedestals,
</br>34 and its covering of ram skins dyed red and its covering of sealskins and the curtain of the screen,
</br>35 and the ark of the testimony and its poles and the cover,
</br>36 the table, all its utensils and the showbread,
</br>37 the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps, the row of lamps, and all its utensils and the oil of illumination,
</br>38 and the altar of gold and the anointing oil and the perfumed incense and the screen for the entrance of the tent,
</br>39 the altar of copper and the grating of copper that belonged to it, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand,
</br>40 the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals and the screen for the gate of the courtyard, its tent cords and its tent pins and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting,
</br>41 the garments of knitted work for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for acting as priests.
<p></p>
</br>42 According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, that was the way the sons of Israel did all the service.
</br>43 And Moses got to see all the work, and, look! they had done it just as Jehovah had commanded. That was the way they had done. Consequently Moses blessed them.

<p></p>
</br>1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
</br>2 “On the day of the first month, on the first of the month, you are to set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
</br>3 And you must place the ark of the testimony in it and shut off approach to the Ark with the curtain.
</br>4 And you must bring the table in and set its arrangement in order, and you must bring in the lampstand and light up its lamps.
</br>5 And you must put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony and put the screen of the entrance for the tabernacle in place.
<p></p>
</br>6 “And you must put the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,
</br>7 and you must put the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.
</br>8 And you must place the courtyard round about and put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard.
</br>9 And you must take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and you must sanctify it and all its utensils, and so it must become something holy.
</br>10 And you must anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and sanctify the altar, and so it must become a most holy altar.
</br>11 And you must anoint the basin and its stand and sanctify it.
<p></p>
</br>12 “Then you must bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
</br>13 And you must clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him, and so he must act as priest to me.
</br>14 After that you will bring his sons near and you must clothe them with robes.
</br>15 And you must anoint them just as you anointed their father, and so they must act as priests to me, and their anointing must serve continually for them as a priesthood to time indefinite during their generations.”
<p></p>
</br>16 And Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.
<p></p>
</br>17 Accordingly it came about that in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.
</br>18 When Moses proceeded to set up the tabernacle, he went putting its socket pedestals down and placing its panel frames and putting its bars in and setting up its pillars.
</br>19 Then he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent above upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>20 After that he took the Testimony and put it into the Ark and placed the poles on the Ark and put the cover above upon the Ark.
</br>21 Then he brought the Ark into the tabernacle and put the curtain of the screen in place and shut off approach to the ark of the testimony, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>22 Next he put the table in the tent of meeting on the side of the tabernacle to the north outside the curtain,
</br>23 and he arranged the row of bread upon it before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>24 Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting in front of the table, on the side of the tabernacle to the south.
</br>25 He then lit up the lamps before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>26 He next placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain,
</br>27 that he might make perfumed incense smoke upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>28 Finally he put the screen of the entrance of the tabernacle in place.
<p></p>
</br>29 And he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, that he might offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>30 Then he placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
</br>31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet at it.
</br>32 When they went into the tent of meeting and when they went near to the altar they would wash, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>33 Finally he set up the courtyard round about the tabernacle and the altar and put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard.
<p></p>
So Moses finished the work.
</br>34 And the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.
</br>35 And Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting, because the cloud resided over it and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.
<p></p>
</br>36 And when the cloud lifted itself up from over the tabernacle the sons of Israel would break camp during all their stages of journey.
</br>37 However, if the cloud did not lift itself up, then they would not break camp until the day when it lifted itself up.
</br>38 For Jehovah’s cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and a fire continued upon it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their stages of journey.
