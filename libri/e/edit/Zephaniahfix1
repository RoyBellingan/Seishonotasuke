</br>1 The word of Jehovah that occurred to Zeph·a·ni´ah the son of Cush´i the son of Ged·a·li´ah the son of Am·a·ri´ah the son of Hez·e·ki´ah in the days of Jo·si´ah the son of A´mon the king of Judah:
<p></p>
</br>2 “I shall without fail finish everything off the surface of the ground,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>3 “I shall finish off earthling man and beast. I shall finish off the flying creature of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked ones; and I will cut off mankind from the surface of the ground,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
</br>4 “And I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and I will cut off from this place the remaining ones of the Ba´al, the name of the foreign-god priests along with the priests,
</br>5 and those who are bowing down upon the roofs to the army of the heavens, and those who are bowing down, making sworn oaths to Jehovah and making sworn oaths by Mal´cam;
</br>6 and those who are drawing back from following Jehovah and who have not sought Jehovah and have not inquired of him.”
<p></p>
</br>7 Keep silence before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is near, for Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; he has sanctified his invited ones.
<p></p>
</br>8 “And it must occur on the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice that I will give attention to the princes, and to the sons of the king, and to all those wearing foreign attire.
</br>9 And I will give attention to everyone that is climbing upon the platform in that day, those who are filling the house of their masters with violence and deception.
</br>10 And there must occur on that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “the sound of an outcry from the Fish Gate, and a howling from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
</br>11 Howl, YOU inhabitants of Mak´tesh, for all the people who are tradesmen have been silenced; all those weighing out silver have been cut off.
<p></p>
</br>12 “And it must occur at that time that I shall carefully search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will give attention to the men who are congealing upon their dregs [and] who are saying in their heart, ‘Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do bad.’
</br>13 And their wealth must come to be for pillage and their houses for a desolate waste. And they will build houses, but they will not have occupancy; and they will plant vineyards, but they will not drink the wine of them.
<p></p>
</br>14 “The great day of Jehovah is near. It is near, and there is a hurrying [of it] very much. The sound of the day of Jehovah is bitter. There a mighty man is letting out a cry.
</br>15 That day is a day of fury, a day of distress and of anguish, a day of storm and of desolation, a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick gloom,
</br>16 a day of horn and of alarm signal, against the fortified cities and against the high corner towers.
</br>17 And I will cause distress to mankind, and they will certainly walk like blind men; because it is against Jehovah that they have sinned. And their blood will actually be poured out like dust, and their bowels like the dung.
</br>18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s fury; but by the fire of his zeal the whole earth will be devoured, because he will make an extermination, indeed a terrible one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.”

</br>1 Gather yourselves together, yes, do the gathering, O nation not paling in shame.
</br>2 Before [the] statute gives birth to [anything], [before the] day has passed by just like chaff, before there comes upon YOU people the burning anger of Jehovah, before there comes upon YOU the day of Jehovah’s anger,
</br>3 seek Jehovah, all YOU meek ones of the earth, who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably YOU may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.
</br>4 For, as regards Ga´za, an abandoned [city] is what she will become; and Ash´ke·lon is to be a desolate waste. As regards Ash´dod, at high noon they will drive her out; and as regards Ek´ron, she will be uprooted.
<p></p>
</br>5 “Woe to those inhabiting the region of the sea, the nation of Cher´e·thites! The word of Jehovah is against YOU people. O Ca´naan, the land of the Phi·lis´tines, I will also destroy you, so that there will be no inhabitant.
</br>6 And the region of the sea must become pasture grounds, [with] wells for shepherds and stone pens for sheep.
</br>7 And it must become a region for the remaining ones of the house of Judah. Upon them they will feed. In the houses of Ash´ke·lon, in the evening, they will lie stretched out. For Jehovah their God will turn his attention to them and certainly gather back the captive ones of them.”
<p></p>
</br>8 “I have heard the reproach by Mo´ab and the abusive words of the sons of Am´mon, with which they have reproached my people and kept putting on great airs against their territory.
</br>9 Therefore, as I am alive,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, “Mo´ab herself will become just like Sod´om, and the sons of Am´mon like Go·mor´rah, a place possessed by nettles, and a salt pit, and a desolate waste, even to time indefinite. The remaining ones of my people will plunder them, and the remnant of my own nation will take possession of them.
</br>10 This is what they will have instead of their pride, because they reproached and kept putting on great airs against the people of Jehovah of armies.
</br>11 Jehovah will be fear-inspiring against them; for he will certainly emaciate all the gods of the earth, and people will bow down to him, each one from his place, all the islands of the nations.
<p></p>
</br>12 “YOU also, YOU E·thi·o´pi·ans, YOU yourselves will be people slain by my sword.
<p></p>
</br>13 “And he will stretch out his hand toward the north, and he will destroy As·syr´i·a. And he will make Nin´e·veh a desolate waste, a waterless region like the wilderness.
</br>14 And in the midst of her, droves will certainly lie stretched out, all the wild animals of a nation. Both pelican and porcupine will spend the night right among her pillar capitals. A voice will keep singing in the window. There will be devastation at the threshold; for he will certainly lay bare the very wainscoting.
</br>15 This is the exultant city that was sitting in security, that was saying in her heart, ‘I am, and there is nobody else.’ O how she has become an object of astonishment, a place for the wild animals to lie stretched out! Everyone passing along by her will whistle; he will wag his hand.”

</br>1 Woe to her that is rebelling and polluting herself, the oppressive city!
</br>2 She did not listen to a voice; she did not accept discipline. In Jehovah she did not trust. To her God she did not draw near.
</br>3 Her princes in the midst of her were roaring lions. Her judges were evening wolves that did not gnaw [bones] till the morning.
</br>4 Her prophets were insolent, were men of treachery. Her priests themselves profaned what was holy; they did violence to [the] law.
</br>5 Jehovah was righteous in the midst of her; he would do no unrighteousness. Morning by morning he kept giving his own judicial decision. At daylight it did not prove lacking. But the unrighteous one was knowing no shame.
<p></p>
</br>6 “I cut off nations; their corner towers were desolated. I devastated their streets, so that there was no one passing through. Their cities were laid waste, so that there was no man, so that there was no inhabitant.
</br>7 I said, ‘Surely you will fear me; you will accept discipline’; so that her dwelling might not be cut off—all that I must call to account against her. Truly they acted promptly in making all their dealings ruinous.
<p></p>
</br>8 “‘Therefore keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘till the day of my rising up to [the] booty, for my judicial decision is to gather nations, for me to collect together kingdoms, in order to pour out upon them my denunciation, all my burning anger; for by the fire of my zeal all the earth will be devoured.
</br>9 For then I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder.’
<p></p>
</br>10 “From the region of the rivers of E·thi·o´pi·a the ones entreating me, [namely,] the daughter of my scattered ones, will bring a gift to me.
</br>11 In that day you will not be ashamed because of all your dealings with which you transgressed against me, for then I shall remove from the midst of you your haughtily exultant ones; and you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain.
</br>12 And I shall certainly let remain in the midst of you a people humble and lowly, and they will actually take refuge in the name of Jehovah.
</br>13 As regards the remaining ones of Israel, they will do no unrighteousness, nor speak a lie, nor will there be found in their mouths a tricky tongue; for they themselves will feed and actually lie stretched out, and there will be no one making [them] tremble.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Joyfully cry out, O daughter of Zion! Break out in cheers, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
</br>15 Jehovah has removed the judgments upon you. He has turned away your enemy. The king of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of you. You will fear calamity no more.
</br>16 In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, O Zion. May your hands not drop down.
</br>17 Jehovah your God is in the midst of you. As a mighty One, he will save. He will exult over you with rejoicing. He will become silent in his love. He will be joyful over you with happy cries.
<p></p>
</br>18 “The ones grief-stricken in absence from [your] festal season I shall certainly gather together; absent from you they happened to be, because of bearing reproach on her account.
</br>19 Here I am acting against all those afflicting you, at that time; and I will save her that is limping, and her that is dispersed I shall collect together. And I will set them as a praise and as a name in all the land of their shame.
</br>20 At that time I shall bring YOU people in, even in the time of my collecting YOU together. For I shall make YOU people to be a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I gather back YOUR captive ones before YOUR eyes,” Jehovah has said.
