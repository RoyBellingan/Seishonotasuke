</br>1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through God’s will, and Sos´the·nes our brother
</br>2 to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, to YOU who have been sanctified in union with Christ Jesus, called to be holy ones, together with all who everywhere are calling upon the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:
<p></p>
</br>3 May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.
<p></p>
</br>4 I always thank God for YOU in view of the undeserved kindness of God given to YOU in Christ Jesus;
</br>5 that in everything YOU have been enriched in him, in full ability to speak and in full knowledge,
</br>6 even as the witness about the Christ has been rendered firm among YOU,
</br>7 so that YOU do not fall short in any gift at all, while YOU are eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</br>8 He will also make YOU firm to the end, that YOU may be open to no accusation in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</br>9 God is faithful, by whom YOU were called into a sharing with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
<p></p>
</br>10 Now I exhort YOU, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that YOU should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among YOU, but that YOU may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.
</br>11 For the disclosure was made to me about YOU, my brothers, by those of [the house of] Chlo´e, that dissensions exist among YOU.
</br>12 What I mean is this, that each one of YOU says: “I belong to Paul,” “But I to A·pol´los,” “But I to Ce´phas,” “But I to Christ.”
</br>13 The Christ exists divided. Paul was not impaled for YOU, was he? Or were YOU baptized in the name of Paul?
</br>14 I am thankful I baptized none of YOU except Cris´pus and Ga´ius,
</br>15 so that no one may say that YOU were baptized in my name.
</br>16 Yes, I also baptized the household of Steph´a·nas. As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anybody else.
</br>17 For Christ dispatched me, not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news, not with wisdom of speech, that the torture stake of the Christ should not be made useless.
<p></p>
</br>18 For the speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is God’s power.
</br>19 For it is written: “I will make the wisdom of the wise [men] perish, and the intelligence of the intellectual [men] I will shove aside.”
</br>20 Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? Where the debater of this system of things? Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish?
</br>21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not get to know God, God saw good through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing.
<p></p>
</br>22 For both the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks look for wisdom;
</br>23 but we preach Christ impaled, to the Jews a cause for stumbling but to the nations foolishness;
</br>24 however, to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
</br>25 Because a foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men.
<p></p>
</br>26 For YOU behold his calling of YOU, brothers, that not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth;
</br>27 but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame;
</br>28 and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things looked down upon, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are,
</br>29 in order that no flesh might boast in the sight of God.
</br>30 But it is due to him that YOU are in union with Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom;
</br>31 that it may be just as it is written: “He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.”

</br>1 And so I, when I came to YOU, brothers, did not come with an extravagance of speech or of wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to YOU.
</br>2 For I decided not to know anything among YOU except Jesus Christ, and him impaled.
</br>3 And I came to YOU in weakness and in fear and with much trembling;
</br>4 and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
</br>5 that YOUR faith might be, not in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.
<p></p>
</br>6 Now we speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this system of things nor that of the rulers of this system of things, who are to come to nothing.
</br>7 But we speak God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory.
</br>8 This [wisdom] not one of the rulers of this system of things came to know, for if they had known [it] they would not have impaled the glorious Lord.
</br>9 But just as it is written: “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him.”
</br>10 For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.
<p></p>
</br>11 For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man that is in him? So, too, no one has come to know the things of God, except the spirit of God.
</br>12 Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God.
</br>13 These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by [the] spirit, as we combine spiritual [matters] with spiritual [words].
<p></p>
</br>14 But a physical man does not receive the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know [them], because they are examined spiritually.
</br>15 However, the spiritual man examines indeed all things, but he himself is not examined by any man.
</br>16 For “who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, that he may instruct him?” But we do have the mind of Christ.

</br>1 And so, brothers, I was not able to speak to YOU as to spiritual men, but as to fleshly men, as to babes in Christ.
</br>2 I fed YOU milk, not something to eat, for YOU were not yet strong enough. In fact, neither are YOU strong enough now,
</br>3 for YOU are yet fleshly. For whereas there are jealousy and strife among YOU, are YOU not fleshly and are YOU not walking as men do?
</br>4 For when one says: “I belong to Paul,” but another says: “I to A·pol´los,” are YOU not simply men?
<p></p>
</br>5 What, then, is A·pol´los? Yes, what is Paul? Ministers through whom YOU became believers, even as the Lord granted each one.
</br>6 I planted, A·pol´los watered, but God kept making [it] grow;
</br>7 so that neither is he that plants anything nor is he that waters, but God who makes [it] grow.
</br>8 Now he that plants and he that waters are one, but each [person] will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
</br>9 For we are God’s fellow workers. YOU people are God’s field under cultivation, God’s building.
<p></p>
</br>10 According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me, as a wise director of works I laid a foundation, but someone else is building on it. But let each one keep watching how he is building on it.
</br>11 For no man can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
</br>12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood materials, hay, stubble,
</br>13 each one’s work will become manifest, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire; and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one’s is.
</br>14 If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward;
</br>15 if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, [it will be] as through fire.
<p></p>
</br>16 Do YOU not know that YOU people are God’s temple, and that the spirit of God dwells in YOU?
</br>17 If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] YOU people are.
<p></p>
</br>18 Let no one be seducing himself: If anyone among YOU thinks he is wise in this system of things, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
</br>19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written: “He catches the wise in their own cunning.”
</br>20 And again: “Jehovah knows that the reasonings of the wise men are futile.”
</br>21 Hence let no one be boasting in men; for all things belong to YOU,
</br>22 whether Paul or A·pol´los or Ce´phas or the world or life or death or things now here or things to come, all things belong to YOU;
</br>23 in turn YOU belong to Christ; Christ, in turn, belongs to God.

</br>1 Let a man so appraise us as being subordinates of Christ and stewards of sacred secrets of God.
</br>2 Besides, in this case, what is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful.
</br>3 Now to me it is a very trivial matter that I should be examined by YOU or by a human tribunal. Even I do not examine myself.
</br>4 For I am not conscious of anything against myself. Yet by this I am not proved righteous, but he that examines me is Jehovah.
</br>5 Hence do not judge anything before the due time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring the secret things of darkness to light and make the counsels of the hearts manifest, and then each one will have his praise come to him from God.
<p></p>
</br>6 Now, brothers, these things I have transferred so as to apply to myself and A·pol´los for YOUR good, that in our case YOU may learn the [rule]: “Do not go beyond the things that are written,” in order that YOU may not be puffed up individually in favor of the one against the other.
</br>7 For who makes you to differ from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, now, you did indeed receive [it], why do you boast as though you did not receive [it]?
<p></p>
</br>8 YOU men already have YOUR fill, do YOU? YOU are rich already, are YOU? YOU have begun ruling as kings without us, have YOU? And I wish indeed that YOU had begun ruling as kings, that we also might rule with YOU as kings.
</br>9 For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men appointed to death, because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.
</br>10 We are fools because of Christ, but YOU are discreet in Christ; we are weak, but YOU are strong; YOU are in good repute, but we are in dishonor.
</br>11 Down to this very hour we continue to hunger and also to thirst and to be scantily clothed and to be knocked about and to be homeless
</br>12 and to toil, working with our own hands. When being reviled, we bless; when being persecuted, we bear up;
</br>13 when being defamed, we entreat; we have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.
<p></p>
</br>14 I am writing these things, not to shame YOU, but to admonish YOU as my beloved children.
</br>15 For though YOU may have ten thousand tutors in Christ, [YOU] certainly [do] not [have] many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have become YOUR father through the good news.
</br>16 I entreat YOU, therefore, become imitators of me.
</br>17 That is why I am sending Timothy to YOU, as he is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord; and he will put YOU in mind of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus, just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.
<p></p>
</br>18 Some are puffed up as though I were in fact not coming to YOU.
</br>19 But I will come to YOU shortly, if Jehovah wills, and I shall get to know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but [their] power.
</br>20 For the kingdom of God [lies] not in speech, but in power.

</br>1 Actually fornication is reported among YOU, and such fornication as is not even among the nations, that a wife a certain [man] has of [his] father.
</br>2 And are YOU puffed up, and did YOU not rather mourn, in order that the man that committed this deed should be taken away from YOUR midst?
</br>3 I for one, although absent in body but present in spirit, have certainly judged already, as if I were present, the man who has worked in such a way as this,
</br>4 that in the name of our Lord Jesus, when YOU are gathered together, also my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus,
</br>5 YOU hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
<p></p>
</br>6 YOUR [cause for] boasting is not fine. Do YOU not know that a little leaven ferments the whole lump?
</br>7 Clear away the old leaven, that YOU may be a new lump, according as YOU are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed.
</br>8 Consequently let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.
<p></p>
</br>9 In my letter I wrote YOU to quit mixing in company with fornicators,
</br>10 not [meaning] entirely with the fornicators of this world or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, YOU would actually have to get out of the world.
</br>11 But now I am writing YOU to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.
</br>12 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do YOU not judge those inside,

</br>2 Or do YOU not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by YOU, are YOU unfit to try very trivial matters?
</br>3 Do YOU not know that we shall judge angels? Why, then, not matters of this life?
</br>4 If, then, YOU do have matters of this life to be tried, is it the men looked down upon in the congregation that YOU put in as judges?
</br>5 I am speaking to move YOU to shame. Is it true that there is not one wise man among YOU that will be able to judge between his brothers,
</br>6 but brother goes to court with brother, and that before unbelievers?
<p></p>
</br>7 Really, then, it means altogether a defeat for YOU that YOU are having lawsuits with one another. Why do YOU not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why do YOU not rather let yourselves be defrauded?
</br>8 To the contrary, YOU wrong and defraud, and YOUR brothers at that.
<p></p>
</br>9 What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men,
</br>10 nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.

</br>12 All things are lawful for me; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful for me; but I will not let myself be brought under authority by anything.

</br>14 But God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up out of [death] through his power.

</br>15 Do YOU not know that YOUR bodies are members of Christ? Shall I, then, take the members of the Christ away and make them members of a harlot? Never may that happen!

</br>17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
</br>18 Flee from fornication. Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but he that practices fornication is sinning against his own body.
</br>19 What! Do YOU not know that the body of YOU people is [the] temple of the holy spirit within YOU, which YOU have from God? Also, YOU do not belong to yourselves,

</br>1 Now concerning the things about which YOU wrote, it is well for a man not to touch a woman;
</br>2 yet, because of prevalence of fornication, let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband.
</br>3 Let the husband render to [his] wife her due; but let the wife also do likewise to [her] husband.
</br>4 The wife does not exercise authority over her own body, but her husband does; likewise, also, the husband does not exercise authority over his own body, but his wife does.
</br>5 Do not be depriving each other [of it], except by mutual consent for an appointed time, that YOU may devote time to prayer and may come together again, that Satan may not keep tempting YOU for YOUR lack of self-regulation.
</br>6 However, I say this by way of concession, not in the way of a command.
</br>7 But I wish all men were as I myself am. Nevertheless, each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that way.
<p></p>
</br>8 Now I say to the unmarried persons and the widows, it is well for them that they remain even as I am.
</br>9 But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed [with passion].
<p></p>
</br>10 To the married people I give instructions, yet not I but the Lord, that a wife should not depart from her husband;
</br>11 but if she should actually depart, let her remain unmarried or else make up again with her husband; and a husband should not leave his wife.
<p></p>
</br>12 But to the others I say, yes, I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and yet she is agreeable to dwelling with him, let him not leave her;
</br>13 and a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and yet he is agreeable to dwelling with her, let her not leave her husband.
</br>14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to [his] wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, YOUR children would really be unclean, but now they are holy.
</br>15 But if the unbelieving one proceeds to depart, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not in servitude under such circumstances, but God has called YOU to peace.
</br>16 For, wife, how do you know but that you will save [your] husband? Or, husband, how do you know but that you will save [your] wife?
<p></p>
</br>17 Only, as Jehovah has given each one a portion, let each one so walk as God has called him. And thus I ordain in all the congregations.
</br>18 Was any man called circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has any man been called in uncircumcision? Let him not get circumcised.
</br>19 Circumcision does not mean a thing, and uncircumcision means not a thing, but observance of God’s commandments [does].
</br>20 In whatever state each one was called, let him remain in it.
</br>21 Were you called when a slave? Do not let it worry you; but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity.
</br>22 For anyone in [the] Lord that was called when a slave is the Lord’s freedman; likewise he that was called when a freeman is a slave of Christ.
</br>23 YOU were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men.
</br>24 In whatever condition each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it associated with God.
<p></p>
</br>25 Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who had mercy shown him by the Lord to be faithful.
</br>26 Therefore I think this to be well in view of the necessity here with us, that it is well for a man to continue as he is.
</br>27 Are you bound to a wife? Stop seeking a release. Are you loosed from a wife? Stop seeking a wife.
</br>28 But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin. And if a virgin [person] married, such one would commit no sin. However, those who do will have tribulation in their flesh. But I am sparing YOU.
<p></p>
</br>29 Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced. Henceforth let those who have wives be as though they had none,
</br>30 and also those who weep be as those who do not weep, and those who rejoice as those who do not rejoice, and those who buy as those not possessing,
</br>31 and those making use of the world as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing.
</br>32 Indeed, I want YOU to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may gain the Lord’s approval.
</br>33 But the married man is anxious for the things of the world, how he may gain the approval of his wife,
</br>34 and he is divided. Further, the unmarried woman, and the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit. However, the married woman is anxious for the things of the world, how she may gain the approval of her husband.
</br>35 But this I am saying for YOUR personal advantage, not that I may cast a noose upon YOU, but to move YOU to that which is becoming and that which means constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction.
<p></p>
</br>36 But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, if that is past the bloom of youth, and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.
</br>37 But if anyone stands settled in his heart, having no necessity, but has authority over his own will and has made this decision in his own heart, to keep his own virginity, he will do well.
</br>38 Consequently he also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better.
<p></p>
</br>39 A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep [in death], she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in [the] Lord.
</br>40 But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my opinion. I certainly think I also have God’s spirit.

</br>2 If anyone thinks he has acquired knowledge of something, he does not yet know [it] just as he ought to know [it].
</br>3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.
<p></p>
</br>4 Now concerning the eating of foods offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
</br>5 For even though there are those who are called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,”
</br>6 there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.
<p></p>
</br>7 Nevertheless, there is not this knowledge in all persons; but some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
</br>8 But food will not commend us to God; if we do not eat, we do not fall short, and, if we eat, we have no credit to ourselves.
</br>9 But keep watching that this authority of YOURS does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
</br>10 For if anyone should see you, the one having knowledge, reclining at a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be built up to the point of eating foods offered to idols?
</br>11 Really, by your knowledge, the man that is weak is being ruined, [your] brother for whose sake Christ died.
</br>12 But when YOU people thus sin against YOUR brothers and wound their conscience that is weak, YOU are sinning against Christ.

</br>3 My defense to those who examine me is as follows:
</br>4 We have authority to eat and drink, do we not?
</br>5 We have authority to lead about a sister as a wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Ce´phas, do we not?
</br>6 Or is it only Bar´na·bas and I that do not have authority to refrain from [secular] work?

<p></p>
</br>8 Am I speaking these things by human standards? Or does not the Law also say these things?
</br>9 For in the law of Moses it is written: “You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain.” Is it bulls God is caring for?
</br>10 Or is it altogether for our sakes he says it? Really for our sakes it was written, because the man who plows ought to plow in hope and the man who threshes ought to do so in hope of being a partaker.
<p></p>
</br>11 If we have sown spiritual things to YOU, is it something great if we shall reap things for the flesh from YOU?
</br>12 If other men partake of this authority over YOU, do we not much more so? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this authority, but we are bearing all things, in order that we might not offer any hindrance to the good news about the Christ.
</br>13 Do YOU not know that the men performing sacred duties eat the things of the temple, and those constantly attending at the altar have a portion for themselves with the altar?
</br>14 In this way, too, the Lord ordained for those proclaiming the good news to live by means of the good news.
<p></p>
</br>15 But I have not made use of a single one of these [provisions]. Indeed, I have not written these things that it should become so in my case, for it would be finer for me to die than—no man is going to make my reason for boasting void!
</br>16 If, now, I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast, for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!
</br>17 If I perform this willingly, I have a reward; but if I do it against my will, all the same I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
</br>18 What, then, is my reward? That while declaring the good news I may furnish the good news without cost, to the end that I may not abuse my authority in the good news.
<p></p>
</br>19 For, though I am free from all persons, I have made myself the slave to all, that I may gain the most persons.
</br>20 And so to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those under law I became as under law, though I myself am not under law, that I might gain those under law.
</br>21 To those without law I became as without law, although I am not without law toward God but under law toward Christ, that I might gain those without law.
</br>22 To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.
</br>23 But I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with [others].
<p></p>
</br>24 Do YOU not know that the runners in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that YOU may attain it.
</br>25 Moreover, every man taking part in a contest exercises self-control in all things. Now they, of course, do it that they may get a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one.
</br>26 Therefore, the way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air;
</br>27 but I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.

</br>2 and all got baptized into Moses by means of the cloud and of the sea;
</br>3 and all ate the same spiritual food
</br>4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they used to drink from the spiritual rock-mass that followed them, and that rock-mass meant the Christ.
</br>5 Nevertheless, on most of them God did not express his approval, for they were laid low in the wilderness.
<p></p>
</br>6 Now these things became our examples, for us not to be persons desiring injurious things, even as they desired them.
</br>7 Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; just as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they got up to have a good time.”
</br>8 Neither let us practice fornication, as some of them committed fornication, only to fall, twenty-three thousand [of them] in one day.
</br>9 Neither let us put Jehovah to the test, as some of them put [him] to the test, only to perish by the serpents.
</br>10 Neither be murmurers, just as some of them murmured, only to perish by the destroyer.
</br>11 Now these things went on befalling them as examples, and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived.
<p></p>
</br>12 Consequently let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.
</br>13 No temptation has taken YOU except what is common to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let YOU be tempted beyond what YOU can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for YOU to be able to endure it.
<p></p>
</br>14 Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.
</br>15 I speak as to men with discernment; judge for yourselves what I say.
</br>16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ? The loaf which we break, is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ?
</br>17 Because there is one loaf, we, although many, are one body, for we are all partaking of that one loaf.
<p></p>
</br>18 LOOK at that which is Israel in a fleshly way: Are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with the altar?
</br>19 What, then, am I to say? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?
</br>20 No; but I say that the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I do not want YOU to become sharers with the demons.
</br>21 YOU cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; YOU cannot be partaking of “the table of Jehovah” and the table of demons.
</br>22 Or “are we inciting Jehovah to jealousy”? We are not stronger than he is, are we?
<p></p>
</br>23 All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful; but not all things build up.
</br>24 Let each one keep seeking, not his own [advantage], but that of the other person.
<p></p>
</br>25 Everything that is sold in a meat market keep eating, making no inquiry on account of YOUR conscience;
</br>26 for “to Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it.”
</br>27 If anyone of the unbelievers invites YOU and YOU wish to go, proceed to eat everything that is set before YOU, making no inquiry on account of YOUR conscience.
</br>28 But if anyone should say to YOU: “This is something offered in sacrifice,” do not eat on account of the one that disclosed it and on account of conscience.
</br>29 “Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other person. For why should it be that my freedom is judged by another person’s conscience?
</br>30 If I am partaking with thanks, why am I to be spoken of abusively over that for which I give thanks?
<p></p>
</br>31 Therefore, whether YOU are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.
</br>32 Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God,
</br>33 even as I am pleasing all people in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, in order that they might get saved.

</br>1 Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.
<p></p>
</br>2 Now I commend YOU because in all things YOU have me in mind and YOU are holding fast the traditions just as I handed [them] on to YOU.
</br>3 But I want YOU to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.
</br>4 Every man that prays or prophesies having something on his head shames his head;
</br>5 but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a [woman] with a shaved head.
</br>6 For if a woman does not cover herself, let her also be shorn; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
<p></p>
</br>7 For a man ought not to have his head covered, as he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is man’s glory.
</br>8 For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;
</br>9 and, what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.
</br>10 That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.
<p></p>
</br>11 Besides, in connection with [the] Lord neither is woman without man nor man without woman.
</br>12 For just as the woman is out of the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are out of God.
</br>13 Judge for YOUR own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?
</br>14 Does not nature itself teach YOU that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him;
</br>15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? Because her hair is given her instead of a headdress.
</br>16 However, if any man seems to dispute for some other custom, we have no other, neither do the congregations of God.
<p></p>
</br>17 But, while giving these instructions, I do not commend YOU because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that YOU meet together.
</br>18 For first of all, when YOU come together in a congregation, I hear divisions exist among YOU; and in some measure I believe it.
</br>19 For there must also be sects among YOU, that the persons approved may also become manifest among YOU.
<p></p>
</br>20 Therefore, when YOU come together to one place, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s evening meal.
</br>21 For, when YOU eat [it], each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated.
</br>22 Certainly YOU do have houses for eating and drinking, do YOU not? Or do YOU despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing ashamed? What shall I say to YOU? Shall I commend YOU? In this I do not commend YOU.
<p></p>
</br>23 For I received from the Lord that which I also handed on to YOU, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf
</br>24 and, after giving thanks, he broke it and said: “This means my body which is in YOUR behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
</br>25 He did likewise respecting the cup also, after he had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood. Keep doing this, as often as YOU drink it, in remembrance of me.”
</br>26 For as often as YOU eat this loaf and drink this cup, YOU keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.
<p></p>
</br>27 Consequently whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord.
</br>28 First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and thus let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup.
</br>29 For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment against himself if he does not discern the body.
</br>30 That is why many among YOU are weak and sickly, and quite a few are sleeping [in death].
</br>31 But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged.
</br>32 However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, that we may not become condemned with the world.
</br>33 Consequently, my brothers, when YOU come together to eat [it], wait for one another.
</br>34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that YOU may not come together for judgment. But the remaining matters I will set in order when I get there.

</br>1 Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want YOU to be ignorant.
</br>2 YOU know that when YOU were people of the nations, YOU were being led away to those voiceless idols just as YOU happened to be led.
</br>3 Therefore I would have YOU know that nobody when speaking by God’s spirit says: “Jesus is accursed!” and nobody can say: “Jesus is Lord!” except by holy spirit.
<p></p>
</br>4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but there is the same spirit;
</br>5 and there are varieties of ministries, and yet there is the same Lord;
</br>6 and there are varieties of operations, and yet it is the same God who performs all the operations in all persons.
</br>7 But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose.
</br>8 For example, to one there is given through the spirit speech of wisdom, to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit,
</br>9 to another faith by the same spirit, to another gifts of healings by that one spirit,
</br>10 to yet another operations of powerful works, to another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired utterances, to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.
</br>11 But all these operations the one and the same spirit performs, making a distribution to each one respectively just as it wills.
<p></p>
</br>12 For just as the body is one but has many members, and all the members of that body, although being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
</br>13 For truly by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink one spirit.
<p></p>
</br>14 For the body, indeed, is not one member, but many.
</br>15 If the foot should say: “Because I am not a hand, I am no part of the body,” it is not for this reason no part of the body.
</br>16 And if the ear should say: “Because I am not an eye, I am no part of the body,” it is not for this reason no part of the body.
</br>17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the [sense of] hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the smelling be?
</br>18 But now God has set the members in the body, each one of them, just as he pleased.
<p></p>
</br>19 If they were all one member, where would the body be?
</br>20 But now they are many members, yet one body.
</br>21 The eye cannot say to the hand: “I have no need of you”; or, again, the head [cannot say] to the feet: “I have no need of YOU.”
</br>22 But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary,
</br>23 and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we surround with more abundant honor, and so our unseemly parts have the more abundant comeliness,
</br>24 whereas our comely parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God compounded the body, giving honor more abundant to the part which had a lack,
</br>25 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have the same care for one another.
</br>26 And if one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.
<p></p>
</br>27 Now YOU are Christ’s body, and members individually.
</br>28 And God has set the respective ones in the congregation, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services, abilities to direct, different tongues.
</br>29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they?
</br>30 Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all are translators, are they?
</br>31 But keep zealously seeking the greater gifts. And yet I show YOU a surpassing way.

</br>1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding [piece of] brass or a clashing cymbal.
</br>2 And if I have the gift of prophesying and am acquainted with all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
</br>3 And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body, that I may boast, but do not have love, I am not profited at all.
<p></p>
</br>4 Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up,
</br>5 does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.
</br>6 It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.
</br>7 It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
<p></p>
</br>8 Love never fails. But whether there are [gifts of] prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with.
</br>9 For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially;
</br>10 but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with.
</br>11 When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the [traits] of a babe.
</br>12 For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known.
</br>13 Now, however, there remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

<p></p>
</br>1 Pursue love, yet keep zealously seeking the spiritual gifts, but preferably that YOU may prophesy.
</br>2 For he that speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for no one listens, but he speaks sacred secrets by the spirit.
</br>3 However, he that prophesies upbuilds and encourages and consoles men by his speech.
</br>4 He that speaks in a tongue upbuilds himself, but he that prophesies upbuilds a congregation.
</br>5 Now I would like for all of YOU to speak in tongues, but I prefer that YOU prophesy. Indeed, he that prophesies is greater than he that speaks in tongues, unless, in fact, he translates, that the congregation may receive upbuilding.
</br>6 But at this time, brothers, if I should come speaking to YOU in tongues, what good would I do YOU unless I spoke to YOU either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?
<p></p>
</br>7 As it is, the inanimate things give off sound, whether a flute or a harp; unless it makes an interval to the tones, how will it be known what is being played on the flute or on the harp?
</br>8 For truly, if the trumpet sounds an indistinct call, who will get ready for battle?
</br>9 In the same way also, unless YOU through the tongue utter speech easily understood, how will it be known what is being spoken? YOU will, in fact, be speaking into the air.
</br>10 It may be that there are so many kinds of speech sounds in the world, and yet no [kind] is without meaning.
</br>11 If, then, I do not understand the force of the speech sound, I shall be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.
</br>12 So also YOU yourselves, since YOU are zealously desirous of [gifts of the] spirit, seek to abound in them for the upbuilding of the congregation.
<p></p>
</br>13 Therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may translate.
</br>14 For if I am praying in a tongue, it is my [gift of the] spirit that is praying, but my mind is unfruitful.
</br>15 What is to be done, then? I will pray with the [gift of the] spirit, but I will also pray with [my] mind. I will sing praise with the [gift of the] spirit, but I will also sing praise with [my] mind.
</br>16 Otherwise, if you offer praise with a [gift of the] spirit, how will the man occupying the seat of the ordinary person say “Amen” to your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
</br>17 True, you give thanks in a fine way, but the other man is not being built up.
</br>18 I thank God, I speak in more tongues than all of YOU do.
</br>19 Nevertheless, in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might also instruct others orally, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
<p></p>
</br>20 Brothers, do not become young children in powers of understanding, but be babes as to badness; yet become full-grown in powers of understanding.
</br>21 In the Law it is written: “‘With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and yet not even then will they give heed to me,’ says Jehovah.”
</br>22 Consequently tongues are for a sign, not to the believers, but to the unbelievers, whereas prophesying is, not for the unbelievers, but for the believers.
</br>23 Therefore, if the whole congregation comes together to one place and they all speak in tongues, but ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that YOU are mad?
</br>24 But if YOU are all prophesying and any unbeliever or ordinary person comes in, he is reproved by them all, he is closely examined by all;
</br>25 the secrets of his heart become manifest, so that he will fall upon [his] face and worship God, declaring: “God is really among YOU.”
<p></p>
</br>26 What is to be done, then, brothers? When YOU come together, one has a psalm, another has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a tongue, another has an interpretation. Let all things take place for upbuilding.
</br>27 And if someone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or three at the most, and in turns; and let someone translate.
</br>28 But if there be no translator, let him keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.
</br>29 Further, let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern the meaning.
</br>30 But if there is a revelation to another one while sitting there, let the first one keep silent.
</br>31 For YOU can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.
</br>32 And [gifts of] the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets.
</br>33 For God is [a God], not of disorder, but of peace.
<p></p>
As in all the congregations of the holy ones,
</br>34 let the women keep silent in the congregations, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but let them be in subjection, even as the Law says.
</br>35 If, then, they want to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in a congregation.
<p></p>
</br>36 What? Was it from YOU that the word of God came forth, or was it only as far as YOU that it reached?
<p></p>
</br>37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or gifted with the spirit, let him acknowledge the things I am writing to YOU, because they are the Lord’s commandment.
</br>38 But if anyone is ignorant, he continues ignorant.
</br>39 Consequently, my brothers, keep zealously seeking the prophesying, and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues.
</br>40 But let all things take place decently and by arrangement.

</br>1 Now I make known to YOU, brothers, the good news which I declared to YOU, which YOU also received, in which YOU also stand,
</br>2 through which YOU are also being saved, with the speech with which I declared the good news to YOU, if YOU are holding it fast, unless, in fact, YOU became believers to no purpose.
<p></p>
</br>3 For I handed on to YOU, among the first things, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;
</br>4 and that he was buried, yes, that he has been raised up the third day according to the Scriptures;
</br>5 and that he appeared to Ce´phas, then to the twelve.
</br>6 After that he appeared to upward of five hundred brothers at one time, the most of whom remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep [in death].
</br>7 After that he appeared to James, then to all the apostles;
</br>8 but last of all he appeared also to me as if to one born prematurely.
<p></p>
</br>9 For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of God.
</br>10 But by God’s undeserved kindness I am what I am. And his undeserved kindness that was toward me did not prove to be in vain, but I labored in excess of them all, yet not I but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me.
</br>11 However, whether it is I or they, so we are preaching and so YOU have believed.
<p></p>
</br>12 Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead, how is it some among YOU say there is no resurrection of the dead?
</br>13 If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised up.
</br>14 But if Christ has not been raised up, our preaching is certainly in vain, and our faith is in vain.
</br>15 Moreover, we are also found false witnesses of God, because we have borne witness against God that he raised up the Christ, but whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up.
</br>16 For if the dead are not to be raised up, neither has Christ been raised up.
</br>17 Further, if Christ has not been raised up, YOUR faith is useless; YOU are yet in YOUR sins.
</br>18 In fact, also, those who fell asleep [in death] in union with Christ perished.
</br>19 If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.
<p></p>
</br>20 However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death].
</br>21 For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a man.
</br>22 For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.
</br>23 But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.
</br>24 Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power.
</br>25 For he must rule as king until [God] has put all enemies under his feet.
</br>26 As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.
</br>27 For [God] “subjected all things under his feet.” But when he says that ‘all things have been subjected,’ it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him.
</br>28 But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.
<p></p>
</br>29 Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of [being] dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of [being] such?
</br>30 Why are we also in peril every hour?
</br>31 Daily I face death. This I affirm by the exultation over YOU, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</br>32 If, like men, I have fought with wild beasts at Eph´e·sus, of what good is it to me? If the dead are not to be raised up, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.”
</br>33 Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.
</br>34 Wake up to soberness in a righteous way and do not practice sin, for some are without knowledge of God. I am speaking to move YOU to shame.
<p></p>
</br>35 Nevertheless, someone will say: “How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what sort of body are they coming?”
</br>36 You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies;
</br>37 and as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat or any one of the rest;
</br>38 but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and to each of the seeds its own body.
</br>39 Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.
</br>40 And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort.
</br>41 The glory of the sun is one sort, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another; in fact, star differs from star in glory.
<p></p>
</br>42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption.
</br>43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised up in power.
</br>44 It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one.
</br>45 It is even so written: “The first man Adam became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
</br>46 Nevertheless, the first is, not that which is spiritual, but that which is physical, afterward that which is spiritual.
</br>47 The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven.
</br>48 As the one made of dust [is], so those made of dust [are] also; and as the heavenly one [is], so those who are heavenly [are] also.
</br>49 And just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one.
<p></p>
</br>50 However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
</br>51 Look! I tell YOU a sacred secret: We shall not all fall asleep [in death], but we shall all be changed,
</br>52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
</br>53 For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality.
</br>54 But when [this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and] this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: “Death is swallowed up forever.”
</br>55 “Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?”
</br>56 The sting producing death is sin, but the power for sin is the Law.
</br>57 But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
<p></p>
</br>58 Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that YOUR labor is not in vain in connection with [the] Lord.

</br>18 For they have refreshed my spirit and YOURS. Therefore recognize men of that sort.
<p></p>
</br>19 The congregations of Asia send YOU their greetings. Aq´ui·la and Pris´ca together with the congregation that is in their house greet YOU heartily in [the] Lord.
</br>20 All the brothers greet YOU. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
<p></p>
</br>21 [Here is] my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand.
<p></p>
</br>22 If anyone has no affection for the Lord, let him be accursed. O our Lord, come!
</br>23 May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with YOU.
</br>24 May my love be with all of YOU in union with Christ Jesus.
