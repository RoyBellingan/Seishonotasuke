</br>1 Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the accurate knowledge of the truth which accords with godly devotion
</br>2 upon the basis of a hope of the everlasting life which God, who cannot lie, promised before times long lasting,
</br>3 whereas in his own due times he made his word manifest in the preaching with which I was entrusted, under command of our Savior, God;
</br>4 to Titus, a genuine child according to a faith shared in common:
<p></p>
May there be undeserved kindness and peace from God [the] Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
<p></p>
</br>5 For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might correct the things that were defective and might make appointments of older men in city after city, as I gave you orders;
</br>6 if there is any man free from accusation, a husband of one wife, having believing children that were not under a charge of debauchery nor unruly.
</br>7 For an overseer must be free from accusation as God’s steward, not self-willed, not prone to wrath, not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, not greedy of dishonest gain,
</br>8 but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sound in mind, righteous, loyal, self-controlled,
</br>9 holding firmly to the faithful word as respects his [art of] teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the teaching that is healthful and to reprove those who contradict.
<p></p>
</br>10 For there are many unruly men, profitless talkers, and deceivers of the mind, especially those men who adhere to the circumcision.
</br>11 It is necessary to shut the mouths of these, as these very men keep on subverting entire households by teaching things they ought not for the sake of dishonest gain.
</br>12 A certain one of them, their own prophet, said: “Cre´tans are always liars, injurious wild beasts, unemployed gluttons.”
<p></p>
</br>13 This witness is true. For this very cause keep on reproving them with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith,
</br>14 paying no attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn themselves away from the truth.
</br>15 All things are clean to clean [persons]. But to [persons] defiled and faithless nothing is clean, but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
</br>16 They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works, because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort.

</br>1 You, however, keep on speaking what things are fitting for healthful teaching.
</br>2 Let the aged men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance.
</br>3 Likewise let the aged women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, neither enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good;
</br>4 that they may recall the young women to their senses to love their husbands, to love their children,
</br>5 to be sound in mind, chaste, workers at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.
<p></p>
</br>6 Likewise keep on exhorting the younger men to be sound in mind,
</br>7 in all things showing yourself an example of fine works; showing uncorruptness in your teaching, seriousness,
</br>8 wholesome speech which cannot be condemned; so that the man on the opposing side may get ashamed, having nothing vile to say about us.
</br>9 Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things, and please them well, not talking back,
</br>10 not committing theft, but exhibiting good fidelity to the full, so that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.
<p></p>
</br>11 For the undeserved kindness of God which brings salvation to all sorts of men has been manifested,
</br>12 instructing us to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things,
</br>13 while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of [the] Savior of us, Christ Jesus,
</br>14 who gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works.
<p></p>
</br>15 Keep on speaking these things and exhorting and reproving with full authority to command. Let no man ever despise you.

</br>1 Continue reminding them to be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities as rulers, to be ready for every good work,
</br>2 to speak injuriously of no one, not to be belligerent, to be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men.
</br>3 For even we were once senseless, disobedient, being misled, being slaves to various desires and pleasures, carrying on in badness and envy, abhorrent, hating one another.
<p></p>
</br>4 However, when the kindness and the love for man on the part of our Savior, God, was manifested,
</br>5 owing to no works in righteousness that we had performed, but according to his mercy he saved us through the bath that brought us to life and through the making of us new by holy spirit.
</br>6 This [spirit] he poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior,
</br>7 that, after being declared righteous by virtue of the undeserved kindness of that one, we might become heirs according to a hope of everlasting life.
<p></p>
</br>8 Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire you to make firm assertions constantly, in order that those who have believed God may keep their minds on maintaining fine works. These things are fine and beneficial to men.
<p></p>
</br>9 But shun foolish questionings and genealogies and strife and fights over the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile.
</br>10 As for a man that promotes a sect, reject him after a first and a second admonition;
</br>11 knowing that such a man has been turned out of the way and is sinning, he being self-condemned.
<p></p>
</br>12 When I send Ar´te·mas or Tych´i·cus to you, do your utmost to come to me at Ni·cop´o·lis, for there is where I have decided to winter.
</br>13 Carefully supply Ze´nas, who is versed in the Law, and A·pol´los for their trip, that they may not lack anything.
</br>14 But let our people also learn to maintain fine works so as to meet their pressing needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
<p></p>
</br>15 All those with me send you their greetings. Give my greetings to those who have affection for us in the faith.
<p></p>
May the undeserved kindness be with all of YOU people.
