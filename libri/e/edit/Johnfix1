</br>1 In [the] beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.
</br>2 This one was in [the] beginning with God.
</br>3 All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.
<p></p>
What has come into existence
</br>4 by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.
</br>5 And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.
<p></p>
</br>6 There arose a man that was sent forth as a representative of God: his name was John.
</br>7 This [man] came for a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, that people of all sorts might believe through him.
</br>8 He was not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.
<p></p>
</br>9 The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.
</br>10 He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him.
</br>11 He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in.
</br>12 However, as many as did receive him, to them he gave authority to become God’s children, because they were exercising faith in his name;
</br>13 and they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.
<p></p>
</br>14 So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of undeserved kindness and truth.
</br>15 (John bore witness about him, yes, he actually cried out—this was the one who said [it]—saying: “The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.”)
</br>16 For we all received from out of his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.
</br>17 Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.
</br>18 No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom [position] with the Father is the one that has explained him.
<p></p>
</br>19 Now this is the witness of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him to ask him: “Who are you?”
</br>20 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed: “I am not the Christ.”
</br>21 And they asked him: “What, then? Are you E·li´jah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you The Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”
</br>22 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
</br>23 He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘MAKE the way of Jehovah straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”
</br>24 Now those sent forth were from the Pharisees.
</br>25 So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you yourself are not the Christ or E·li´jah or The Prophet?”
</br>26 John answered them, saying: “I baptize in water. In the midst of YOU one is standing whom YOU do not know,
</br>27 the one coming behind me, but the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
</br>28 These things took place in Beth´a·ny across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<p></p>
</br>29 The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!
</br>30 This is the one about whom I said, Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.
</br>31 Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was that he might be made manifest to Israel.”
</br>32 John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.
</br>33 Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.’
</br>34 And I have seen [it], and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.”
<p></p>
</br>35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
</br>36 and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: “See, the Lamb of God!”
</br>37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
</br>38 Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: “What are YOU looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?”
</br>39 He said to them: “Come, and YOU will see.” Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour.
</br>40 Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed [Jesus].
</br>41 First this one found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Mes·si´ah” (which means, when translated, Christ).
</br>42 He led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked upon him he said: “You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Ce´phas” (which is translated Peter).
<p></p>
</br>43 The next day he desired to depart for Gal´i·lee. So Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Be my follower.”
</br>44 Now Philip was from Beth·sa´i·da, from the city of Andrew and Peter.
</br>45 Philip found Na·than´a·el and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Naz´a·reth.”
</br>46 But Na·than´a·el said to him: “Can anything good come out of Naz´a·reth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.”
</br>47 Jesus saw Na·than´a·el coming toward him and said about him: “See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.”
</br>48 Na·than´a·el said to him: “How does it come that you know me?” Jesus in answer said to him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
</br>49 Na·than´a·el answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.”
</br>50 Jesus in answer said to him: “Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe? You will see things greater than these.”
</br>51 He further said to him: “Most truly I say to YOU men, YOU will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”

</br>1 Now on the third day a marriage feast took place in Ca´na of Gal´i·lee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
</br>2 Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.
<p></p>
</br>3 When the wine ran short the mother of Jesus said to him: “They have no wine.”
</br>4 But Jesus said to her: “What have I to do with you, woman? My hour has not yet come.”
</br>5 His mother said to those ministering: “Whatever he tells YOU, do.”
</br>6 As it was, there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures.
</br>7 Jesus said to them: “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.
</br>8 And he said to them: “Draw some out now and take it to the director of the feast.” So they took it.
</br>9 When, now, the director of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine but did not know what its source was, although those ministering who had drawn out the water knew, the director of the feast called the bridegroom
</br>10 and said to him: “Every other man puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have reserved the fine wine until now.”
</br>11 Jesus performed this in Ca´na of Gal´i·lee as [the] beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him.
<p></p>
</br>12 After this he and his mother and brothers and his disciples went down to Ca·per´na·um, but they did not stay there many days.
<p></p>
</br>13 Now the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</br>14 And he found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats.
</br>15 So, after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
</br>16 And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise!”
</br>17 His disciples called to mind that it is written: “The zeal for your house will eat me up.”
<p></p>
</br>18 Therefore, in answer, the Jews said to him: “What sign have you to show us, since you are doing these things?”
</br>19 In answer Jesus said to them: “Break down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
</br>20 Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built in forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”
</br>21 But he was talking about the temple of his body.
</br>22 When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples called to mind that he used to say this; and they believed the Scripture and the saying that Jesus said.
<p></p>
</br>23 However, when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at its festival, many people put their faith in his name, viewing his signs that he was performing.
</br>24 But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them because of his knowing them all
</br>25 and because he was in no need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.

</br>1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de´mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.
</br>2 This one came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you as a teacher have come from God; for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.”
</br>3 In answer Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
</br>4 Nic·o·de´mus said to him: “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?”
</br>5 Jesus answered: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
</br>6 What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.
</br>7 Do not marvel because I told you, YOU people must be born again.
</br>8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone that has been born from the spirit.”
<p></p>
</br>9 In answer Nic·o·de´mus said to him: “How can these things come about?”
</br>10 In answer Jesus said to him: “Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?
</br>11 Most truly I say to you, What we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness of, but YOU people do not receive the witness we give.
</br>12 If I have told YOU earthly things and yet YOU do not believe, how will YOU believe if I tell YOU heavenly things?
</br>13 Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.
</br>14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up,
</br>15 that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.
<p></p>
</br>16 “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.
</br>17 For God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.
</br>18 He that exercises faith in him is not to be judged. He that does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
</br>19 Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.
</br>20 For he that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved.
</br>21 But he that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.”
<p></p>
</br>22 After these things Jesus and his disciples went into Ju·de´an country, and there he spent some time with them and did baptizing.
</br>23 But John also was baptizing in Ae´non near Sa´lim, because there was a great quantity of water there, and people kept coming and being baptized;
</br>24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
<p></p>
</br>25 Therefore a dispute arose on the part of the disciples of John with a Jew concerning purification.
</br>26 So they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man that was with you across the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, see, this one is baptizing and all are going to him.”
</br>27 In answer John said: “A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven.
</br>28 YOU yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent forth in advance of that one.
</br>29 He that has the bride is the bridegroom. However, the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore this joy of mine has been made full.
</br>30 That one must go on increasing, but I must go on decreasing.”
<p></p>
</br>31 He that comes from above is over all others. He that is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth. He that comes from heaven is over all others.
</br>32 What he has seen and heard, of this he bears witness, but no man is accepting his witness.
</br>33 He that has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that God is true.
</br>34 For the one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God, for he does not give the spirit by measure.
</br>35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
</br>36 He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.

</br>1 When, now, the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
</br>2 although, indeed, Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—
</br>3 he left Ju·de´a and departed again for Gal´i·lee.
</br>4 But it was necessary for him to go through Sa·mar´i·a.
</br>5 Accordingly he came to a city of Sa·mar´i·a called Sy´char near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son.
</br>6 In fact, Jacob’s fountain was there. Now Jesus, tired out from the journey, was sitting at the fountain just as he was. The hour was about the sixth.
<p></p>
</br>7 A woman of Sa·mar´i·a came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”
</br>8 (For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy foodstuffs.)
</br>9 Therefore the Sa·mar´i·tan woman said to him: “How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink, when I am a Sa·mar´i·tan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Sa·mar´i·tans.)
</br>10 In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known the free gift of God and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
</br>11 She said to him: “Sir, you have not even a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, therefore, do you have this living water?
</br>12 You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who himself together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?”
</br>13 In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.
</br>14 Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”
</br>15 The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”
<p></p>
</br>16 He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come to this place.”
</br>17 In answer the woman said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You said well, ‘A husband I do not have.’
</br>18 For you have had five husbands, and the [man] you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”
</br>19 The woman said to him: “Sir, I perceive you are a prophet.
</br>20 Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain; but YOU people say that in Jerusalem is the place where persons ought to worship.”
</br>21 Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, The hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will YOU people worship the Father.
</br>22 YOU worship what YOU do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews.
</br>23 Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.
</br>24 God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”
</br>25 The woman said to him: “I know that Mes·si´ah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one arrives, he will declare all things to us openly.”
</br>26 Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking to you am he.”
<p></p>
</br>27 Now at this point his disciples arrived, and they began to wonder because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you talk with her?”
</br>28 The woman, therefore, left her water jar and went off into the city and told the men:
</br>29 “Come here, see a man that told me all the things I did. This is not perhaps the Christ, is it?”
</br>30 They went out of the city and began coming to him.
<p></p>
</br>31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.”
</br>32 But he said to them: “I have food to eat of which YOU do not know.”
</br>33 Therefore the disciples began saying to one another: “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”
</br>34 Jesus said to them: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.
</br>35 Do YOU not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to YOU: Lift up YOUR eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already
</br>36 the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
</br>37 In this respect, indeed, the saying is true, One is the sower and another the reaper.
</br>38 I dispatched YOU to reap what YOU have spent no labor on. Others have labored, and YOU have entered into the benefit of their labor.”
<p></p>
</br>39 Now many of the Sa·mar´i·tans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman who said in witness: “He told me all the things I did.”
</br>40 Therefore when the Sa·mar´i·tans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.
</br>41 Consequently many more believed on account of what he said,
</br>42 and they began to say to the woman: “We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.”
<p></p>
</br>43 After the two days he left there for Gal´i·lee.
</br>44 Jesus himself, however, bore witness that in his own homeland a prophet has no honor.
</br>45 When, therefore, he arrived in Gal´i·lee, the Gal·i·le´ans received him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they also had gone to the festival.
<p></p>
</br>46 Accordingly he came again to Ca´na of Gal´i·lee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a certain attendant of the king whose son was sick in Ca·per´na·um.
</br>47 When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju·de´a into Gal´i·lee, he went off to him and began asking him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.
</br>48 However, Jesus said to him: “Unless YOU people see signs and wonders, YOU will by no means believe.”
</br>49 The attendant of the king said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”
</br>50 Jesus said to him: “Go your way; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.
</br>51 But already while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was living.
</br>52 Therefore he began to inquire of them the hour in which he got better in health. Accordingly they said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
</br>53 Therefore the father knew it was in the very hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son lives.” And he and his whole household believed.
</br>54 Again this was the second sign Jesus performed when he came out of Ju·de´a into Gal´i·lee.

</br>1 After these things there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</br>2 Now in Jerusalem at the sheepgate there is a pool designated in Hebrew Beth·za´tha, with five colonnades.
</br>3 In these a multitude of the sick, blind, lame and those with withered members, was lying down.
</br>4 ——
</br>5 But a certain man was there who had been in his sickness for thirty-eight years.
</br>6 Seeing this man lying down, and being aware that he had already been [sick] a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want to become sound in health?”
</br>7 The sick man answered him: “Sir, I do not have a man to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; but while I am coming another steps down ahead of me.”
</br>8 Jesus said to him: “Get up, pick up your cot and walk.”
</br>9 With that the man immediately became sound in health, and he picked up his cot and began to walk.
<p></p>
Now on that day it was a sabbath.
</br>10 Therefore the Jews began to say to the cured man: “It is Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry the cot.”
</br>11 But he answered them: “The very one that made me sound in health said to me, ‘Pick up your cot and walk.’”
</br>12 They asked him: “Who is the man that told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”
</br>13 But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had turned aside, there being a crowd in the place.
<p></p>
</br>14 After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you have become sound in health. Do not sin anymore, in order that something worse does not happen to you.”
</br>15 The man went away and told the Jews it was Jesus that made him sound in health.
</br>16 So on this account the Jews went persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during Sabbath.
</br>17 But he answered them: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.”
</br>18 On this account, indeed, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
<p></p>
</br>19 Therefore, in answer, Jesus went on to say to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he beholds the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
</br>20 For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, in order that YOU may marvel.
</br>21 For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to.
</br>22 For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son,
</br>23 in order that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He that does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
</br>24 Most truly I say to YOU, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.
<p></p>
</br>25 “Most truly I say to YOU, The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live.
</br>26 For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.
</br>27 And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is.
</br>28 Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice
</br>29 and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.
</br>30 I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; just as I hear, I judge; and the judgment that I render is righteous, because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
<p></p>
</br>31 “If I alone bear witness about myself, my witness is not true.
</br>32 There is another that bears witness about me, and I know that the witness which he bears about me is true.
</br>33 YOU have dispatched men to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
</br>34 However, I do not accept the witness from man, but I say these things that YOU may be saved.
</br>35 That man was a burning and shining lamp, and YOU for a short time were willing to rejoice greatly in his light.
</br>36 But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, the works themselves that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father dispatched me.
</br>37 Also, the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. YOU have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure;
</br>38 and YOU do not have his word remaining in YOU, because the very one whom he dispatched YOU do not believe.
<p></p>
</br>39 “YOU are searching the Scriptures, because YOU think that by means of them YOU will have everlasting life; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me.
</br>40 And yet YOU do not want to come to me that YOU may have life.
</br>41 I do not accept glory from men,
</br>42 but I well know that YOU do not have the love of God in YOU.
</br>43 I have come in the name of my Father, but YOU do not receive me; if someone else arrived in his own name, YOU would receive that one.
</br>44 How can YOU believe, when YOU are accepting glory from one another and YOU are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?
</br>45 Do not think that I will accuse YOU to the Father; there is one that accuses YOU, Moses, in whom YOU have put YOUR hope.
</br>46 In fact, if YOU believed Moses YOU would believe me, for that one wrote about me.
</br>47 But if YOU do not believe the writings of that one, how will YOU believe my sayings?”

</br>1 After these things Jesus departed across the sea of Gal´i·lee, or Ti·be´ri·as.
</br>2 But a great crowd kept following him, because they were beholding the signs he was performing upon those who were ill.
</br>3 So Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he was sitting with his disciples.
</br>4 Now the passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.
</br>5 When, therefore, Jesus raised his eyes and observed that a great crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where shall we buy loaves for these to eat?”
</br>6 However, he was saying this to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
</br>7 Philip answered him: “Two hundred de·nar´i·i worth of loaves is not enough for them, so that each one may get a little.”
</br>8 One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
</br>9 “Here is a little boy that has five barley loaves and two small fishes. But what are these among so many?”
<p></p>
</br>10 Jesus said: “HAVE the men recline as at meal.” Now there was a lot of grass in the place. Therefore the men reclined, about five thousand in number.
</br>11 So Jesus took the loaves and, after giving thanks, he distributed them to those reclining, likewise also as much of the small fishes as they wanted.
</br>12 But when they had their fill he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments that remain over, so that nothing is wasted.”
</br>13 Therefore they gathered them together, and they filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
<p></p>
</br>14 Hence when the men saw the signs he performed, they began to say: “This is for a certainty the prophet that was to come into the world.”
</br>15 Therefore Jesus, knowing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone.

</br>16 When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,
</br>17 and, boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Ca·per´na·um. Well, by now it had grown dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.
</br>18 Also, the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
</br>19 However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they beheld Jesus walking upon the sea and getting near the boat; and they became fearful.
</br>20 But he said to them: “It is I; have no fear!”
</br>21 Therefore they were willing to take him into the boat, and directly the boat was at the land to which they were trying to go.
<p></p>
</br>22 The next day the crowd that was standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there except a little one, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples but that only his disciples had left;
</br>23 but boats from Ti·be´ri·as arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
</br>24 Therefore when the crowd saw that neither Jesus was there nor his disciples, they boarded their little boats and came to Ca·per´na·um to look for Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>25 So when they found him across the sea they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
</br>26 Jesus answered them and said: “Most truly I say to YOU, YOU are looking for me, not because YOU saw signs, but because YOU ate from the loaves and were satisfied.
</br>27 Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting, which the Son of man will give YOU; for upon this one the Father, even God, has put his seal [of approval].”
<p></p>
</br>28 Therefore they said to him: “What shall we do to work the works of God?”
</br>29 In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that YOU exercise faith in him whom that One sent forth.”
</br>30 Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you performing as a sign, in order for us to see [it] and believe you? What work are you doing?
</br>31 Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
</br>32 Hence Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Moses did not give YOU the bread from heaven, but my Father does give YOU the true bread from heaven.
</br>33 For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
</br>34 Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”
<p></p>
</br>35 Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. He that comes to me will not get hungry at all, and he that exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.
</br>36 But I have said to YOU, YOU have even seen me and yet do not believe.
</br>37 Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one that comes to me I will by no means drive away;
</br>38 because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.
</br>39 This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day.
</br>40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”
<p></p>
</br>41 Therefore the Jews began to murmur at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven”;
</br>42 and they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it that now he says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
</br>43 In answer Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.
</br>44 No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him; and I will resurrect him in the last day.
</br>45 It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me.
</br>46 Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God; this one has seen the Father.
</br>47 Most truly I say to YOU, He that believes has everlasting life.
<p></p>
</br>48 “I am the bread of life.
</br>49 YOUR forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet died.
</br>50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
</br>51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”
<p></p>
</br>52 Therefore the Jews began contending with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
</br>53 Accordingly Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Unless YOU eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, YOU have no life in yourselves.
</br>54 He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I shall resurrect him at the last day;
</br>55 for my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
</br>56 He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.
</br>57 Just as the living Father sent me forth and I live because of the Father, he also that feeds on me, even that one will live because of me.
</br>58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when YOUR forefathers ate and yet died. He that feeds on this bread will live forever.”
</br>59 These things he said as he was teaching in public assembly at Ca·per´na·um.
<p></p>
</br>60 Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”
</br>61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: “Does this stumble YOU?
</br>62 What, therefore, if YOU should behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?
</br>63 It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to YOU are spirit and are life.
</br>64 But there are some of YOU that do not believe.” For from [the] beginning Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.
</br>65 So he went on to say: “This is why I have said to YOU, No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”
<p></p>
</br>66 Owing to this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.
</br>67 Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “YOU do not want to go also, do YOU?”
</br>68 Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life;
</br>69 and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
</br>70 Jesus answered them: “I chose YOU twelve, did I not? Yet one of YOU is a slanderer.”
</br>71 He was, in fact, speaking of Judas [the son] of Simon Is·car´i·ot; for this one was going to betray him, although one of the twelve.

</br>1 Now after these things Jesus continued walking about in Gal´i·lee, for he did not want to walk about in Ju·de´a, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.
</br>2 However, the festival of the Jews, the festival of tabernacles, was near.
</br>3 Therefore his brothers said to him: “Pass on over from here and go into Ju·de´a, in order that your disciples also may behold the works you do.
</br>4 For nobody does anything in secret while himself seeking to be known publicly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.”
</br>5 His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him.
</br>6 Therefore Jesus said to them: “My due time is not yet present, but YOUR due time is always at hand.
</br>7 The world has no reason to hate YOU, but it hates me, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are wicked.
</br>8 YOU go up to the festival; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my due time has not yet fully come.”
</br>9 So after he told them these things, he remained in Gal´i·lee.
<p></p>
</br>10 But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up himself, not openly but as in secret.
</br>11 Therefore the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying: “Where is that [man]?”
</br>12 And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds. Some would say: “He is a good man.” Others would say: “He is not, but he misleads the crowd.”
</br>13 No one, of course, would speak about him publicly because of the fear of the Jews.
<p></p>
</br>14 When by now the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.
</br>15 Therefore the Jews fell to wondering, saying: “How does this man have a knowledge of letters, when he has not studied at the schools?”
</br>16 Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.
</br>17 If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.
</br>18 He that speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
</br>19 Moses gave YOU the Law, did he not? But not one of YOU obeys the Law. Why are YOU seeking to kill me?”
</br>20 The crowd answered: “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?”
</br>21 In answer Jesus said to them: “One deed I performed, and YOU are all wondering.
</br>22 For this reason Moses has given YOU the circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but that it is from the forefathers—and YOU circumcise a man on a sabbath.
</br>23 If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken, are YOU violently angry at me because I made a man completely sound in health on a sabbath?
</br>24 Stop judging from the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”
<p></p>
</br>25 Therefore some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say: “This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not?
</br>26 And yet, see! he is speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. The rulers have not come to know for a certainty that this is the Christ, have they?
</br>27 On the contrary, we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one is to know where he is from.”
</br>28 Therefore Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple and said: “YOU both know me and know where I am from. Also, I have not come of my own initiative, but he that sent me is real, and YOU do not know him.
</br>29 I know him, because I am a representative from him, and that One sent me forth.”
</br>30 Hence they began seeking to get hold of him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.
</br>31 Still, many of the crowd put faith in him; and they commenced saying: “When the Christ arrives, he will not perform more signs than this man has performed, will he?”
<p></p>
</br>32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees dispatched officers to get hold of him.
</br>33 Therefore Jesus said: “I continue a little while longer with YOU before I go to him that sent me.
</br>34 YOU will look for me, but YOU will not find me, and where I am YOU cannot come.”
</br>35 Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where does this [man] intend going, so that we shall not find him? He does not intend to go to the [Jews] dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he?
</br>36 What does this saying mean that he said, ‘YOU will look for me, but YOU will not find me, and where I am YOU cannot come’?”
<p></p>
</br>37 Now on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus was standing up and he cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
</br>38 He that puts faith in me, just as the Scripture has said, ‘Out from his inmost part streams of living water will flow.’”
</br>39 However, he said this concerning the spirit which those who put faith in him were about to receive; for as yet there was no spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
</br>40 Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words began saying: “This is for a certainty The Prophet.”
</br>41 Others were saying: “This is the Christ.” But some were saying: “The Christ is not actually coming out of Gal´i·lee, is he?
</br>42 Has not the Scripture said that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David, and from Beth´le·hem the village where David used to be?”
</br>43 Therefore a division over him developed among the crowd.
</br>44 Some of them, though, were wanting to get hold of him, but no one did lay [his] hands upon him.
<p></p>
</br>45 Therefore the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and the latter said to them: “Why is it YOU did not bring him in?”
</br>46 The officers replied: “Never has [another] man spoken like this.”
</br>47 In turn the Pharisees answered: “YOU have not been misled also, have YOU?
</br>48 Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he?
</br>49 But this crowd that does not know the Law are accursed people.”
</br>50 Nic·o·de´mus, who had come to him previously, and who was one of them, said to them:
</br>51 “Our law does not judge a man unless first it has heard from him and come to know what he is doing, does it?”
</br>52 In answer they said to him: “You are not also out of Gal´i·lee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Gal´i·lee.”*

<p></p>
</br>12 Therefore Jesus spoke again to them, saying: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.”
</br>13 Hence the Pharisees said to him: “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.”
</br>14 In answer Jesus said to them: “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But YOU do not know where I came from and where I am going.
</br>15 YOU judge according to the flesh; I do not judge any man at all.
</br>16 And yet if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.
</br>17 Also, in YOUR own Law it is written, ‘The witness of two men is true.’
</br>18 I am one that bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.”
</br>19 Therefore they went on to say to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “YOU know neither me nor my Father. If YOU did know me, YOU would know my Father also.”
</br>20 These sayings he spoke in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one laid hold of him, because his hour had not yet come.
<p></p>
</br>21 Hence he said to them again: “I am going away, and YOU will look for me, and yet YOU will die in YOUR sin. Where I am going YOU cannot come.”
</br>22 Therefore the Jews began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going YOU cannot come.’”
</br>23 So he went on to say to them: “YOU are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. YOU are from this world; I am not from this world.
</br>24 Therefore I said to YOU, YOU will die in YOUR sins. For if YOU do not believe that I am [he], YOU will die in YOUR sins.”
</br>25 Therefore they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “Why am I even speaking to YOU at all?
</br>26 I have many things to speak concerning YOU and to pass judgment upon. As a matter of fact, he that sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.”
</br>27 They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father.
</br>28 Therefore Jesus said: “When once YOU have lifted up the Son of man, then YOU will know that I am [he], and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things.
</br>29 And he that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”
</br>30 As he was speaking these things, many put faith in him.
<p></p>
</br>31 And so Jesus went on to say to the Jews that had believed him: “If YOU remain in my word, YOU are really my disciples,
</br>32 and YOU will know the truth, and the truth will set YOU free.”
</br>33 They replied to him: “We are Abraham’s offspring and never have we been slaves to anybody. How is it you say, ‘YOU will become free’?”
</br>34 Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Every doer of sin is a slave of sin.
</br>35 Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever.
</br>36 Therefore if the Son sets YOU free, YOU will be actually free.
</br>37 I know that YOU are Abraham’s offspring; but YOU are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among YOU.
</br>38 What things I have seen with my Father I speak; and YOU, therefore, do the things YOU have heard from [YOUR] father.”
</br>39 In answer they said to him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If YOU are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.
</br>40 But now YOU are seeking to kill me, a man that has told YOU the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
</br>41 YOU do the works of YOUR father.” They said to him: “We were not born from fornication; we have one Father, God.”
<p></p>
</br>42 Jesus said to them: “If God were YOUR Father, YOU would love me, for from God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth.
</br>43 Why is it YOU do not know what I am speaking? Because YOU cannot listen to my word.
</br>44 YOU are from YOUR father the Devil, and YOU wish to do the desires of YOUR father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of [the lie].
</br>45 Because I, on the other hand, tell the truth, YOU do not believe me.
</br>46 Who of YOU convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it YOU do not believe me?
</br>47 He that is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why YOU do not listen, because YOU are not from God.”
<p></p>
</br>48 In answer the Jews said to him: “Do we not rightly say, You are a Sa·mar´i·tan and have a demon?”
</br>49 Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and YOU dishonor me.
</br>50 But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One that is seeking and judging.
</br>51 Most truly I say to YOU, If anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.”
</br>52 The Jews said to him: “Now we do know you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets; but you say, ‘If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.’
</br>53 You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? Also, the prophets died. Who do you claim to be?”
</br>54 Jesus answered: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, he who YOU say is YOUR God;
</br>55 and yet YOU have not known him. But I know him. And if I said I do not know him I should be like YOU, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word.
</br>56 Abraham YOUR father rejoiced greatly in the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”
</br>57 Therefore the Jews said to him: “You are not yet fifty years old, and still you have seen Abraham?”
</br>58 Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, Before Abraham came into existence, I have been.”
</br>59 Therefore they picked up stones to hurl [them] at him; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple.

</br>1 Now as he was passing along he saw a man blind from birth.
</br>2 And his disciples asked him: “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?”
</br>3 Jesus answered: “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it was in order that the works of God might be made manifest in his case.
</br>4 We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no man can work.
</br>5 As long as I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”
</br>6 After he said these things, he spit on the ground and made a clay with the saliva, and put his clay upon the [man’s] eyes
</br>7 and said to him: “Go wash in the pool of Si·lo´am” (which is translated ‘Sent forth’). And so he went off and washed, and came back seeing.
<p></p>
</br>8 Therefore the neighbors and those who formerly used to see he was a beggar began to say: “This is the man that used to sit and beg, is it not?”
</br>9 Some would say: “This is he.” Others would say: “Not at all, but he is like him.” The man would say: “I am [he].”
</br>10 Consequently they began to say to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?”
</br>11 He answered: “The man called Jesus made a clay and smeared [it] on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Si·lo´am and wash.’ I therefore went and washed and gained sight.”
</br>12 At this they said to him: “Where is that [man]?” He said: “I do not know.”
<p></p>
</br>13 They led the once-blind man himself to the Pharisees.
</br>14 Incidentally it was Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
</br>15 This time, therefore, the Pharisees also took up asking him how he gained sight. He said to them: “He put a clay upon my eyes, and I washed and have sight.”
</br>16 Therefore some of the Pharisees began to say: “This is not a man from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.” Others began to say: “How can a man that is a sinner perform signs of that sort?” So there was a division among them.
</br>17 Hence they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, seeing that he opened your eyes?” The [man] said: “He is a prophet.”
<p></p>
</br>18 However, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had gained sight, until they called the parents of the man that gained sight.
</br>19 And they asked them: “Is this YOUR son who YOU say was born blind? How, then, is it he sees at present?”
</br>20 Then in answer his parents said: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
</br>21 But how it is he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. ASK him. He is of age. He must speak for himself.”
</br>22 His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews, for the Jews had already come to an agreement that, if anyone confessed him as Christ, he should get expelled from the synagogue.
</br>23 This is why his parents said: “He is of age. QUESTION him.”
<p></p>
</br>24 Therefore a second time they called the man that had been blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”
</br>25 In turn he answered: “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, I see at present.”
</br>26 Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
</br>27 He answered them: “I told YOU already, and yet YOU did not listen. Why do YOU want to hear it again? YOU do not want to become his disciples also, do YOU?”
</br>28 At this they reviled him and said: “You are a disciple of that [man], but we are disciples of Moses.
</br>29 We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this [man], we do not know where he is from.”
</br>30 In answer the man said to them: “This certainly is a marvel, that YOU do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
</br>31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to this one.
</br>32 From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.
</br>33 If this [man] were not from God, he could do nothing at all.”
</br>34 In answer they said to him: “You were altogether born in sins, and yet are you teaching us?” And they threw him out!
<p></p>
</br>35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and, on finding him, he said: “Are you putting faith in the Son of man?”
</br>36 The [man] answered: “And who is he, sir, that I may put faith in him?”
</br>37 Jesus said to him: “You have seen him and, besides, he that is speaking with you is that one.”
</br>38 Then he said: “I do put faith [in him], Lord.” And he did obeisance to him.
</br>39 And Jesus said: “For [this] judgment I came into this world: that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”
</br>40 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “We are not blind also, are we?”
</br>41 Jesus said to them: “If YOU were blind, YOU would have no sin. But now YOU say, ‘We see.’ YOUR sin remains.”

</br>5 A stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”
</br>6 Jesus spoke this comparison to them; but they did not know what the things meant that he was speaking to them.
<p></p>
</br>7 Therefore Jesus said again: “Most truly I say to YOU, I am the door of the sheep.
</br>8 All those that have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers; but the sheep have not listened to them.
</br>9 I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and find pasturage.
</br>10 The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance.
</br>11 I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.
</br>12 The hired man, who is no shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong as his own, beholds the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them—
</br>13 because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.
</br>14 I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me,
</br>15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep.
<p></p>
</br>16 “And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.
</br>17 This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my soul, in order that I may receive it again.
</br>18 No man has taken it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative. I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. The commandment on this I received from my Father.”
<p></p>
</br>19 Again a division resulted among the Jews because of these words.
</br>20 Many of them were saying: “He has a demon and is mad. Why do YOU listen to him?”
</br>21 Others would say: “These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people’s eyes, can it?”
<p></p>
</br>22 At that time the festival of dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime,
</br>23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Sol´o·mon.
</br>24 Therefore the Jews encircled him and began to say to him: “How long are you to keep our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us outspokenly.”
</br>25 Jesus answered them: “I told YOU, and yet YOU do not believe. The works that I am doing in the name of my Father, these bear witness about me.
</br>26 But YOU do not believe, because YOU are none of my sheep.
</br>27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
</br>28 And I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
</br>29 What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father.
</br>30 I and the Father are one.”
<p></p>
</br>31 Once more the Jews lifted up stones to stone him.
</br>32 Jesus replied to them: “I displayed to YOU many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are YOU stoning me?”
</br>33 The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy, even because you, although being a man, make yourself a god.”
</br>34 Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said: “YOU are gods”’?
</br>35 If he called ‘gods’ those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified,
</br>36 do YOU say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, I am God’s Son?
</br>37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
</br>38 But if I am doing them, even though YOU do not believe me, believe the works, in order that YOU may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.”
</br>39 Therefore they tried again to seize him; but he got out of their reach.
<p></p>
</br>40 So he went off again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.
</br>41 And many people came to him, and they began saying: “John, indeed, did not perform a single sign, but as many things as John said about this man were all true.”
</br>42 And many put faith in him there.

</br>1 Now there was a certain man sick, Laz´a·rus of Beth´a·ny, of the village of Mary and of Martha her sister.
</br>2 It was, in fact, the Mary that greased the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Laz´a·rus was sick.
</br>3 Therefore his sisters dispatched word to him, saying: “Lord, see! the one for whom you have affection is sick.”
</br>4 But when Jesus heard it he said: “This sickness is not with death as its object, but is for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
<p></p>
</br>5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Laz´a·rus.
</br>6 However, when he heard that he was sick, then he actually remained two days in the place where he was.
</br>7 Then after this he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Ju·de´a again.”
</br>8 The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, just lately the Ju·de´ans were seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”
</br>9 Jesus answered: “There are twelve hours of daylight, are there not? If anyone walks in daylight he does not bump against anything, because he sees the light of this world.
</br>10 But if anyone walks in the night, he bumps against something, because the light is not in him.”
<p></p>
</br>11 He said these things, and after this he said to them: “Laz´a·rus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there to awaken him from sleep.”
</br>12 Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has gone to rest, he will get well.”
</br>13 Jesus had spoken, however, about his death. But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
</br>14 At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: “Laz´a·rus has died,
</br>15 and I rejoice on YOUR account that I was not there, in order for YOU to believe. But let us go to him.”
</br>16 Therefore Thomas, who was called The Twin, said to his fellow disciples: “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”
<p></p>
</br>17 Consequently when Jesus arrived, he found he had already been four days in the memorial tomb.
</br>18 Now Beth´a·ny was near Jerusalem at a distance of about two miles.
</br>19 Accordingly many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.
</br>20 Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him; but Mary kept sitting at home.
</br>21 Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.
</br>22 And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.”
</br>23 Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”
</br>24 Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”
</br>25 Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life;
</br>26 and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?”
</br>27 She said to him: “Yes, Lord; I have believed that you are the Christ the Son of God, the One coming into the world.”
</br>28 And when she had said this, she went off and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is present and is calling you.”
</br>29 The latter, when she heard this, got up quickly and was on her way to him.
<p></p>
</br>30 Jesus had not yet, in fact, come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him.
</br>31 Therefore the Jews that were with her in the house and that were consoling her, on seeing Mary rise quickly and go out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the memorial tomb to weep there.
</br>32 And so Mary, when she arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him, fell at his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
</br>33 Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping and the Jews that came with her weeping, groaned in the spirit and became troubled;
</br>34 and he said: “Where have YOU laid him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.”
</br>35 Jesus gave way to tears.
</br>36 Therefore the Jews began to say: “See, what affection he used to have for him!”
</br>37 But some of them said: “Was not this [man] that opened the eyes of the blind man able to prevent this one from dying?”
<p></p>
</br>38 Hence Jesus, after groaning again within himself, came to the memorial tomb. It was, in fact, a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
</br>39 Jesus said: “TAKE the stone away.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: “Lord, by now he must smell, for it is four days.”
</br>40 Jesus said to her: “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?”
</br>41 Therefore they took the stone away. Now Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
</br>42 True, I knew that you always hear me; but on account of the crowd standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that you sent me forth.”
</br>43 And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: “Laz´a·rus, come on out!”
</br>44 The [man] that had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his countenance was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them: “Loose him and let him go.”
<p></p>
</br>45 Therefore many of the Jews that had come to Mary and that beheld what he did put faith in him;
</br>46 but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.
</br>47 Consequently the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the San´he·drin together and began to say: “What are we to do, because this man performs many signs?
</br>48 If we let him alone this way, they will all put faith in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
</br>49 But a certain one of them, Ca´ia·phas, who was high priest that year, said to them: “YOU do not know anything at all,
</br>50 and YOU do not reason out that it is to YOUR benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people and not for the whole nation to be destroyed.”
</br>51 This, though, he did not say of his own originality; but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was destined to die for the nation,
</br>52 and not for the nation only, but in order that the children of God who are scattered about he might also gather together in one.
</br>53 Therefore from that day on they took counsel to kill him.
<p></p>
</br>54 Hence Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews, but he departed from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called E´phra·im, and there he remained with the disciples.
</br>55 Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many people went up out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover in order to cleanse themselves ceremonially.
</br>56 Therefore they went looking for Jesus and they would say to one another as they stood around in the temple: “What is YOUR opinion? That he will not come to the festival at all?”
</br>57 As it was, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where he was, he should disclose [it], in order that they might seize him.

<p></p>
</br>1 Accordingly Jesus, six days before the passover, arrived at Beth´a·ny, where Laz´a·rus was whom Jesus had raised up from the dead.
</br>2 Therefore they spread an evening meal for him there, and Martha was ministering, but Laz´a·rus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
</br>3 Mary, therefore, took a pound of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very costly, and she greased the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair. The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil.
</br>4 But Judas Is·car´i·ot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said:
</br>5 “Why was it this perfumed oil was not sold for three hundred de·nar´i·i and given to the poor people?”
</br>6 He said this, though, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to carry off the monies put in it.
</br>7 Therefore Jesus said: “Let her alone, that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial.
</br>8 For YOU have the poor always with YOU, but me YOU will not have always.”
<p></p>
</br>9 Therefore a great crowd of the Jews got to know he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but also to see Laz´a·rus, whom he raised up from the dead.
</br>10 The chief priests now took counsel to kill Laz´a·rus also,
</br>11 because on account of him many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>12 The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival, on hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
</br>13 took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they began to shout: “Save, we pray you! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name, even the king of Israel!”
</br>14 But when Jesus had found a young ass, he sat on it, just as it is written:
</br>15 “Have no fear, daughter of Zion. Look! Your king is coming, seated upon an ass’s colt.”
</br>16 These things his disciples took no note of at first, but when Jesus became glorified, then they called to mind that these things were written respecting him and that they did these things to him.
<p></p>
</br>17 Accordingly the crowd that was with him when he called Laz´a·rus out of the memorial tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness.
</br>18 On this account the crowd, because they heard he had performed this sign, also met him.
</br>19 Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “YOU observe YOU are getting absolutely nowhere. See! The world has gone after him.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Now there were some Greeks among those that came up to worship at the festival.
</br>21 These, therefore, approached Philip who was from Beth·sa´i·da of Gal´i·lee, and they began to request him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
</br>22 Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>23 But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
</br>24 Most truly I say to YOU, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains just one [grain]; but if it dies, it then bears much fruit.
</br>25 He that is fond of his soul destroys it, but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.
</br>26 If anyone would minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am there my minister will be also. If anyone would minister to me, the Father will honor him.
</br>27 Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me out of this hour. Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour.
</br>28 Father, glorify your name.” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified [it] and will glorify [it] again.”
<p></p>
</br>29 Hence the crowd that stood about and heard it began to say that it had thundered. Others began to say: “An angel has spoken to him.”
</br>30 In answer Jesus said: “This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for YOUR sakes.
</br>31 Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
</br>32 And yet I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw men of all sorts to me.”
</br>33 This he was really saying to signify what sort of death he was about to die.
</br>34 Therefore the crowd answered him: “We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how is it you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?”
</br>35 Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among YOU a little while longer. Walk while YOU have the light, so that darkness does not overpower YOU; and he that walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
</br>36 While YOU have the light, exercise faith in the light, in order to become sons of light.”
<p></p>
Jesus spoke these things and went off and hid from them.
</br>37 But although he had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him,
</br>38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said: “Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard by us? And as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed?”
</br>39 The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said:
</br>40 “He has blinded their eyes and he has made their hearts hard, that they should not see with their eyes and get the thought with their hearts and turn around and I should heal them.”
</br>41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.
</br>42 All the same, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess [him], in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;
</br>43 for they loved the glory of men more than even the glory of God.
<p></p>
</br>44 However, Jesus cried out and said: “He that puts faith in me puts faith, not in me [only], but in him [also] that sent me;
</br>45 and he that beholds me beholds [also] him that sent me.
</br>46 I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.
</br>47 But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world.
</br>48 He that disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him. The word that I have spoken is what will judge him in the last day;
</br>49 because I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak.
</br>50 Also, I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore the things I speak, just as the Father has told me [them], so I speak [them].”

</br>1 Now, because he knew before the festival of the passover that his hour had come for him to move out of this world to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the end.
</br>2 So, while the evening meal was going on, the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Is·car´i·ot, the son of Simon, to betray him,
</br>3 he, knowing that the Father had given all things into [his] hands and that he came forth from God and was going to God,
</br>4 got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And, taking a towel, he girded himself.
</br>5 After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel with which he was girded.
</br>6 And so he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?”
</br>7 In answer Jesus said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand at present, but you will understand after these things.”
</br>8 Peter said to him: “You will certainly never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him: “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”
</br>9 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”
</br>10 Jesus said to him: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean. And YOU men are clean, but not all.”
</br>11 He knew, indeed, the man betraying him. This is why he said: “Not all of YOU are clean.”
<p></p>
</br>12 When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on and laid himself down at the table again, he said to them: “Do YOU know what I have done to YOU?
</br>13 YOU address me, ‘Teacher,’ and, ‘Lord,’ and YOU speak rightly, for I am such.
</br>14 Therefore, if I, although Lord and Teacher, washed YOUR feet, YOU also ought to wash the feet of one another.
</br>15 For I set the pattern for YOU, that, just as I did to YOU, YOU should do also.
</br>16 Most truly I say to YOU, A slave is not greater than his master, nor is one that is sent forth greater than the one that sent him.
</br>17 If YOU know these things, happy YOU are if YOU do them.
</br>18 I am not talking about all of YOU; I know the ones I have chosen. But it is in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’
</br>19 From this moment on I am telling YOU before it occurs, in order that when it does occur YOU may believe that I am [he].
</br>20 Most truly I say to YOU, He that receives anyone I send receives me [also]. In turn he that receives me, receives [also] him that sent me.”
<p></p>
</br>21 After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he bore witness and said: “Most truly I say to YOU, One of YOU will betray me.”
</br>22 The disciples began to look at one another, being at a loss as to which one he was saying [it] about.
</br>23 There was reclining in front of Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, and Jesus loved him.
</br>24 Therefore Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him: “Tell who it is about whom he is saying [it].”
</br>25 So the latter leaned back upon the breast of Jesus and said to him: “Lord, who is it?”
</br>26 Therefore Jesus answered: “It is that one to whom I shall give the morsel that I dip.” And so, having dipped the morsel, he took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Is·car´i·ot.
</br>27 And after the morsel then Satan entered into the latter. Jesus, therefore, said to him: “What you are doing get done more quickly.”
</br>28 However, none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose he said this to him.
</br>29 Some, in fact, were imagining, since Judas was holding the money box, that Jesus was telling him: “Buy what things we need for the festival,” or that he should give something to the poor.
</br>30 Therefore, after he received the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night.
<p></p>
</br>31 Hence when he had gone out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in connection with him.
</br>32 And God will himself glorify him, and he will glorify him immediately.
</br>33 Little children, I am with YOU a little longer. YOU will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go YOU cannot come,’ I say also to YOU at present.
</br>34 I am giving YOU a new commandment, that YOU love one another; just as I have loved YOU, that YOU also love one another.
</br>35 By this all will know that YOU are my disciples, if YOU have love among yourselves.”
<p></p>
</br>36 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered: “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterwards.”
</br>37 Peter said to him: “Lord, why is it I cannot follow you at present? I will surrender my soul in your behalf.”
</br>38 Jesus answered: “Will you surrender your soul in my behalf? Most truly I say to you, A cock will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.”

</br>10 If YOU observe my commandments, YOU will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.
<p></p>
</br>11 “These things I have spoken to YOU, that my joy may be in YOU and YOUR joy may be made full.
</br>12 This is my commandment, that YOU love one another just as I have loved YOU.
</br>13 No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.
</br>14 YOU are my friends if YOU do what I am commanding YOU.
</br>15 I no longer call YOU slaves, because a slave does not know what his master does. But I have called YOU friends, because all the things I have heard from my Father I have made known to YOU.
</br>16 YOU did not choose me, but I chose YOU, and I appointed YOU to go on and keep bearing fruit and that YOUR fruit should remain; in order that no matter what YOU ask the Father in my name he might give it to YOU.
<p></p>
</br>17 “These things I command YOU, that YOU love one another.
</br>18 If the world hates YOU, YOU know that it has hated me before it hated YOU.
</br>19 If YOU were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because YOU are no part of the world, but I have chosen YOU out of the world, on this account the world hates YOU.
</br>20 Bear in mind the word I said to YOU, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute YOU also; if they have observed my word, they will observe YOURS also.
</br>21 But they will do all these things against YOU on account of my name, because they do not know him that sent me.
</br>22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
</br>23 He that hates me hates also my Father.
</br>24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen and hated me as well as my Father.
</br>25 But it is that the word written in their Law may be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without cause.’
</br>26 When the helper arrives that I will send YOU from the Father, the spirit of the truth, which proceeds from the Father, that one will bear witness about me;
</br>27 and YOU, in turn, are to bear witness, because YOU have been with me from when I began.

</br>2 Men will expel YOU from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone that kills YOU will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God.
</br>3 But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me.
</br>4 Nevertheless, I have spoken these things to YOU that, when the hour for them arrives, YOU may remember I told them to YOU.
<p></p>
“These things, however, I did not tell YOU at first, because I was with YOU.
</br>5 But now I am going to him that sent me, and yet not one of YOU asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
</br>6 But because I have spoken these things to YOU grief has filled YOUR hearts.
</br>7 Nevertheless, I am telling YOU the truth, It is for YOUR benefit I am going away. For if I do not go away, the helper will by no means come to YOU; but if I do go my way, I will send him to YOU.
</br>8 And when that one arrives he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:
</br>9 in the first place, concerning sin, because they are not exercising faith in me;
</br>10 then concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and YOU will behold me no longer;
</br>11 then concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
<p></p>
</br>12 “I have many things yet to say to YOU, but YOU are not able to bear them at present.
</br>13 However, when that one arrives, the spirit of the truth, he will guide YOU into all the truth, for he will not speak of his own impulse, but what things he hears he will speak, and he will declare to YOU the things coming.
</br>14 That one will glorify me, because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to YOU.
</br>15 All the things that the Father has are mine. That is why I said he receives from what is mine and declares [it] to YOU.
</br>16 In a little while YOU will behold me no longer, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me.”
<p></p>
</br>17 Therefore some of his disciples said to one another: “What does this mean that he says to us, ‘In a little while YOU will not behold me, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me,’ and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”
</br>18 Hence they were saying: “What does this mean that he says, ‘a little while’? We do not know what he is talking about.”
</br>19 Jesus knew they were wanting to question him, so he said to them: “Are YOU inquiring among yourselves over this, because I said, In a little while YOU will not behold me, and, again, in a little while YOU will see me?
</br>20 Most truly I say to YOU, YOU will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; YOU will be grieved, but YOUR grief will be turned into joy.
</br>21 A woman, when she is giving birth, has grief, because her hour has arrived; but when she has brought forth the young child, she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.
</br>22 YOU also, therefore, are now, indeed, having grief; but I shall see YOU again and YOUR hearts will rejoice, and YOUR joy no one will take from YOU.
</br>23 And in that day YOU will ask me no question at all. Most truly I say to YOU, If YOU ask the Father for anything he will give it to YOU in my name.
</br>24 Until this present time YOU have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask and YOU will receive, that YOUR joy may be made full.
<p></p>
</br>25 “I have spoken these things to YOU in comparisons. The hour is coming when I will speak to YOU no more in comparisons, but I will report to YOU with plainness concerning the Father.
</br>26 In that day YOU will ask in my name, and I do not say to YOU that I shall make request of the Father concerning YOU.
</br>27 For the Father himself has affection for YOU, because YOU have had affection for me and have believed that I came out as the Father’s representative.
</br>28 I came out from the Father and have come into the world. Further, I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father.”
<p></p>
</br>29 His disciples said: “See! Now you are speaking with plainness, and are uttering no comparison.
</br>30 Now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you. By this we believe that you came out from God.”
</br>31 Jesus answered them: “Do YOU believe at present?
</br>32 Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when YOU will be scattered each one to his own house and YOU will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

</br>2 according as you have given him authority over all flesh, that, as regards the whole [number] whom you have given him, he may give them everlasting life.
</br>3 This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.
</br>4 I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do.
</br>5 So now you, Father, glorify me alongside yourself with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.

</br>7 They have now come to know that all the things you gave me are from you;
</br>8 because the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and have certainly come to know that I came out as your representative, and they have believed that you sent me forth.

</br>12 When I was with them I used to watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me; and I have kept them, and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled.
</br>13 But now I am coming to you, and I am speaking these things in the world in order that they may have my joy in themselves to the full.

</br>1 Having said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the winter torrent of Kid´ron to where there was a garden, and he and his disciples entered into it.
</br>2 Now Judas, his betrayer, also knew the place, because Jesus had many times met there with his disciples.
</br>3 Therefore Judas took the soldier band and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons.
</br>4 Jesus, therefore, knowing all the things coming upon him, went forth and said to them: “Whom are YOU looking for?”
</br>5 They answered him: “Jesus the Naz·a·rene´.” He said to them: “I am [he].” Now Judas, his betrayer, was also standing with them.
<p></p>
</br>6 However, when he said to them: “I am [he],” they drew back and fell to the ground.
</br>7 Therefore he asked them again: “Whom are YOU looking for?” They said: “Jesus the Naz·a·rene´.”
</br>8 Jesus answered: “I told YOU I am [he]. If, therefore, it is I YOU are looking for, let these go”;
</br>9 in order that the word might be fulfilled which he said: “Of those whom you have given me I have not lost a single one.”
<p></p>
</br>10 Then Simon Peter, as he had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut his right ear off. The name of the slave was Malchus.
</br>11 Jesus, however, said to Peter: “Put the sword into [its] sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not by all means drink it?”
<p></p>
</br>12 Then the soldier band and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,
</br>13 and they led him first to An´nas; for he was father-in-law to Ca´ia·phas, who was high priest that year.
</br>14 Ca´ia·phas was, in fact, the one that counseled the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people.
<p></p>
</br>15 Now Simon Peter as well as another disciple was following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
</br>16 but Peter was standing outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
</br>17 The servant girl, the doorkeeper, then said to Peter: “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said: “I am not.”
</br>18 Now the slaves and the officers were standing about, as they had built a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.
<p></p>
</br>19 And so the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
</br>20 Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.
</br>21 Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.”
</br>22 After he said these things, one of the officers that was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said: “Is that the way you answer the chief priest?”
</br>23 Jesus answered him: “If I spoke wrongly, bear witness concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit me?”
</br>24 Then An´nas sent him away bound to Ca´ia·phas the high priest.
<p></p>
</br>25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said: “I am not.”
</br>26 One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said: “I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?”
</br>27 However, Peter denied it again; and immediately a cock crowed.
<p></p>
</br>28 Then they led Jesus from Ca´ia·phas to the governor’s palace. It was now early in the day. But they themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace, that they might not get defiled but might eat the passover.
</br>29 Therefore Pilate came outside to them and said: “What accusation do YOU bring against this man?”
</br>30 In answer they said to him: “If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”
</br>31 Hence Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and judge him according to YOUR law.” The Jews said to him: “It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.”
</br>32 This, in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said to signify what sort of death he was destined to die.
<p></p>
</br>33 So Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”
</br>34 Jesus answered: “Is it of your own originality that you say this, or did others tell you about me?”
</br>35 Pilate answered: “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you up to me. What did you do?”
</br>36 Jesus answered: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.”
</br>37 Therefore Pilate said to him: “Well, then, are you a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone that is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.”
</br>38 Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”
<p></p>
And after saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I find no fault in him.
</br>39 Moreover, YOU have a custom that I should release a man to YOU at the passover. Do YOU, therefore, wish me to release to YOU the king of the Jews?”
</br>40 Then they shouted again, saying: “Not this man, but Bar·ab´bas!” Now Bar·ab´bas was a robber.

<p></p>
</br>1 At that time, therefore, Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.
</br>2 And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him with a purple outer garment;
</br>3 and they began coming up to him and saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!” Also, they would give him slaps in the face.
</br>4 And Pilate went outside again and said to them: “See! I bring him outside to YOU in order for YOU to know I find no fault in him.”
</br>5 Accordingly Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple outer garment. And he said to them: “Look! The man!”
</br>6 However, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying: “Impale [him]! Impale [him]!” Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and impale him, for I do not find any fault in him.”
</br>7 The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself God’s son.”
<p></p>
</br>8 When, therefore, Pilate heard this saying, he became more fearful;
</br>9 and he entered into the governor’s palace again and said to Jesus: “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
</br>10 Hence Pilate said to him: “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know I have authority to release you and I have authority to impale you?”
</br>11 Jesus answered him: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man that handed me over to you has greater sin.”
<p></p>
</br>12 For this reason Pilate kept on seeking how to release him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you release this [man], you are not a friend of Caesar. Every man making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
</br>13 Therefore Pilate, after hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called The Stone Pavement, but, in Hebrew, Gab´ba·tha.
</br>14 Now it was preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: “See! YOUR king!”
</br>15 However, they shouted: “Take [him] away! Take [him] away! Impale him!” Pilate said to them: “Shall I impale YOUR king?” The chief priests answered: “We have no king but Caesar.”
</br>16 At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled.
<p></p>
Then they took charge of Jesus.
</br>17 And, bearing the torture stake for himself, he went out to the so-called Skull Place, which is called Gol´go·tha in Hebrew;
</br>18 and there they impaled him, and two other [men] with him, one on this side and one on that, but Jesus in the middle.
</br>19 Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the torture stake. It was written: “Jesus the Naz·a·rene´ the King of the Jews.”
</br>20 Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.
</br>21 However, the chief priests of the Jews began to say to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”
</br>22 Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”
<p></p>
</br>23 Now when the soldiers had impaled Jesus, they took his outer garments and made four parts, for each soldier a part, and the inner garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from the top throughout its length.
</br>24 Therefore they said to one another: “Let us not tear it, but let us determine by lots over it whose it will be.” This was that the scripture might be fulfilled: “They apportioned my outer garments among themselves, and upon my apparel they cast lots.” And so the soldiers really did these things.
<p></p>
</br>25 By the torture stake of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and the sister of his mother; Mary the wife of Clo´pas, and Mary Mag´da·lene.
</br>26 Therefore Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!”
</br>27 Next he said to the disciple: “See! Your mother!” And from that hour on the disciple took her to his own home.
<p></p>
</br>28 After this, when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished, in order that the scripture might be accomplished he said: “I am thirsty.”
</br>29 A vessel was sitting there full of sour wine. Therefore they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a hyssop [stalk] and brought it to his mouth.
</br>30 When, now, he had received the sour wine, Jesus said: “It has been accomplished!” and, bowing his head, he delivered up [his] spirit.
<p></p>
</br>31 Then the Jews, since it was Preparation, in order that the bodies might not remain upon the torture stakes on the Sabbath, (for the day of that Sabbath was a great one,) requested Pilate to have their legs broken and the [bodies] taken away.
</br>32 The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first [man] and those of the other [man] that had been impaled with him.
</br>33 But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
</br>34 Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
</br>35 And he that has seen [it] has borne witness, and his witness is true, and that man knows he tells true things, in order that YOU also may believe.
</br>36 In fact, these things took place in order for the scripture to be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be crushed.”
</br>37 And, again, a different scripture says: “They will look to the One whom they pierced.”
<p></p>
</br>38 Now after these things Joseph from Ar·i·ma·the´a, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one out of [his] fear of the Jews, requested Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body away.
</br>39 Nic·o·de´mus also, the man that came to him in the night the first time, came bringing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [of it].
</br>40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it up with bandages with the spices, just the way the Jews have the custom of preparing for burial.
</br>41 Incidentally, at the place where he was impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a new memorial tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.
</br>42 There, then, on account of the preparation of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the memorial tomb was nearby.

</br>1 On the first day of the week Mary Mag´da·lene came to the memorial tomb early, while there was still darkness, and she beheld the stone already taken away from the memorial tomb.
</br>2 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, for whom Jesus had affection, and she said to them: “They have taken away the Lord out of the memorial tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”
<p></p>
</br>3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out and started for the memorial tomb.
</br>4 Yes, the two together began to run; but the other disciple ran ahead of Peter with greater speed and reached the memorial tomb first.
</br>5 And, stooping forward, he beheld the bandages lying, yet he did not go in.
</br>6 Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he entered into the memorial tomb. And he viewed the bandages lying,
</br>7 also the cloth that had been upon his head not lying with the bandages but separately rolled up in one place.
</br>8 At that time, therefore, the other disciple who had reached the memorial tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.
</br>9 For they did not yet discern the scripture that he must rise from the dead.
</br>10 And so the disciples went back to their homes.
<p></p>
</br>11 Mary, however, kept standing outside near the memorial tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she stooped forward to look into the memorial tomb
</br>12 and she viewed two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.
</br>13 And they said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them: “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have laid him.”
</br>14 After saying these things, she turned back and viewed Jesus standing, but she did not discern it was Jesus.
</br>15 Jesus said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She, imagining it was the gardener, said to him: “Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
</br>16 Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Upon turning around, she said to him, in Hebrew: “Rab·bo´ni!” (which means “Teacher!”)
</br>17 Jesus said to her: “Stop clinging to me. For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But be on your way to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and YOUR Father and to my God and YOUR God.’”
</br>18 Mary Mag´da·lene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!” and that he said these things to her.
<p></p>
</br>19 Therefore, when it was late on that day, the first of the week, and, although the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them: “May YOU have peace.”
</br>20 And after he said this he showed them both his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.
</br>21 Jesus, therefore, said to them again: “May YOU have peace. Just as the Father has sent me forth, I also am sending YOU.”
</br>22 And after he said this he blew upon them and said to them: “Receive holy spirit.
</br>23 If YOU forgive the sins of any persons, they stand forgiven to them; if YOU retain those of any persons, they stand retained.”
<p></p>
</br>24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called The Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
</br>25 Consequently the other disciples would say to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”
<p></p>
</br>26 Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst and said: “May YOU have peace.”
</br>27 Next he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop being unbelieving but become believing.”
</br>28 In answer Thomas said to him: “My Lord and my God!”
</br>29 Jesus said to him: “Because you have seen me have you believed? Happy are those who do not see and yet believe.”
<p></p>
</br>30 To be sure, Jesus performed many other signs also before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll.
</br>31 But these have been written down that YOU may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, YOU may have life by means of his name.

</br>1 After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Ti·be´ri·as; but he made the manifestation in this way.
</br>2 There were in company Simon Peter and Thomas, who was called The Twin, and Na·than´a·el from Ca´na of Gal´i·lee and the sons of Zeb´e·dee and two others of his disciples.
</br>3 Simon Peter said to them: “I am going fishing.” They said to him: “We also are coming with you.” Out they went and got aboard the boat, but during that night they caught nothing.
<p></p>
</br>4 However, just as it was getting to be morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not, of course, discern that it was Jesus.
</br>5 Then Jesus said to them: “Young children, YOU do not have anything to eat, do YOU?” They answered “No!” to him.
</br>6 He said to them: “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and YOU will find [some].” Then they cast it, but they were no longer able to draw it in because of the multitude of the fishes.
</br>7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus used to love said to Peter: “It is the Lord!” Hence Simon Peter, upon hearing that it was the Lord, girded about himself his top garment, for he was naked, and plunged into the sea.
</br>8 But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not a long way from land, only about three hundred feet away, dragging the net of fishes.
<p></p>
</br>9 However, when they disembarked onto land they beheld lying there a charcoal fire and fish lying upon it and bread.
</br>10 Jesus said to them: “Bring some of the fish YOU just now caught.”
</br>11 Simon Peter, therefore, went on board and drew the net to land full of big fishes, one hundred and fifty-three of them. But although there were so many the net did not burst.
</br>12 Jesus said to them: “Come, take YOUR breakfast.” Not one of the disciples had the courage to inquire of him: “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.
</br>13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
</br>14 This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after his being raised up from the dead.
<p></p>
</br>15 When, now, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Feed my lambs.”
</br>16 Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Shepherd my little sheep.”
</br>17 He said to him the third time: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” Peter became grieved that he said to him the third time: “Do you have affection for me?” So he said to him: “Lord, you know all things; you are aware that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him: “Feed my little sheep.
</br>18 Most truly I say to you, When you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another [man] will gird you and bear you where you do not wish.”
</br>19 This he said to signify by what sort of death he would glorify God. So, when he had said this, he said to him: “Continue following me.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Upon turning about Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus used to love following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back upon his breast and said: “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”
</br>21 Accordingly, when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this [man do]?”
</br>22 Jesus said to him: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.”
</br>23 In consequence, this saying went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?”
<p></p>
</br>24 This is the disciple that bears witness about these things and that wrote these things, and we know that the witness he gives is true.
<p></p>
</br>25 There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.
