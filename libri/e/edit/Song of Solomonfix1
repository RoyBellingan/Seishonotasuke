</br>1 The superlative song, which is Sol´o·mon’s:
</br>2 “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your expressions of endearment are better than wine.
</br>3 For fragrance your oils are good. Like an oil that is poured out is your name. That is why maidens themselves have loved you.
</br>4 Draw me with you; let us run. The king has brought me into his interior rooms! Do let us be joyful and rejoice in you. Do let us mention your expressions of endearment more than wine. Deservedly they have loved you.
<p></p>
</br>5 “A black girl I am, but comely, O YOU daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Ke´dar, [yet] like the tent cloths of Sol´o·mon.
</br>6 Do not YOU look at me because I am swarthy, because the sun has caught sight of me. The sons of my own mother grew angry with me; they appointed me the keeper of the vineyards, [although] my vineyard, one that was mine, I did not keep.
<p></p>
</br>7 “Do tell me, O you whom my soul has loved, where you do shepherding, where you make the flock lie down at midday. Just why should I become like a woman wrapped in mourning among the droves of your partners?”
<p></p>
</br>8 “If you do not know for yourself, O you most beautiful one among women, go out yourself in the footprints of the flock and pasture your kids of the goats alongside the tabernacles of the shepherds.”
<p></p>
</br>9 “To a mare of mine in the chariots of Phar´aoh I have likened you, O girl companion of mine.
</br>10 Your cheeks are comely among the hair braids, your neck in a string of beads.
</br>11 Circlets of gold we shall make for you, along with studs of silver.”
<p></p>
</br>12 “As long as the king is at his round table my own spikenard has given out its fragrance.
</br>13 As a bag of myrrh my dear one is to me; between my breasts he will spend the night.
</br>14 As a cluster of henna my dear one is to me, among the vineyards of En-ge´di.”
<p></p>
</br>15 “Look! You are beautiful, O girl companion of mine. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are [those of] doves.”
<p></p>
</br>16 “Look! You are beautiful, my dear one, also pleasant. Our divan also is one of foliage.
</br>17 The beams of our grand house are cedars, our rafters juniper trees.

<p></p>
</br>2 “Like a lily among thorny weeds, so is my girl companion among the daughters.”
<p></p>
</br>3 “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my dear one among the sons. His shade I have passionately desired, and there I have sat down, and his fruit has been sweet to my palate.
</br>4 He brought me into the house of wine, and his banner over me was love.
</br>5 Do YOU people refresh me with cakes of raisins, sustain me with apples; for I am lovesick.
</br>6 His left hand is under my head; and his right hand—it embraces me.
</br>7 I have put YOU under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the female gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that YOU try not to awaken or arouse love [in me] until it feels inclined.
<p></p>
</br>8 “The sound of my dear one! Look! This one is coming, climbing upon the mountains, leaping upon the hills.
</br>9 My dear one is resembling a gazelle or the young of the stags. Look! This one is standing behind our wall, gazing through the windows, glancing through the lattices.
</br>10 My dear one has answered and said to me, ‘Rise up, you girl companion of mine, my beautiful one, and come away.
</br>11 For, look! the rainy season itself has passed, the downpour itself is over, it has gone its way.
</br>12 Blossoms themselves have appeared in the land, the very time of vine trimming has arrived, and the voice of the turtledove itself has been heard in our land.
</br>13 As for the fig tree, it has gained a mature color for its early figs; and the vines are abloom, they have given [their] fragrance. Rise up, come, O girl companion of mine, my beautiful one, and come away.
</br>14 O my dove in the retreats of the crag, in the concealed place of the steep way, show me your form, let me hear your voice, for your voice is pleasurable and your form is comely.’”
<p></p>
</br>15 “Do YOU people grab hold of the foxes for us, the little foxes that are making spoil of the vineyards, as our vineyards are abloom.”
<p></p>
</br>16 “My dear one is mine and I am his. He is shepherding among the lilies.

</br>2 Let me rise up, please, and go round about in the city; in the streets and in the public squares let me seek the one whom my soul has loved. I sought him, but I did not find him.
</br>3 The watchmen who were going around in the city found me, ‘The one whom my soul has loved have YOU men seen?’
</br>4 Hardly had I passed on from them until I found the one whom my soul has loved. I grabbed hold of him, and I would not let go of him, until I had brought him into my mother’s house and into the interior room of her that had been pregnant with me.
</br>5 I have put YOU under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the female gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that YOU try not to awaken or arouse love [in me] until it feels inclined.”

</br>8 all of them in possession of a sword, being taught in warfare, each one with his sword upon his thigh because of dread during the nights.”

</br>9 “It is the litter that King Sol´o·mon has made for himself from the trees of Leb´a·non.
</br>10 Its pillars he has made of silver, its supports of gold. Its seat is of wool dyed reddish purple, its interior being fitted out lovingly by the daughters of Jerusalem.”

</br>2 Your teeth are like a drove of freshly shorn [ewes] that have gone up from the washing, all of which are bearing twins, with none among them having lost its young ones.

</br>10 How beautiful your expressions of endearment are, O my sister, my bride! How much better your expressions of endearment are than wine and the fragrance of your oils than all sorts of perfume!
</br>11 With comb honey your lips keep dripping, O [my] bride. Honey and milk are under your tongue, and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Leb´a·non.
</br>12 A garden barred in is my sister, [my] bride, a garden barred in, a spring sealed up.

</br>5 I got up, even I, to open to my dear one, and my own hands dripped with myrrh and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the hollows of the lock.
</br>6 I opened, even I, to my dear one, but my dear one himself had turned away, he had passed along. My very soul had gone out [of me] when he spoke. I sought him, but I did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer me.
