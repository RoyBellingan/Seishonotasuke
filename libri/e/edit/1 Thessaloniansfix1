</br>1 Paul and Sil·va´nus and Timothy to the congregation of the Thes·sa·lo´ni·ans in union with God the Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ:
<p></p>
May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace.
<p></p>
</br>2 We always thank God when we make mention concerning all of YOU in our prayers,
</br>3 for we bear incessantly in mind YOUR faithful work and [your] loving labor and [your] endurance due to [your] hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.
</br>4 For we know, brothers loved by God, his choosing of YOU,
</br>5 because the good news we preach did not turn up among YOU with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and strong conviction, just as YOU know what sort of men we became to YOU for YOUR sakes;
</br>6 and YOU became imitators of us and of the Lord, seeing that YOU accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit,
</br>7 so that YOU came to be an example to all the believers in Mac·e·do´ni·a and in A·cha´ia.
<p></p>
</br>8 The fact is, not only has the word of Jehovah sounded forth from YOU in Mac·e·do´ni·a and A·cha´ia, but in every place YOUR faith toward God has spread abroad, so that we do not need to say anything.
</br>9 For they themselves keep reporting about the way we first entered in among YOU and how YOU turned to God from [YOUR] idols to slave for a living and true God,
</br>10 and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised up from the dead, namely, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.

</br>1 To be sure, YOU yourselves know, brothers, how our visit to YOU has not been without results,
</br>2 but how, after we had first suffered and been insolently treated (just as YOU know) in Phi·lip´pi, we mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to YOU the good news of God with a great deal of struggling.
</br>3 For the exhortation we give does not arise from error or from uncleanness or with deceit,
</br>4 but, just as we have been proved by God as fit to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, as pleasing, not men, but God, who makes proof of our hearts.
<p></p>
</br>5 In fact, at no time have we turned up either with flattering speech, (just as YOU know) or with a false front for covetousness, God is witness!
</br>6 Neither have we been seeking glory from men, no, either from YOU or from others, though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.
</br>7 To the contrary, we became gentle in the midst of YOU, as when a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
</br>8 So, having a tender affection for YOU, we were well pleased to impart to YOU, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because YOU became beloved to us.
<p></p>
</br>9 Certainly YOU bear in mind, brothers, our labor and toil. It was with working night and day, so as not to put an expensive burden upon any one of YOU, that we preached the good news of God to YOU.
</br>10 YOU are witnesses, God is also, how loyal and righteous and unblamable we proved to be to YOU believers.
</br>11 In harmony with that YOU well know how, as a father does his children, we kept exhorting each one of YOU, and consoling and bearing witness to YOU,
</br>12 to the end that YOU should go on walking worthily of God who is calling YOU to his kingdom and glory.
<p></p>
</br>13 Indeed, that is why we also thank God incessantly, because when YOU received God’s word, which YOU heard from us, YOU accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in YOU believers.
</br>14 For YOU became imitators, brothers, of the congregations of God that are in Ju·de´a in union with Christ Jesus, because YOU also began suffering at the hands of YOUR own countrymen the same things as they also [are suffering] at the hands of the Jews,
</br>15 who killed even the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us. Furthermore, they are not pleasing God, but are against [the interests of] all men,
</br>16 as they try to hinder us from speaking to people of the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But his wrath has at length come upon them.
<p></p>
</br>17 As for ourselves, brothers, when we were bereaved of YOU for but a short time, in person, not in heart, we endeavored far more than is usual to see YOUR faces with great desire.
</br>18 For this reason we wanted to come to YOU, yes, I Paul, both once and a second time, but Satan cut across our path.
</br>19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact YOU?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence?
</br>20 YOU certainly are our glory and joy.

</br>1 Hence, when we could bear it no longer, we saw good to be left alone in Athens;
</br>2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the good news about the Christ, in order to make YOU firm and comfort YOU in behalf of YOUR faith,
</br>3 that no one might be swayed by these tribulations. For YOU yourselves know we are appointed to this very thing.
</br>4 In fact, too, when we were with YOU, we used to tell YOU beforehand that we were destined to suffer tribulation, just as it has also happened and as YOU know.
</br>5 That is why, indeed, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to know of YOUR faithfulness, as perhaps in some way the Tempter might have tempted YOU, and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.
<p></p>
</br>6 But Timothy has just now come to us from YOU and given us the good news about YOUR faithfulness and love, and that YOU continue having good remembrance of us always, yearning to see us in the same way, indeed, as we also do YOU.
</br>7 That is why, brothers, we have been comforted over YOU in all our necessity and tribulation through the faithfulness YOU show,
</br>8 because now we live if YOU stand firm in [the] Lord.
</br>9 For what thanksgiving can we render to God concerning YOU in return for all the joy with which we are rejoicing on YOUR account before our God,
</br>10 while night and day we make more than extraordinary supplications to see YOUR faces and to make good the things that are lacking about YOUR faith?
<p></p>
</br>11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way prosperously to YOU.
</br>12 Moreover, may the Lord cause YOU to increase, yes, make YOU abound, in love to one another and to all, even as we also do to YOU;
</br>13 to the end that he may make YOUR hearts firm, unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the presence of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.

</br>1 Finally, brothers, we request YOU and exhort YOU by the Lord Jesus, just as YOU received [the instruction] from us on how YOU ought to walk and please God, just as YOU are in fact walking, that YOU would keep on doing it more fully.
</br>2 For YOU know the orders we gave YOU through the Lord Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>3 For this is what God wills, the sanctifying of YOU, that YOU abstain from fornication;
</br>4 that each one of YOU should know how to get possession of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
</br>5 not in covetous sexual appetite such as also those nations have which do not know God;
</br>6 that no one go to the point of harming and encroach upon the rights of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah is one who exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told YOU beforehand and also gave YOU a thorough witness.
</br>7 For God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification.
</br>8 So, then, the man that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in YOU.
<p></p>
</br>9 However, with reference to brotherly love, YOU do not need us to be writing YOU, for YOU yourselves are taught by God to love one another;
</br>10 and, in fact, YOU are doing it to all the brothers in all of Mac·e·do´ni·a. But we exhort YOU, brothers, to go on doing it in fuller measure,
</br>11 and to make it YOUR aim to live quietly and to mind YOUR own business and work with YOUR hands, just as we ordered YOU;
</br>12 so that YOU may be walking decently as regards people outside and not be needing anything.
<p></p>
</br>13 Moreover, brothers, we do not want YOU to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping [in death]; that YOU may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.
</br>14 For if our faith is that Jesus died and rose again, so, too, those who have fallen asleep [in death] through Jesus God will bring with him.
</br>15 For this is what we tell YOU by Jehovah’s word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep [in death];
</br>16 because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.
</br>17 Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with [the] Lord.
</br>18 Consequently keep comforting one another with these words.

</br>1 Now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, YOU need nothing to be written to YOU.
</br>2 For YOU yourselves know quite well that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.
</br>3 Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman; and they will by no means escape.
</br>4 But YOU, brothers, YOU are not in darkness, so that that day should overtake YOU as it would thieves,
</br>5 for YOU are all sons of light and sons of day. We belong neither to night nor to darkness.
<p></p>
</br>6 So, then, let us not sleep on as the rest do, but let us stay awake and keep our senses.
</br>7 For those who sleep are accustomed to sleep at night, and those who get drunk are usually drunk at night.
</br>8 But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation;
</br>9 because God assigned us, not to wrath, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
</br>10 He died for us, that, whether we stay awake or are asleep, we should live together with him.
</br>11 Therefore keep comforting one another and building one another up, just as YOU are in fact doing.
<p></p>
</br>12 Now we request YOU, brothers, to have regard for those who are working hard among YOU and presiding over YOU in [the] Lord and admonishing YOU;
</br>13 and to give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work. Be peaceable with one another.
</br>14 On the other hand, we exhort YOU, brothers, admonish the disorderly, speak consolingly to the depressed souls, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all.
</br>15 See that no one renders injury for injury to anyone else, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.
<p></p>
</br>16 Always be rejoicing.
</br>17 Pray incessantly.
</br>18 In connection with everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in union with Christ Jesus respecting YOU.
</br>19 Do not put out the fire of the spirit.
</br>20 Do not treat prophesyings with contempt.
</br>21 Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.
</br>22 Abstain from every form of wickedness.
<p></p>
</br>23 May the very God of peace sanctify YOU completely. And sound in every respect may the spirit and soul and body of YOU [brothers] be preserved in a blameless manner at the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</br>24 He who is calling YOU is faithful, and he will also do it.
<p></p>
</br>25 Brothers, continue in prayer for us.
<p></p>
</br>26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
<p></p>
</br>27 I am putting YOU under the solemn obligation by the Lord for this letter to be read to all the brothers.
<p></p>
</br>28 The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with YOU.
