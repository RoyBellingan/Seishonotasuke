</br>1 There happened to be a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man proved to be blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.
</br>2 And seven sons and three daughters came to be born to him.
</br>3 And his livestock got to be seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred spans of cattle and five hundred she-asses, along with a very large body of servants; and that man came to be the greatest of all the Orientals.
<p></p>
</br>4 And his sons went and held a banquet at the house of each one on his own day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
</br>5 And it would occur that when the banquet days had gone round the circuit, Job would send and sanctify them; and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them; for, said Job, “maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is the way Job would do always.
<p></p>
</br>6 Now it came to be the day when the sons of the [true] God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them.
<p></p>
</br>7 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where do you come from?” At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: “From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.”
</br>8 And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?”
</br>9 At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?
</br>10 Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth.
</br>11 But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] whether he will not curse you to your very face.”
</br>12 Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!” So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>13 Now it came to be the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother the firstborn.
</br>14 And there came a messenger to Job, and he proceeded to say: “The cattle themselves happened to be plowing and the she-asses were grazing at the side of them
</br>15 when the Sa·be´ans came making a raid and taking them, and the attendants they struck down with the edge of the sword; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.”
<p></p>
</br>16 While this one was yet speaking that one came and proceeded to say: “The very fire of God fell from the heavens and went blazing among the sheep and the attendants and eating them up; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.”
<p></p>
</br>17 While that one was yet speaking another one came and proceeded to say: “The Chal·de´ans made up three bands and went dashing against the camels and taking them, and the attendants they struck down with the edge of the sword; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.”
<p></p>
</br>18 While this other one was yet speaking, still another one came and proceeded to say: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother the firstborn.
</br>19 And, look! there came a great wind from the region of the wilderness, and it went striking the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died. And I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.”
<p></p>
</br>20 And Job proceeded to get up and rip his sleeveless coat apart and cut the hair off his head and fall to the earth and bow down
</br>21 and say:

@@citzAnd naked shall I return there.

</br>1 Afterward it came to be the day when the sons of the [true] God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also proceeded to enter right among them to take his station before Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>2 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Just where do you come from?” At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: “From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.”
</br>3 And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad? Even yet he is holding fast his integrity, although you incite me against him to swallow him up without cause.”
</br>4 But Satan answered Jehovah and said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.
</br>5 For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh [and see] whether he will not curse you to your very face.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: “There he is in your hand! Only watch out for his soul itself!”
</br>7 So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah and struck Job with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
</br>8 And he proceeded to take for himself a fragment of earthenware with which to scrape himself; and he was sitting in among the ashes.
<p></p>
</br>9 Finally his wife said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!”
</br>10 But he said to her: “As one of the senseless women speaks, you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from the [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
<p></p>
</br>11 And three companions of Job got to hear of all this calamity that had come upon him, and they proceeded to come, each one from his own place, El´i·phaz the Te´man·ite and Bil´dad the Shu´hite and Zo´phar the Na´a·ma·thite. So they met together by appointment to come and sympathize with him and comfort him.
</br>12 When they raised their eyes from far off they did not then recognize him. And they proceeded to raise their voice and weep and rip each one his sleeveless coat apart and toss dust toward the heavens upon their heads.
</br>13 And they kept sitting with him on the earth seven days and seven nights, and there was no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that the pain was very great.

</br>7 And it came about after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah proceeded to say to El´i·phaz the Te´man·ite:
<p></p>
“My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for YOU men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.
</br>8 And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and YOU men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in YOUR own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for YOU. His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with YOU, for YOU have not spoken concerning me what is truthful, as has my servant Job.”
<p></p>
</br>9 Accordingly El´i·phaz the Te´man·ite and Bil´dad the Shu´hite [and] Zo´phar the Na´a·ma·thite went and did just as Jehovah had spoken to them; and so Jehovah accepted Job’s face.
<p></p>
</br>10 And Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job when he prayed in behalf of his companions, and Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount.
</br>11 And there kept coming to him all his brothers and all his sisters and all those formerly knowing him, and they began to eat bread with him in his house and to sympathize with him and to comfort him over all the calamity that Jehovah had let come upon him; and they proceeded each one to give him a piece of money and each one a gold ring.
<p></p>
</br>12 As for Jehovah, he blessed the end of Job afterward more than his beginning, so that he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand spans of cattle and a thousand she-asses.
</br>13 He also came to have seven sons and three daughters.
</br>14 And he went calling the name of the first Je·mi´mah and the name of the second Ke·zi´ah and the name of the third Ker´en-hap´puch.
</br>15 And no women were found as pretty as Job’s daughters in all the land, and their father proceeded to give them an inheritance in among their brothers.
<p></p>
</br>16 And Job continued living after this a hundred and forty years and came to see his sons and his grandsons—four generations.
</br>17 And gradually Job died, old and satisfied with days.
