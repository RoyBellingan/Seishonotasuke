</br>1 Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ and called to be an apostle, separated to God’s good news,
</br>2 which he promised aforetime through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
</br>3 concerning his Son, who sprang from the seed of David according to the flesh,
</br>4 but who with power was declared God’s Son according to the spirit of holiness by means of resurrection from the dead—yes, Jesus Christ our Lord,
</br>5 through whom we received undeserved kindness and an apostleship in order that there might be obedience of faith among all the nations respecting his name,
</br>6 among which [nations] YOU also are those called to belong to Jesus Christ—
</br>7 to all those who are in Rome as God’s beloved ones, called to be holy ones:
<p></p>
May YOU have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.
<p></p>
</br>8 First of all, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of YOU, because YOUR faith is talked about throughout the whole world.
</br>9 For God, to whom I render sacred service with my spirit in connection with the good news about his Son, is my witness of how without ceasing I always make mention of YOU in my prayers,
</br>10 begging that if at all possible I may now at last be prospered in the will of God so as to come to YOU.
</br>11 For I am longing to see YOU, that I may impart some spiritual gift to YOU in order for YOU to be made firm;
</br>12 or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among YOU, by each one through the other’s faith, both YOURS and mine.
<p></p>
</br>13 But I do not want YOU to fail to know, brothers, that I many times purposed to come to YOU, but I have been hindered until now, in order that I might acquire some fruitage also among YOU even as among the rest of the nations.
</br>14 Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to senseless ones I am a debtor:
</br>15 so there is eagerness on my part to declare the good news also to YOU there in Rome.
</br>16 For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek;
</br>17 for in it God’s righteousness is being revealed by reason of faith and toward faith, just as it is written: “But the righteous one—by means of faith he will live.”
<p></p>
</br>18 For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way,
</br>19 because what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them.
</br>20 For his invisible [qualities] are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable;
</br>21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened.
</br>22 Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish
</br>23 and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things.
<p></p>
</br>24 Therefore God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them,
</br>25 even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever. Amen.
</br>26 That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature;
</br>27 and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error.
<p></p>
</br>28 And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting,
</br>29 filled as they were with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malicious disposition, being whisperers,
</br>30 backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, self-assuming, inventors of injurious things, disobedient to parents,
</br>31 without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless.
</br>32 Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them but also consent with those practicing them.

</br>1 Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for in the thing in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, inasmuch as you that judge practice the same things.
</br>2 Now we know that the judgment of God is, in accord with truth, against those who practice such things.
<p></p>
</br>3 But do you have this idea, O man, while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, that you will escape the judgment of God?
</br>4 Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, because you do not know that the kindly [quality] of God is trying to lead you to repentance?
</br>5 But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment.
</br>6 And he will render to each one according to his works:
</br>7 everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good;
</br>8 however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and anger,
</br>9 tribulation and distress, upon the soul of every man who works what is injurious, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;
</br>10 but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.
</br>11 For there is no partiality with God.
<p></p>
</br>12 For instance, all those who sinned without law will also perish without law; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law.
</br>13 For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous.
</br>14 For whenever people of the nations that do not have law do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves.
</br>15 They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them and, between their own thoughts, they are being accused or even excused.
</br>16 This will be in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind, according to the good news I declare.
<p></p>
</br>17 If, now, you are a Jew in name and are resting upon law and taking pride in God,
</br>18 and you know his will and approve of things that are excellent because you are orally instructed out of the Law;
</br>19 and you are persuaded that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness,
</br>20 a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of babes, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law—
</br>21 do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching “Do not steal,” do you steal?
</br>22 You, the one saying “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You, the one expressing abhorrence of the idols, do you rob temples?
</br>23 You, who take pride in law, do you by your transgressing of the Law dishonor God?
</br>24 For “the name of God is being blasphemed on account of YOU people among the nations”; just as it is written.
<p></p>
</br>25 Circumcision is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
</br>26 If, therefore, an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not?
</br>27 And the uncircumcised [person] that is such by nature will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who with its written code and circumcision are a transgressor of law.
</br>28 For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh.
</br>29 But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and [his] circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code. The praise of that one comes, not from men, but from God.

<p></p>
</br>1 What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision?
</br>2 A great deal in every way. First of all, because they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.
</br>3 What, then, [is the case]? If some did not express faith, will their lack of faith perhaps make the faithfulness of God without effect?
</br>4 Never may that happen! But let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, even as it is written: “That you might be proved righteous in your words and might win when you are being judged.”
</br>5 However, if our unrighteousness brings God’s righteousness to the fore, what shall we say? God is not unjust when he vents his wrath, is he? (I am speaking as a man does.)
</br>6 Never may that happen! How, otherwise, will God judge the world?
<p></p>
</br>7 Yet if by reason of my lie the truth of God has been made more prominent to his glory, why am I also yet being judged as a sinner?
</br>8 And [why] not [say], just as it is falsely charged to us and just as some men state that we say: “Let us do the bad things that the good things may come”? The judgment against those [men] is in harmony with justice.
<p></p>
</br>9 What then? Are we in a better position? Not at all! For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin;
</br>10 just as it is written: “There is not a righteous [man], not even one;
</br>11 there is no one that has any insight, there is no one that seeks for God.
</br>12 All [men] have deflected, all of them together have become worthless; there is no one that does kindness, there is not so much as one.”
</br>13 “Their throat is an opened grave, they have used deceit with their tongues.” “Poison of asps is behind their lips.”
</br>14 “And their mouth is full of cursing and bitter expression.”
</br>15 “Their feet are speedy to shed blood.”
</br>16 “Ruin and misery are in their ways,
</br>17 and they have not known the way of peace.”
</br>18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
<p></p>
</br>19 Now we know that all the things the Law says it addresses to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become liable to God for punishment.
</br>20 Therefore by works of law no flesh will be declared righteous before him, for by law is the accurate knowledge of sin.
<p></p>
</br>21 But now apart from law God’s righteousness has been made manifest, as it is borne witness to by the Law and the Prophets;
</br>22 yes, God’s righteousness through the faith in Jesus Christ, for all those having faith. For there is no distinction.
</br>23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
</br>24 and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom [paid] by Christ Jesus.
</br>25 God set him forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood. This was in order to exhibit his own righteousness, because he was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past while God was exercising forbearance;
</br>26 so as to exhibit his own righteousness in this present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>27 Where, then, is the boasting? It is shut out. Through what law? That of works? No indeed, but through the law of faith.
</br>28 For we reckon that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law.
</br>29 Or is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of people of the nations? Yes, of people of the nations also,
</br>30 if truly God is one, who will declare circumcised people righteous as a result of faith and uncircumcised people righteous by means of their faith.
</br>31 Do we, then, abolish law by means of our faith? Never may that happen! On the contrary, we establish law.

<p></p>
</br>1 That being so, what shall we say about Abraham our forefather according to the flesh?
</br>2 If, for instance, Abraham were declared righteous as a result of works, he would have ground for boasting; but not with God.
</br>3 For what does the scripture say? “Abraham exercised faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
</br>4 Now to the man that works the pay is counted, not as an undeserved kindness, but as a debt.
</br>5 On the other hand, to the man that does not work but puts faith in him who declares the ungodly one righteous, his faith is counted as righteousness.
</br>6 Just as David also speaks of the happiness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:
</br>7 “Happy are those whose lawless deeds have been pardoned and whose sins have been covered;
</br>8 happy is the man whose sin Jehovah will by no means take into account.”
<p></p>
</br>9 Does this happiness, then, come upon circumcised people or also upon uncircumcised people? For we say: “His faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.”
</br>10 Under what circumstances, then, was it counted? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
</br>11 And he received a sign, namely, circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, that he might be the father of all those having faith while in uncircumcision, in order for righteousness to be counted to them;
</br>12 and a father of circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision, but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of that faith while in the uncircumcised state which our father Abraham had.
<p></p>
</br>13 For it was not through law that Abraham or his seed had the promise that he should be heir of a world, but it was through the righteousness by faith.
</br>14 For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith has been made useless and the promise has been abolished.
</br>15 In reality the Law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression.
<p></p>
</br>16 On this account it was as a result of faith, that it might be according to undeserved kindness, in order for the promise to be sure to all his seed, not only to that which adheres to the Law, but also to that which adheres to the faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all,
</br>17 just as it is written: “I have appointed you a father of many nations.”) This was in the sight of the One in whom he had faith, even of God, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they were.
</br>18 Although beyond hope, yet based on hope he had faith, that he might become the father of many nations in accord with what had been said: “So your seed will be.”
</br>19 And, although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now already deadened, as he was about one hundred years old, also the deadness of the womb of Sarah.
</br>20 But because of the promise of God he did not waver in a lack of faith, but became powerful by his faith, giving God glory
</br>21 and being fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do.
</br>22 Hence “it was counted to him as righteousness.”
<p></p>
</br>23 That “it was counted to him” was written, however, not for his sake only,
</br>24 but also for the sake of us to whom it is destined to be counted, because we believe on him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead.
</br>25 He was delivered up for the sake of our trespasses and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous.

</br>1 Therefore, now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
</br>2 through whom also we have gained our approach by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand; and let us exult, based on hope of the glory of God.
</br>3 And not only that, but let us exult while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance;
</br>4 endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope,
</br>5 and the hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given us.
<p></p>
</br>6 For, indeed, Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time.
</br>7 For hardly will anyone die for a righteous [man]; indeed, for the good [man], perhaps, someone even dares to die.
</br>8 But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
</br>9 Much more, therefore, since we have been declared righteous now by his blood, shall we be saved through him from wrath.
</br>10 For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
</br>11 And not only that, but we are also exulting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
<p></p>
</br>12 That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.
</br>13 For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law.
</br>14 Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam, who bears a resemblance to him that was to come.
<p></p>
</br>15 But it is not with the gift as it was with the trespass. For if by one man’s trespass many died, the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift with the undeserved kindness by the one man Jesus Christ abounded much more to many.
</br>16 Also, it is not with the free gift as it was with the way things worked through the one [man] that sinned. For the judgment resulted from one trespass in condemnation, but the gift resulted from many trespasses in a declaration of righteousness.
</br>17 For if by the trespass of the one [man] death ruled as king through that one, much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness rule as kings in life through the one [person], Jesus Christ.
<p></p>
</br>18 So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, likewise also through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is a declaring of them righteous for life.
</br>19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience of the one [person] many will be constituted righteous.
</br>20 Now the Law came in beside in order that trespassing might abound. But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more.
</br>21 To what end? That, just as sin ruled as king with death, likewise also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness with everlasting life in view through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p></p>
</br>1 Consequently, what shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that undeserved kindness may abound?
</br>2 Never may that happen! Seeing that we died with reference to sin, how shall we keep on living any longer in it?
</br>3 Or do YOU not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
</br>4 Therefore we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, we also should likewise walk in a newness of life.
</br>5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be [united with him in the likeness] of his resurrection;
</br>6 because we know that our old personality was impaled with [him], that our sinful body might be made inactive, that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin.
</br>7 For he who has died has been acquitted from [his] sin.
<p></p>
</br>8 Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.
</br>9 For we know that Christ, now that he has been raised up from the dead, dies no more; death is master over him no more.
</br>10 For [the death] that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time; but [the life] that he lives, he lives with reference to God.
</br>11 Likewise also YOU: reckon yourselves to be dead indeed with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus.
<p></p>
</br>12 Therefore do not let sin continue to rule as king in YOUR mortal bodies that YOU should obey their desires.
</br>13 Neither go on presenting YOUR members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also YOUR members to God as weapons of righteousness.
</br>14 For sin must not be master over YOU, seeing that YOU are not under law but under undeserved kindness.
<p></p>
</br>15 What follows? Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Never may that happen!
</br>16 Do YOU not know that if YOU keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, YOU are slaves of him because YOU obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view?
</br>17 But thanks to God that YOU were the slaves of sin but YOU became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which YOU were handed over.
</br>18 Yes, since YOU were set free from sin, YOU became slaves to righteousness.
</br>19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of YOUR flesh: for even as YOU presented YOUR members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness with lawlessness in view, so now present YOUR members as slaves to righteousness with holiness in view.
</br>20 For when YOU were slaves of sin, YOU were free as to righteousness.
<p></p>
</br>21 What, then, was the fruit that YOU used to have at that time? Things of which YOU are now ashamed. For the end of those things is death.
</br>22 However, now, because YOU were set free from sin but became slaves to God, YOU are having YOUR fruit in the way of holiness, and the end everlasting life.
</br>23 For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.

</br>1 Can it be that YOU do not know, brothers, (for I am speaking to those who know law,) that the Law is master over a man as long as he lives?
</br>2 For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law of her husband.
</br>3 So, then, while her husband is living, she would be styled an adulteress if she became another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man’s.
<p></p>
</br>4 So, my brothers, YOU also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ, that YOU might become another’s, the one’s who was raised up from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God.
</br>5 For when we were in accord with the flesh, the sinful passions that were excited by the Law were at work in our members that we should bring forth fruit to death.
</br>6 But now we have been discharged from the Law, because we have died to that by which we were being held fast, that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit, and not in the old sense by the written code.
<p></p>
</br>7 What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: “You must not covet.”
</br>8 But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead.
</br>9 In fact, I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died.
</br>10 And the commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death.
</br>11 For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it.
</br>12 Wherefore, on its part, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
<p></p>
</br>13 Did, then, what is good become death to me? Never may that happen! But sin did, that it might be shown as sin working out death for me through that which is good; that sin might become far more sinful through the commandment.
</br>14 For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
</br>15 For what I am working out I do not know. For what I wish, this I do not practice; but what I hate is what I do.
</br>16 However, if what I do not wish is what I do, I agree that the Law is fine.
</br>17 But now the one working it out is no longer I, but sin that resides in me.
</br>18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for ability to wish is present with me, but ability to work out what is fine is not [present].
</br>19 For the good that I wish I do not do, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.
</br>20 If, now, what I do not wish is what I do, the one working it out is no longer I, but the sin dwelling in me.
<p></p>
</br>21 I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.
</br>22 I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,
</br>23 but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.
</br>24 Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?
</br>25 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with [my] mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with [my] flesh to sin’s law.

</br>1 Therefore those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation.
</br>2 For the law of that spirit which gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
</br>3 For, there being an incapability on the part of the Law, while it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
</br>4 that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk, not in accord with the flesh, but in accord with the spirit.
</br>5 For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit.
</br>6 For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace;
</br>7 because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be.
</br>8 So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.
<p></p>
</br>9 However, YOU are in harmony, not with the flesh, but with the spirit, if God’s spirit truly dwells in YOU. But if anyone does not have Christ’s spirit, this one does not belong to him.
</br>10 But if Christ is in union with YOU, the body indeed is dead on account of sin, but the spirit is life on account of righteousness.
</br>11 If, now, the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in YOU, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make YOUR mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in YOU.
<p></p>
</br>12 So, then, brothers, we are under obligation, not to the flesh to live in accord with the flesh;
</br>13 for if YOU live in accord with the flesh YOU are sure to die; but if YOU put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, YOU will live.
</br>14 For all who are led by God’s spirit, these are God’s sons.
</br>15 For YOU did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but YOU received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: “Abba, Father!”
</br>16 The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.
</br>17 If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.
<p></p>
</br>18 Consequently I reckon that the sufferings of the present season do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us.
</br>19 For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.
</br>20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but through him that subjected it, on the basis of hope
</br>21 that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.
</br>22 For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.
</br>23 Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves, while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom.
</br>24 For we were saved in [this] hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for when a man sees a thing, does he hope for it?
</br>25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we keep on waiting for it with endurance.
<p></p>
</br>26 In like manner the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the [problem of] what we should pray for as we need to we do not know, but the spirit itself pleads for us with groanings unuttered.
</br>27 Yet he who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in accord with God for holy ones.

</br>28 Now we know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God, those who are the ones called according to his purpose;
</br>29 because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
</br>30 Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous. Finally those whom he declared righteous are the ones he also glorified.
<p></p>
</br>31 What, then, shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who will be against us?
</br>32 He who did not even spare his own Son but delivered him up for us all, why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things?
</br>33 Who will file accusation against God’s chosen ones? God is the One who declares [them] righteous.
</br>34 Who is he that will condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, rather the one who was raised up from the dead, who is on the right hand of God, who also pleads for us.
<p></p>
</br>35 Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?
</br>36 Just as it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.”
</br>37 To the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us.
</br>38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers
</br>39 nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

</br>1 I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying, since my conscience bears witness with me in holy spirit,
</br>2 that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.
</br>3 For I could wish that I myself were separated as the cursed one from the Christ in behalf of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh,
</br>4 who, as such, are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the sacred service and the promises;
</br>5 to whom the forefathers belong and from whom the Christ [sprang] according to the flesh: God, who is over all, [be] blessed forever. Amen.
<p></p>
</br>6 However, it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who [spring] from Israel are really “Israel.”
</br>7 Neither because they are Abraham’s seed are they all children, but: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.”
</br>8 That is, the children in the flesh are not really the children of God, but the children by the promise are counted as the seed.
</br>9 For the word of promise was as follows: “At this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.”
</br>10 Yet not that case alone, but also when Re·bek´ah conceived twins from the one [man], Isaac our forefather:
</br>11 for when they had not yet been born nor had practiced anything good or vile, in order that the purpose of God respecting the choosing might continue dependent, not upon works, but upon the One who calls,
</br>12 it was said to her: “The older will be the slave of the younger.”
</br>13 Just as it is written: “I loved Jacob, but E´sau I hated.”
<p></p>
</br>14 What shall we say, then? Is there injustice with God? Never may that become so!
</br>15 For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy upon whomever I do have mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I do show compassion.”
</br>16 So, then, it depends, not upon the one wishing nor upon the one running, but upon God, who has mercy.
</br>17 For the Scripture says to Phar´aoh: “For this very cause I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may show my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.”
</br>18 So, then, upon whom he wishes he has mercy, but whom he wishes he lets become obstinate.
<p></p>
</br>19 You will therefore say to me: “Why does he yet find fault? For who has withstood his express will?”
</br>20 O man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, “Why did you make me this way?”
</br>21 What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use?
</br>22 If, now, God, although having the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, tolerated with much long-suffering vessels of wrath made fit for destruction,
</br>23 in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
</br>24 namely, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, [what of it]?
</br>25 It is as he says also in Ho·se´a: “Those not my people I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not beloved ‘beloved’;
</br>26 and in the place where it was said to them, ‘YOU are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”
<p></p>
</br>27 Moreover, Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Although the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved.
</br>28 For Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.”
</br>29 Also, just as Isaiah had said aforetime: “Unless Jehovah of armies had left a seed to us, we should have become just like Sod´om, and we should have been made just like Go·mor´rah.”
<p></p>
</br>30 What shall we say, then? That people of the nations, although not pursuing righteousness, caught up with righteousness, the righteousness that results from faith;
</br>31 but Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law.
</br>32 For what reason? Because he pursued it, not by faith, but as by works. They stumbled on the “stone of stumbling”;
</br>33 as it is written: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense, but he that rests his faith on it will not come to disappointment.”

</br>1 Brothers, the goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are, indeed, for their salvation.
</br>2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge;
</br>3 for, because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
</br>4 For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.
<p></p>
</br>5 For Moses writes that the man that has done the righteousness of the Law will live by it.
</br>6 But the righteousness resulting from faith speaks in this manner: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ that is, to bring Christ down;
</br>7 or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.”
</br>8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart”; that is, the “word” of faith, which we are preaching.
</br>9 For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your own mouth,’ that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved.
</br>10 For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.
<p></p>
</br>11 For the Scripture says: “None that rests his faith on him will be disappointed.”
</br>12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for there is the same Lord over all, who is rich to all those calling upon him.
</br>13 For “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”
</br>14 However, how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?
</br>15 How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent forth? Just as it is written: “How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!”
<p></p>
</br>16 Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says: “Jehovah, who put faith in the thing heard from us?”
</br>17 So faith follows the thing heard. In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ.
</br>18 Nevertheless I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, “into all the earth their sound went out, and to the extremities of the inhabited earth their utterances.”
</br>19 Nevertheless I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? First Moses says: “I will incite YOU people to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite YOU to violent anger through a stupid nation.”
</br>20 But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I became manifest to those who were not asking for me.”
</br>21 But as respects Israel he says: “All day long I have spread out my hands toward a people that is disobedient and talks back.”

</br>1 I ask, then, God did not reject his people, did he? Never may that happen! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
</br>2 God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. Why, do YOU not know what the Scripture says in connection with E·li´jah, as he pleads with God against Israel?
</br>3 “Jehovah, they have killed your prophets, they have dug up your altars, and I alone am left, and they are looking for my soul.”
</br>4 Yet, what does the divine pronouncement say to him? “I have left seven thousand men over for myself, [men] who have not bent the knee to Ba´al.”
</br>5 In this way, therefore, at the present season also a remnant has turned up according to a choosing due to undeserved kindness.
</br>6 Now if it is by undeserved kindness, it is no longer due to works; otherwise, the undeserved kindness no longer proves to be undeserved kindness.
<p></p>
</br>7 What, then? The very thing Israel is earnestly seeking he did not obtain, but the ones chosen obtained it. The rest had their sensibilities blunted;
</br>8 just as it is written: “God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes so as not to see and ears so as not to hear, down to this very day.”
</br>9 Also, David says: “Let their table become for them a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution;
</br>10 let their eyes become darkened so as not to see, and always bow down their back.”
<p></p>
</br>11 Therefore I ask, Did they stumble so that they fell completely? Never may that happen! But by their false step there is salvation to people of the nations, to incite them to jealousy.
</br>12 Now if their false step means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, how much more will the full number of them mean it!
<p></p>
</br>13 Now I speak to YOU who are people of the nations. Forasmuch as I am, in reality, an apostle to the nations, I glorify my ministry,
</br>14 if I may by any means incite [those who are] my own flesh to jealousy and save some from among them.
</br>15 For if the casting of them away means reconciliation for the world, what will the receiving of them mean but life from the dead?
</br>16 Further, if the [part taken as] firstfruits is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are also.
<p></p>
</br>17 However, if some of the branches were broken off but you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the olive’s root of fatness,
</br>18 do not be exulting over the branches. If, though, you are exulting over them, it is not you that bear the root, but the root [bears] you.
</br>19 You will say, then: “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.”
</br>20 All right! For [their] lack of faith they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Quit having lofty ideas, but be in fear.
</br>21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
</br>22 See, therefore, God’s kindness and severity. Toward those who fell there is severity, but toward you there is God’s kindness, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be lopped off.
</br>23 They also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
</br>24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree, how much rather will these who are natural be grafted into their own olive tree!
<p></p>
</br>25 For I do not want YOU, brothers, to be ignorant of this sacred secret, in order for YOU not to be discreet in your own eyes: that a dulling of sensibilities has happened in part to Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in,
</br>26 and in this manner all Israel will be saved. Just as it is written: “The deliverer will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob.
</br>27 And this is the covenant on my part with them, when I take their sins away.”
</br>28 True, with reference to the good news they are enemies for YOUR sakes, but with reference to [God’s] choosing they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
</br>29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret.
</br>30 For just as YOU were once disobedient to God but have now been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
</br>31 so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to YOU, that they themselves also may now be shown mercy.
</br>32 For God has shut them all up together in disobedience, that he might show all of them mercy.
<p></p>
</br>33 O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments [are] and past tracing out his ways [are]!
</br>34 For “who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?”
</br>35 Or, “Who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?”
</br>36 Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.

</br>3 For those ruling are an object of fear, not to the good deed, but to the bad. Do you, then, want to have no fear of the authority? Keep doing good, and you will have praise from it;
</br>4 for it is God’s minister to you for your good. But if you are doing what is bad, be in fear: for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword; for it is God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath upon the one practicing what is bad.

</br>13 Therefore let us not be judging one another any longer, but rather make this YOUR decision, not to put before a brother a stumbling block or a cause for tripping.
</br>14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiled in itself; only where a man considers something to be defiled, to him it is defiled.
</br>15 For if because of food your brother is being grieved, you are no longer walking in accord with love. Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died.
</br>16 Do not, therefore, let the good YOU people do be spoken of with injury to YOU.

</br>19 with the power of signs and portents, with the power of holy spirit; so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Il·lyr´i·cum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.
</br>20 In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where Christ had already been named, in order that I might not be building on another man’s foundation;
</br>21 but, just as it is written: “Those to whom no announcement has been made about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”

</br>22 Therefore also I was many times hindered from getting to YOU.
</br>23 But now that I no longer have [untouched] territory in these regions, and for some years having had a longing to get to YOU
</br>24 whenever I am on my way to Spain, I hope, above all, when I am on the journey there, to get a look at YOU and to be escorted partway there by YOU after I have first in some measure been satisfied with your company.

</br>26 For those in Mac·e·do´ni·a and A·cha´ia have been pleased to share up their things by a contribution to the poor of the holy ones in Jerusalem.
</br>27 True, they have been pleased to do so, and yet they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister publicly to these with things for the fleshly body.
</br>28 Hence after I have finished with this and have got this fruit securely to them, I shall depart by way of YOU for Spain.
</br>29 Moreover, I know that when I do come to YOU I shall come with a full measure of blessing from Christ.

</br>31 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Ju·de´a and that my ministry which is for Jerusalem may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones,

</br>19 For YOUR obedience has come to the notice of all. I therefore rejoice over YOU. But I want YOU to be wise as to what is good, but innocent as to what is evil.
</br>20 For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under YOUR feet shortly. May the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus be with YOU.
<p></p>
</br>21 Timothy my fellow worker greets YOU, and so do Lucius and Ja´son and So·sip´a·ter my relatives.
<p></p>
</br>22 I, Ter´tius, who have done the writing of this letter, greet YOU in [the] Lord.
<p></p>
</br>23 Ga´ius, my host and that of all the congregation, greets YOU. E·ras´tus the city steward greets YOU, and so does Quar´tus his brother.
</br>24 ——
<p></p>
</br>25 Now to him who can make YOU firm in accord with the good news I declare and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret which has been kept in silence for long-lasting times
</br>26 but has now been made manifest and has been made known through the prophetic scriptures among all the nations in accord with the command of the everlasting God to promote obedience by faith;
</br>27 to God, wise alone, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
