</br>1 The words of Ne·he·mi´ah the son of Hac·a·li´ah: Now it came about in the month Chis´lev, in the twentieth year, that I myself happened to be in Shu´shan the castle.
</br>2 Then Ha·na´ni, one of my brothers, came in, he and other men from Judah, and I proceeded to ask them about the Jews, those who had escaped, who had been left over of the captivity, and also about Jerusalem.
</br>3 Accordingly they said to me: “Those left over, who have been left over from the captivity, there in the jurisdictional district, are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its very gates have been burned with fire.”
<p></p>
</br>4 And it came about that, as soon as I heard these words, I sat down and began to weep and mourn for days, and I was continually fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.
</br>5 And I went on to say: “Ah, Jehovah the God of the heavens, the God great and fear-inspiring, keeping the covenant and loving-kindness toward those loving him and keeping his commandments,
</br>6 please, let your ear become attentive and your eyes opened, to listen to the prayer of your servant, which I am praying before you today, day and night, concerning the sons of Israel your servants, all the while making confession concerning the sins of the sons of Israel with which we have sinned against you. We have sinned, both I and the house of my father.
</br>7 We have unquestionably acted corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments and the regulations and the judicial decisions that you gave in command to Moses your servant.
<p></p>
</br>8 “Remember, please, the word that you commanded Moses your servant, saying, ‘Should YOU, for YOUR part, act unfaithfully, I, for my part, shall scatter YOU among the peoples.
</br>9 When YOU will have returned to me and kept my commandments and done them, though YOUR dispersed people should happen to be at the end of the heavens, from there I shall collect them and certainly bring them to the place that I have chosen to have my name reside there.’
</br>10 And they are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.
</br>11 Ah, Jehovah, please, let your ear become attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name; and, please, do grant success to your servant today and make him an object of pity before this man.”
<p></p>
Now I myself happened to be cupbearer to the king.

</br>1 And it came about in the month Ni´san, in the twentieth year of Ar·ta·xerx´es the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king. But never had I happened to be gloomy before him.
</br>2 So the king said to me: “Why is your face gloomy when you yourself are not sick? This is nothing but a gloominess of heart.” At this I became very much afraid.
<p></p>
</br>3 Then I said to the king: “Let the king himself live to time indefinite! Why should not my face become gloomy when the city, the house of the burial places of my forefathers, is devastated, and its very gates have been eaten up with fire?”
</br>4 In turn the king said to me: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” At once I prayed to the God of the heavens.
</br>5 After that I said to the king: “If to the king it does seem good, and if your servant seems good before you, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of the burial places of my forefathers, that I may rebuild it.”
</br>6 At this the king said to me, as his queenly consort was sitting beside him: “How long will your journey come to be and when will you return?” So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time.
<p></p>
</br>7 And I went on to say to the king: “If to the king it does seem good, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass until I come to Judah;
</br>8 also a letter to A´saph the keeper of the park that belongs to the king, that he may give me trees to build with timber the gates of the Castle that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city and for the house into which I am to enter.” So the king gave [them] to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
<p></p>
</br>9 Eventually I came to the governors beyond the River and gave them the letters of the king. Moreover, the king sent with me chiefs of the military force and horsemen.
</br>10 When San·bal´lat the Hor´o·nite and To·bi´ah the servant, the Am´mon·ite, got to hear [of it], then it seemed to them something very bad that a man had come to seek something good for the sons of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>11 At length I came to Jerusalem, and I continued there for three days.
</br>12 Then I rose up by night, I and a few men with me, and I did not tell a man what my God was putting into my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there was no domestic animal with me except the domestic animal on which I was riding.
</br>13 And I proceeded to go out by the Valley Gate by night and in front of the Fountain of the Big Snake and to the Gate of the Ash-heaps, and I was constantly examining the walls of Jerusalem, how they were broken down and the gates of it had been eaten up by fire.
</br>14 And I went passing along to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, and there was no place for the domestic animal under me to pass along.
</br>15 But I kept on ascending in the torrent valley by night, and I kept on examining the wall; after which I came back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so got back.
<p></p>
</br>16 And the deputy rulers themselves did not know where I had gone and what I was doing; and to the Jews and the priests and the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the doers of the work I had not yet told anything.
</br>17 Finally I said to them: “YOU are seeing the bad plight in which we are, how Jerusalem is devastated and its gates have been burned with fire. Come and let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer continue to be a reproach.”
</br>18 And I went on to tell them of the hand of my God, how it was good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had said to me. At this they said: “Let us get up, and we must build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
<p></p>
</br>19 Now when San·bal´lat the Hor´o·nite and To·bi´ah the servant, the Am´mon·ite, and Ge´shem the Arabian heard of it, they began to deride us and look on us despisingly and say: “What is this thing that YOU are doing? Is it against the king that YOU are rebelling?”
</br>20 However, I replied to them and said to them: “The God of the heavens is the One that will grant us success, and we ourselves, his servants, shall get up, and we must build; but YOU yourselves have no share, nor just claim, nor memorial in Jerusalem.”

</br>1 Now it came about that, as soon as San·bal´lat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and highly offended, and he kept deriding the Jews.
</br>2 And he began to say before his brothers and the military force of Sa·mar´i·a, yes, he began to say: “What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they depend upon themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they bring the stones to life out of the heaps of dusty rubbish when they are burned?”
<p></p>
</br>3 Now To·bi´ah the Am´mon·ite was alongside him, and he went on to say: “Even what they are building, if a fox went up [against it], he would certainly break down their wall of stones.”
<p></p>
</br>4 Hear, O our God, for we have become an object of contempt; and make their reproach return upon their own head, and give them to the plunder in the land of captivity.
</br>5 And do not cover over their error and their sin from before you. Let it not be wiped out, for they have committed offense against the builders.
<p></p>
</br>6 So we kept building the wall, and the entire wall came to be joined together clear to half its [height], and the people continued to have a heart for working.
<p></p>
</br>7 Now it came about that, as soon as San·bal´lat and To·bi´ah and the Arabians and the Am´mon·ites and the Ash´dod·ites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem had gone forward, for the gaps had started to be stopped up, they became very angry.
</br>8 And all of them began to conspire together to come and fight against Jerusalem and cause me disturbance.
</br>9 But we prayed to our God and kept a guard posted against them day and night on account of them.
<p></p>
</br>10 And Judah began to say: “The power of the burden bearer has stumbled, and there is a great deal of rubbish; and we ourselves are not able to build on the wall.”
<p></p>
</br>11 Moreover, our adversaries kept saying: “They will not know and they will not see until we come right in among them, and we shall certainly kill them and put a stop to the work.”
<p></p>
</br>12 And it came about that, whenever the Jews dwelling close by them came in, they proceeded to say to us ten times: “[They will come up] from all the places where YOU people will return to us.”
<p></p>
</br>13 So I kept [men] posted at the lowest parts of the place behind the wall at the open places, and I kept the people posted by families with their swords, their lances and their bows.
</br>14 When I saw [their fear] I immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid on their account. Jehovah the great and the fear-inspiring One keep in YOUR mind; and fight for YOUR brothers, YOUR sons and YOUR daughters, YOUR wives and YOUR homes.”
<p></p>
</br>15 Now it came about that as soon as our enemies heard that it had become known to us, so that the [true] God had frustrated their counsel and we had all of us gone back to the wall, each one to his work,
</br>16 yes, it came about that from that day forward half of my young men were active in the work and half of them were holding the lances, the shields and the bows and the coats of mail; and the princes were behind the whole house of Judah.
</br>17 As for the builders on the wall and those who were carrying the burden of load bearers, [each] one was active in the work with his one hand while the other [hand] was holding the missile.
</br>18 And the builders were girded, each one with his sword upon his hip, while building; and the one to blow the horn was alongside me.
<p></p>
</br>19 And I proceeded to say to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: “The work is large and extensive, and we are spread about upon the wall far apart from one another.
</br>20 In the place where YOU hear the sound of the horn, there is where YOU will collect yourselves together to us. Our God himself will fight for us.”
<p></p>
</br>21 While we were active in the work, the other half of them also were holding the lances, from the ascending of the dawn until the stars came out.
</br>22 Besides, at that time I said to the people: “Let the men spend the night, each one with his attendant, in the midst of Jerusalem, and they must become for us a guard by night and workers by day.”
</br>23 As for me and my brothers and my attendants and the men of the guard who were behind me, we were not taking off our garments, each one [having] his missile in his right hand.

</br>1 However, there came to be a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brothers.
</br>2 And there were those who were saying: “Our sons and our daughters we are giving as security that we may get grain and eat and keep alive.”
</br>3 And there were those who were saying: “Our fields and our vineyards and our houses we are giving as security that we may get grain during the food shortage.”
</br>4 And there were those who were saying: “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute on our fields and our vineyards.
</br>5 And now our flesh is the same as the flesh of our brothers; our sons are the same as their sons, but here we are reducing our sons and our daughters to slaves, and there are some of our daughters already reduced; and there is no power in our hands while our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Now I became very angry as soon as I heard their outcry and these words.
</br>7 So my heart took consideration within me, and I began finding fault with the nobles and the deputy rulers, and went on to say to them: “Usury is what YOU are exacting, each one from his own brother.”
<p></p>
Further, I arranged a great assembly on their account.
</br>8 And I proceeded to say to them: “We ourselves have bought back our own Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations, as far as it was in our power; and at the same time will YOU yourselves sell YOUR own brothers, and must they be sold to us?” At this they became speechless, and they did not find a word.
</br>9 And I went on to say: “The thing that YOU are doing is not good. Is it not in the fear of our God that YOU should walk because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
</br>10 And also I, my brothers and my attendants are giving money and grain on loan among them. Let us, please, leave off this lending on interest.
</br>11 Please, restore to them on this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and the hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil that YOU are exacting as interest from them.”
<p></p>
</br>12 To this they said: “We shall make restoration, and from them we shall ask nothing back. We shall do precisely as you are saying.” So I called the priests and made them swear to do according to this word.
</br>13 Also, my bosom I shook out and then said: “In this manner may the [true] God shake out from his house and from his acquired property every man that does not carry out this word; and in this manner may he become shaken out and empty.” To this all the congregation said: “Amen!” And they began to praise Jehovah. And the people proceeded to do according to this word.
<p></p>
</br>14 Another thing: From the day that he commissioned me to become their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Ar·ta·xerx´es the king, twelve years, I myself and my brothers did not eat the bread due the governor.
</br>15 As for the former governors that were prior to me, they had made it heavy upon the people, and they kept taking from them for bread and wine daily forty silver shekels. Also, their attendants themselves domineered over the people. As for me, I did not do that way on account of the fear of God.
<p></p>
</br>16 And, what is more, in the work of this wall I took a hand, and not a field did we acquire; and all my attendants were collected together there for the work.
</br>17 And the Jews and the deputy rulers, a hundred and fifty men, and those coming in to us from the nations that were around us were at my table.
</br>18 As for that which happened to be made ready daily, one bull, six select sheep and birds were made ready for me, and once every ten days every sort of wine in abundance. And along with this the bread due the governor I did not demand, because the service upon this people was heavy.
</br>19 Do remember for me, O my God, for good, all that I have done in behalf of this people.

</br>1 Now it came about that, as soon as it was told to San·bal´lat and To·bi´ah and to Ge´shem the Arabian and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and there had not been left in it a gap (although up to that time the doors themselves I had not set up in the gates),
</br>2 San·bal´lat and Ge´shem immediately sent to me, saying: “Do come, and let us meet together by appointment in the villages of the valley plain of O´no.” But they were scheming to do me harm.
</br>3 So I sent messengers to them, saying: “It is a great work that I am doing, and I am not able to go down. Why should the work cease while I take off from it and have to go down to YOU?”
</br>4 However, they sent me the same word four times, and I kept replying to them with the same word.
<p></p>
</br>5 Finally San·bal´lat sent his attendant to me with the same word a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
</br>6 There was written in it: “Among the nations it has been heard, and Ge´shem is saying [it], that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel. That is why you are building the wall; and you are becoming a king to them, according to these words.
</br>7 And there are even prophets that you have appointed to call out concerning you throughout Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ And now things like these will be told to the king. So now do come, and let us consult together.”
<p></p>
</br>8 However, I sent to him, saying: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.”
</br>9 For all of them were trying to make us afraid, saying: “Their hands will drop down from the work so that it will not be done.” But now strengthen my hands.
<p></p>
</br>10 And I myself entered the house of She·mai´ah the son of De·la´iah the son of Me·het´a·bel while he was shut up. And he proceeded to say: “Let us meet by appointment at the house of the [true] God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming in to kill you, even by night they are coming in to kill you.”
</br>11 But I said: “Should a man like me run away? And who is there like me that could enter into the temple and live? I shall not enter!”
</br>12 So I investigated, and here it was not God that had sent him, but he had spoken this prophecy against me as To·bi´ah and San·bal´lat themselves had hired him.
</br>13 For this reason he had been hired in order that I might be afraid and do that way, and I should certainly sin and it should certainly become in their possession a bad reputation, in order that they might reproach me.
<p></p>
</br>14 Do remember, O my God, To·bi´ah and San·bal´lat, according to these deeds of [each] one, and also No·a·di´ah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets that were continually trying to make me afraid.
<p></p>
</br>15 At length the wall came to completion on the twenty-fifth [day] of E´lul, in fifty-two days.
<p></p>
</br>16 And it came about that, as soon as all our enemies heard [of it] and all the nations that were around us got to see it, they at once fell very much in their own eyes, and they got to know that it was from our God that this work had been done.
</br>17 In those days also the nobles of Judah were making numerous their letters that were going to To·bi´ah and those of To·bi´ah that were coming in to them.
</br>18 For many in Judah were sworn to him, for a son-in-law he was to Shec·a·ni´ah the son of A´rah; and Je·ho·ha´nan his son had himself taken the daughter of Me·shul´lam the son of Ber·e·chi´ah.
</br>19 Also, good things about him they were continually saying before me. And my own words they were continually taking out to him. There were letters that To·bi´ah sent to make me afraid.

</br>1 And it came about that, as soon as the wall had been rebuilt, I at once set up the doors. Then there were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites.
</br>2 And I went on to put in command of Jerusalem Ha·na´ni my brother and Han·a·ni´ah the prince of the Castle, for he was such a trustworthy man and feared the [true] God more than many others.
</br>3 So I said to them: “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun gets hot; and while they are standing by they should shut the doors and bolt [them]. And station guards of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one at his own guardpost and each one in front of his own house.”
</br>4 Now the city was wide and great, and there were few people inside it, and there were no houses built.
<p></p>
</br>5 But my God put [it] into my heart that I should collect together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to get themselves enrolled genealogically. Then I found the book of genealogical enrollment of those who came up at the first, and found written in it:

</br>61 And these were the ones going up from Tel-me´lah, Tel-har´sha, Che´rub, Ad´don and Im´mer, and they were not able to tell the house of their fathers and their origin, whether they were of Israel:

</br>64 These were the ones that looked for their register, to establish their genealogy publicly, and it was not found, so that they were barred as polluted from the priesthood.
</br>65 Consequently the Tir·sha´tha said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until the priest with U´rim and Thum´mim stood up.
<p></p>
</br>66 The entire congregation as one group was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,

</br>70 And there was a part of the heads of the paternal houses that gave to the work. The Tir·sha´tha himself gave to the treasure a thousand gold drachmas, fifty bowls, five hundred and thirty priests’ robes.

<p></p>
</br>73 And the priests and the Levites and the gatekeepers and the singers and some of the people and the Neth´i·nim and all Israel took up dwelling in their cities. When the seventh month arrived, the sons of Israel were then in their cities.

<p></p>
</br>1 And all the people proceeded to gather themselves as one man at the public square that was before the Water Gate. Then they said to Ez´ra the copyist to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel.
</br>2 Accordingly Ez´ra the priest brought the law before the congregation of men as well as of women and of all intelligent enough to listen, on the first day of the seventh month.
</br>3 And he continued to read aloud from it before the public square that is before the Water Gate, from daybreak till midday, in front of the men and the women and the other intelligent ones; and the ears of all the people were [attentive] to the book of the law.
</br>4 And Ez´ra the copyist kept standing upon a wooden podium, which they had made for the occasion; and there were standing alongside him Mat·ti·thi´ah and She´ma and A·nai´ah and U·ri´ah and Hil·ki´ah and Ma·a·sei´ah to his right hand, and at his left Pe·dai´ah and Mish´a·el and Mal·chi´jah and Ha´shum and Hash-bad´da·nah, Zech·a·ri´ah [and] Me·shul´lam.
<p></p>
</br>5 And Ez´ra proceeded to open the book before the eyes of all the people, for he happened to be above all the people; and as he opened it all the people stood up.
</br>6 Then Ez´ra blessed Jehovah the [true] God, the great One, at which all the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” with the lifting up of their hands. They then bowed low and prostrated themselves to Jehovah with [their] faces to the earth.
</br>7 And Jesh´u·a and Ba´ni and She·re·bi´ah, Ja´min, Ak´kub, Shab´be·thai, Ho·di´ah, Ma·a·sei´ah, Ke·li´ta, Az·a·ri´ah, Jo´za·bad, Ha´nan, Pe·la´iah, even the Levites, were explaining the law to the people, while the people were in a standing position.
</br>8 And they continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the [true] God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning [into it]; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.
<p></p>
</br>9 And Ne·he·mi´ah, that is, the Tir·sha´tha, and Ez´ra the priest, the copyist, and the Levites who were instructing the people proceeded to say to all the people: “This very day is holy to Jehovah YOUR God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping as they were hearing the words of the law.
</br>10 And he went on to say to them: “Go, eat the fatty things and drink the sweet things, and send portions to the one for whom nothing has been prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is YOUR stronghold.”
</br>11 And the Levites were ordering all the people to be silent, saying: “Keep quiet! for this day is holy; and do not feel hurt.”
</br>12 So all the people went away to eat and drink and to send out portions and to carry on a great rejoicing, for they had understood the words that had been made known to them.
<p></p>
</br>13 And on the second day the heads of the fathers of all the people, the priests and the Levites, gathered themselves together to Ez´ra the copyist, even to gain insight into the words of the law.
</br>14 Then they found written in the law that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses that the sons of Israel should dwell in booths during the festival in the seventh month,
</br>15 and that they should make proclamation and cause a call to pass throughout all their cities and throughout Jerusalem, saying: “Go out to the mountainous region and bring in olive leaves and the leaves of oil trees and myrtle leaves and palm leaves and the leaves of branchy trees to make booths, according to what is written.”
<p></p>
</br>16 And the people proceeded to go out and bring [them] in and make booths for themselves, each one upon his own roof and in their courtyards and in the courtyards of the house of the [true] God and in the public square of the Water Gate and in the public square of the Gate of E´phra·im.
</br>17 Thus all the congregation of those who had come back from the captivity made booths and took up dwelling in the booths; for the sons of Israel had not done that way from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day, so that there came to be very great rejoicing.
</br>18 And there was a reading aloud of the book of the law of the [true] God day by day, from the first day until the last day; and they went on holding the festival seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.

</br>1 And on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel gathered themselves together with fasting and with sackcloth and dirt upon themselves.
</br>2 And the seed of Israel proceeded to separate themselves from all the foreigners, and to stand and make confession of their own sins and the errors of their fathers.
</br>3 Then they rose up at their place and they read aloud from the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and a fourth part they were making confession and bowing down to Jehovah their God.
<p></p>
</br>4 And Jesh´u·a and Ba´ni, Kad´mi·el, Sheb·a·ni´ah, Bun´ni, She·re·bi´ah, Ba´ni [and] Che·na´ni proceeded to rise on the platform of the Levites and cry out with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.
</br>5 And the Levites Jesh´u·a and Kad´mi·el, Ba´ni, Hash·ab·nei´ah, She·re·bi´ah, Ho·di´ah, Sheb·a·ni´ah [and] Peth·a·hi´ah went on to say: “Rise, bless Jehovah YOUR God from time indefinite to time indefinite. And let them bless your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
<p></p>
</br>6 “You are Jehovah alone; you yourself have made the heavens, [even] the heaven of the heavens, and all their army, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them; and you are preserving all of them alive; and the army of the heavens are bowing down to you.
</br>7 You are Jehovah the [true] God, who chose A´bram and brought him out of Ur of the Chal·de´ans and constituted his name Abraham.
</br>8 And you found his heart faithful before you; so there was a contracting of the covenant with him to give [him] the land of the Ca´naan·ites, the Hit´tites, the Am´or·ites and the Per´iz·zites and the Jeb´u·sites and the Gir´ga·shites, to give [it] to his seed; and you proceeded to carry out your words, because you are righteous.
<p></p>
</br>9 “So you saw the affliction of our forefathers in Egypt, and their outcry at the Red Sea you heard.
</br>10 Then you gave signs and miracles against Phar´aoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted presumptuously against them; and you proceeded to make a name for yourself as at this day.
</br>11 And the sea you split before them, so that they crossed over through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers you hurled into the depths like a stone in the strong waters.
</br>12 And by a pillar of cloud you led them by day, and by a pillar of fire by night, to light up for them the way in which they should go.
</br>13 And upon Mount Si´nai you came down and spoke with them out of heaven and went on to give them upright judicial decisions and laws of truth, good regulations and commandments.
</br>14 And your holy sabbath you made known to them, and commandments and regulations and a law you commanded them by means of Moses your servant.
</br>15 And bread from heaven you gave them for their hunger, and waters out of the crag you brought forth to them for their thirst, and you went on to say to them to enter and possess the land that you had lifted your hand [in an oath] to give to them.
<p></p>
</br>16 “And they themselves, even our forefathers, acted presumptuously and proceeded to harden their neck, and they did not listen to your commandments.
</br>17 So they refused to listen, and they did not remember your wonderful acts that you performed with them, but they hardened their neck and appointed a head to return to their servitude in Egypt. But you are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, and you did not leave them.
</br>18 Yes, when they had made for themselves a molten statue of a calf and began to say, ‘This is your God who led you up out of Egypt,’ and they went on to commit great acts of disrespect,
</br>19 you, even you, in your abundant mercy did not leave them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud itself did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way in which they should go.
</br>20 And your good spirit you gave to make them prudent, and your manna you did not hold back from their mouth, and water you gave them for their thirst.
</br>21 And for forty years you provided them with food in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.
<p></p>
</br>22 “And you proceeded to give them kingdoms and peoples, and to apportion them piece by piece; so that they took possession of the land of Si´hon, even the land of the king of Hesh´bon, and the land of Og the king of Ba´shan.
</br>23 And their sons you made as many as the stars of the heavens. Then you brought them into the land that you had promised to their forefathers that [they] should enter to take possession.
</br>24 So their sons came in and took the land in possession, and you proceeded to subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Ca´naan·ites, and to give them into their hand, even their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their liking.
</br>25 And they went capturing fortified cities and a fat soil and taking in possession houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards and olive groves and trees for food in abundance, and they began to eat and to be satisfied and to grow fat and to luxuriate in your great goodness.
<p></p>
</br>26 “However, they became disobedient and rebelled against you and kept casting your law behind their back, and your own prophets they killed, who bore witness against them to bring them back to you; and they went on committing acts of great disrespect.
</br>27 For this you gave them into the hand of their adversaries, who kept causing them distress; but in the time of their distress they would cry out to you, and you yourself would hear from the very heavens; and in accord with your abundant mercy you would give them saviors who would save them out of the hand of their adversaries.
<p></p>
</br>28 “But as soon as they were at rest, they would again do what is bad before you, and you would leave them to the hand of their enemies, who would tread them down. Then they would return and call to you for aid, and you yourself would hear from the very heavens and deliver them in accord with your abundant mercy, time and again.
</br>29 Although you would bear witness against them to bring them back to your law, they themselves even acted presumptuously and did not listen to your commandments; and against your own judicial decisions they sinned, which, if a man will do, he must also live by means of them. And they kept giving a stubborn shoulder, and their neck they hardened, and they did not listen.
</br>30 But you were indulgent with them for many years and kept bearing witness against them by your spirit by means of your prophets, and they did not give ear. Finally you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
</br>31 And in your abundant mercy you did not make an extermination of them or leave them; for you are a God gracious and merciful.
<p></p>
</br>32 “And now, O our God, the God great, mighty and fear-inspiring, keeping the covenant and loving-kindness, do not let all the hardship that has found us, our kings, our princes and our priests and our prophets and our forefathers and all your people from the days of the kings of As·syr´i·a down to this day, seem little before you.
</br>33 And you are righteous as regards all that has come upon us, for faithfully is how you have acted, but we are the ones that have done wickedly.
</br>34 As for our kings, our princes, our priests and our forefathers, they have not performed your law, nor paid attention to your commandments or to your testimonies with which you bore witness against them.
</br>35 And they themselves—during their kingdom and amid your abundant good things that you gave to them and in the broad and fat land that you made available for them, they did not serve you and did not turn back from their bad practices.
</br>36 Look! We are today slaves; and as for the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things, look! we are slaves upon it,
</br>37 and its produce is abounding for the kings that you have put over us because of our sins, and over our bodies they are ruling and over our domestic animals, according to their liking, and we are in great distress.

<p></p>
</br>31 And the sons of Benjamin were from Ge´ba, Mich´mash and Ai´ja and Beth´el and its dependent towns,
</br>32 An´a·thoth, Nob, A·na·ni´ah,

<p></p>
</br>1 And these were the priests and the Levites that went up with Ze·rub´ba·bel the son of She·al´ti·el and Jesh´u·a: Se·rai´ah, Jeremiah, Ez´ra,
</br>2 Am·a·ri´ah, Mal´luch, Hat´tush,
</br>3 Shec·a·ni´ah, Re´hum, Mer´e·moth,
</br>4 Id´do, Gin´ne·thoi, A·bi´jah,
</br>5 Mij´a·min, Ma·a·di´ah, Bil´gah,
</br>6 She·mai´ah, and Joi´a·rib, Je·da´iah,
</br>7 Sal´lu, A´mok, Hil·ki´ah, Je·da´iah. These were the heads of the priests and their brothers in the days of Jesh´u·a.
<p></p>
</br>8 And the Levites were Jesh´u·a, Bin´nu·i, Kad´mi·el, She·re·bi´ah, Judah, Mat·ta·ni´ah, over the giving of thanks, he and his brothers.
</br>9 And Bak·bu·ki´ah and Un´ni their brothers were opposite them for guard duties.
</br>10 Jesh´u·a himself became father to Joi´a·kim, and Joi´a·kim himself became father to E·li´a·shib, and E·li´a·shib to Joi´a·da.
</br>11 And Joi´a·da himself became father to Jon´a·than, and Jon´a·than himself became father to Jad´du·a.
<p></p>
</br>12 And in the days of Joi´a·kim there happened to be priests, the heads of the paternal houses: for Se·rai´ah, Me·rai´ah; for Jeremiah, Han·a·ni´ah;
</br>13 for Ez´ra, Me·shul´lam; for Am·a·ri´ah, Je·ho·ha´nan;
</br>14 for Mal´lu·chi, Jon´a·than; for Sheb·a·ni´ah, Joseph;
</br>15 for Ha´rim, Ad´na; for Me·ra´ioth, Hel´kai;
</br>16 for Id´do, Zech·a·ri´ah; for Gin´ne·thon, Me·shul´lam;
</br>17 for A·bi´jah, Zich´ri; for Mi·ni´a·min, ——; for Mo·a·di´ah, Pil´tai;
</br>18 for Bil´gah, Sham·mu´a; for She·mai´ah, Je·hon´a·than;
</br>19 and for Joi´a·rib, Mat·te´nai; for Je·da´iah, Uz´zi;
</br>20 for Sal·la´i, Kal´lai; for A´mok, E´ber;
</br>21 for Hil·ki´ah, Hash·a·bi´ah; for Je·da´iah, Ne·than´el.
<p></p>
</br>22 The Levites in the days of E·li´a·shib, Joi´a·da and Jo·ha´nan and Jad´du·a were recorded as heads of paternal houses, also the priests, down till the kingship of Da·ri´us the Persian.
<p></p>
</br>23 The sons of Le´vi as heads of the paternal houses were recorded in the book of the affairs of the times, even down till the days of Jo·ha´nan the son of E·li´a·shib.
</br>24 And the heads of the Levites were Hash·a·bi´ah, She·re·bi´ah and Jesh´u·a the son of Kad´mi·el and their brothers opposite them to offer praise [and] give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of the [true] God, guard group corresponding with guard group.
</br>25 Mat·ta·ni´ah and Bak·bu·ki´ah, O·ba·di´ah, Me·shul´lam, Tal´mon, Ak´kub were keeping guard as gatekeepers, a guard group by the stores of the gates.
</br>26 These were in the days of Joi´a·kim the son of Jesh´u·a the son of Jo´za·dak and in the days of Ne·he·mi´ah the governor and Ez´ra the priest, the copyist.
<p></p>
</br>27 And at the inauguration of the wall of Jerusalem they looked for the Levites, to bring them out of all their places to Jerusalem to carry on an inauguration and a rejoicing even with thanksgivings and with song, cymbals [and] stringed instruments and with harps.
</br>28 And the sons of the singers proceeded to gather themselves even from the District, from all around Jerusalem and from the settlements of the Ne·toph´a·thites,
</br>29 and from Beth-gil´gal and from the fields of Ge´ba and Az´ma·veth, for there were settlements that the singers had built for themselves all around Jerusalem.
</br>30 And the priests and the Levites proceeded to cleanse themselves and cleanse the people and the gates and the wall.
<p></p>
</br>31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall. Further, I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions, [and the one was walking] to the right upon the wall to the Gate of the Ash-heaps.
</br>32 And Ho·shai´ah and half of the princes of Judah began to walk behind them,
</br>33 also Az·a·ri´ah, Ez´ra and Me·shul´lam,
</br>34 Judah and Benjamin and She·mai´ah and Jeremiah;
</br>35 also of the sons of the priests with the trumpets Zech·a·ri´ah the son of Jon´a·than the son of She·mai´ah the son of Mat·ta·ni´ah the son of Mi·cai´ah the son of Zac´cur the son of A´saph,
</br>36 and his brothers She·mai´ah and Az´ar·el, Mil´a·lai, Gil´a·lai, Ma´ai, Ne·than´el and Judah, Ha·na´ni, with the instruments of song of David the man of the [true] God; and Ez´ra the copyist before them.
</br>37 And at the Fountain Gate and straight ahead of them they went up on the Stairway of the City of David by the ascent of the wall above the House of David and clear to the Water Gate to the east.
<p></p>
</br>38 And the other thanksgiving choir was walking in front, and I after it, also half of the people, upon the wall up over the Tower of the Bake Ovens and on to the Broad Wall,
</br>39 and up over the Gate of E´phra·im and on to the Gate of the Old [City] and clear to the Fish Gate and the Tower of Ha·nan´el and the Tower of Me´ah and on to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a stand at the Gate of the Guard.
<p></p>
</br>40 At length the two thanksgiving choirs came to a stand at the house of the [true] God, also I and half of the deputy rulers with me,
</br>41 and the priests E·li´a·kim, Ma·a·sei´ah, Mi·ni´a·min, Mi·cai´ah, Eli·o·e´nai, Zech·a·ri´ah, Han·a·ni´ah with the trumpets,
</br>42 and Ma·a·sei´ah and She·mai´ah, and El·e·a´zar and Uz´zi and Je·ho·ha´nan and Mal·chi´jah and E´lam and E´zer. And the singers with Iz·ra·hi´ah the overseer kept making themselves heard.
<p></p>
</br>43 And they proceeded to sacrifice on that day great sacrifices and to rejoice, for the [true] God himself caused them to rejoice with great joy. And also the women and the children themselves rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.
<p></p>
</br>44 Further, there were appointed on that day men over the halls for the stores, for the contributions, for the firstfruits and for the tenths, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions [called for by] the law for the priests and the Levites; for the rejoicing of Judah was because of the priests and of the Levites who were in attendance.
</br>45 And they began taking care of the obligation of their God and the obligation of the purification, also the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David [and] Sol´o·mon his son.
</br>46 For in the days of David and A´saph in bygone time there were heads of the singers and the song of praise and thanksgivings to God.
</br>47 And all Israel during the days of Ze·rub´ba·bel and during the days of Ne·he·mi´ah were giving the portions of the singers and of the gatekeepers according to the daily need and were sanctifying [them] to the Levites; and the Levites were sanctifying [them] to the sons of Aaron.
@@libNehemiah 
</br>13 :
</br>1 -
</br>31 
<p></p>
</br>1 On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and there was found written in it that the Am´mon·ite and the Mo´ab·ite should not come into the congregation of the [true] God to time indefinite,
</br>2 for they had not met the sons of Israel with bread and with water, but went hiring against them Ba´laam to call down evil upon them. However, our God changed the malediction into a benediction.
</br>3 So it came about that, as soon as they heard the law, they began to separate all the mixed company from Israel.
<p></p>
</br>4 Now before this, E·li´a·shib the priest in charge of a dining hall of the house of our God was a relative of To·bi´ah;
</br>5 and he proceeded to make for him a large dining hall, where previously they were regularly putting the grain offering, the frankincense and the utensils and the tenth of the grain, the new wine and the oil, to which the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers are entitled, and the contribution for the priests.
<p></p>
</br>6 And during all this [time] I did not happen to be in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Ar·ta·xerx´es the king of Babylon I came to the king, and sometime later I asked leave of absence from the king.
</br>7 Then I came to Jerusalem and got to notice the badness that E·li´a·shib had committed for To·bi´ah by making for him a hall in the courtyard of the house of the [true] God.
</br>8 And it seemed very bad to me. So I threw all the furniture of To·bi´ah’s house outside the dining hall.
</br>9 After that I said [the word] and they cleansed the dining halls; and I proceeded to put back there the utensils of the house of the [true] God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
<p></p>
</br>10 And I got to find out that the very portions of the Levites had not been given [them], so that the Levites and the singers doing the work went running off, each one to his own field.
</br>11 And I began to find fault with the deputy rulers and say: “Why has the house of the [true] God been neglected?” Consequently I collected them together and stationed them at their standing place.
</br>12 And all Judah, for their part, brought in the tenth of the grain and of the new wine and of the oil to the stores.
</br>13 Then I put Shel·e·mi´ah the priest and Za´dok the copyist and Pe·dai´ah of the Levites in charge of the stores; and under their control there was Ha´nan the son of Zac´cur the son of Mat·ta·ni´ah, for they were considered faithful; and upon them it devolved to do the distributing to their brothers.
<p></p>
</br>14 Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.
<p></p>
</br>15 In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the sabbath and bringing in grain heaps and loading [them] upon asses, and also wine, grapes and figs and every sort of burden, and bringing [them] into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I proceeded to bear witness [against them] on the day of their selling provisions.
</br>16 And the Tyr´i·ans themselves dwelt in [the city], bringing in fish and every sort of merchandise and making sales on the sabbath to the sons of Judah and in Jerusalem.
</br>17 So I began to find fault with the nobles of Judah and say to them: “What is this bad thing that YOU are doing, even profaning the sabbath day?
</br>18 Was it not this way that YOUR forefathers did, so that our God brought upon us all this calamity, and also upon this city? Yet YOU are adding to the burning anger against Israel by profaning the sabbath.”
<p></p>
</br>19 And it came about that, as soon as the gates of Jerusalem had grown shadowy before the sabbath, I immediately said [the word] and the doors began to be closed. I said further that they should not open them until after the sabbath; and some of my own attendants I stationed at the gates that no burden might come in on the sabbath day.
</br>20 Consequently the traders and the sellers of every sort of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once and a second time.
</br>21 Then I proceeded to bear witness against them and say to them: “Why are YOU spending the night in front of the wall? If YOU do it again, a hand I shall lay on YOU.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.
<p></p>
</br>22 And I went on to say to the Levites that they should be regularly purifying themselves and coming in, keeping guard of the gates to sanctify the sabbath day. This, also, do remember to my account, O my God, and do feel sorry for me according to the abundance of your loving-kindness.
<p></p>
</br>23 Also, in those days I saw the Jews that had given a dwelling to Ash´dod·ite, Am´mon·ite [and] Mo´ab·ite wives.
</br>24 And as for their sons, half were speaking Ash´dod·ite, and there were none of them knowing how to speak Jewish, but in the tongue of the different peoples.
</br>25 And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: “YOU should not give YOUR daughters to their sons, and YOU should not accept any of their daughters for YOUR sons or yourselves.
</br>26 Was it not because of these that Sol´o·mon the king of Israel sinned? And among the many nations there proved to be no king like him; and loved of his God he happened to be, so that God constituted him king over all Israel. Even him the foreign wives caused to sin.
</br>27 And is it not something unheard of for YOU to commit all this great badness in acting unfaithfully against our God by giving a dwelling to foreign wives?”
<p></p>
</br>28 And one of the sons of Joi´a·da the son of E·li´a·shib the high priest was a son-in-law of San·bal´lat the Hor´o·nite. So I chased him away from me.
<p></p>
</br>29 Do remember them, O my God, on account of the defilement of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
<p></p>
</br>30 And I purified them from everything foreign and proceeded to assign duties to the priests and to the Levites, each one in his own work,
</br>31 even for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits.
<p></p>
Do remember me, O my God, for good.
