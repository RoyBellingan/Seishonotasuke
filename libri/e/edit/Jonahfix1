</br>1 And the word of Jehovah began to occur to Jo´nah the son of A·mit´tai, saying:
</br>2 “Get up, go to Nin´e·veh the great city, and proclaim against her that their badness has come up before me.”
<p></p>
</br>3 And Jo´nah proceeded to get up and run away to Tar´shish from before Jehovah; and he finally came down to Jop´pa and found a ship going to Tar´shish. So he paid its fare and went down into it, in order to go with them to Tar´shish from before Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>4 And Jehovah himself hurled forth a great wind at the sea, and there came to be a great tempest on the sea; and as for the ship, it was about to be wrecked.
</br>5 And the mariners began to fear and to call for aid, each one to his god. And they kept hurling out the articles that were in the ship to the sea, in order to lighten [it] of them. But Jo´nah himself had gone down to the innermost parts of the decked vessel, and he proceeded to lie down and go fast asleep.
</br>6 At length the ship captain came near to him and said to him: “What is the matter with you, sleeper? Get up, call out to your god! Perhaps the [true] God will show himself caring about us, and we shall not perish.”
<p></p>
</br>7 And they began to say to one another: “Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account we have this calamity.” And they kept casting lots, and finally the lot fell upon Jo´nah.
</br>8 So they said to him: “Do tell us, please, on whose account it is that we are having this calamity? What is your work, and from where do you come? What is your country, and from which people are you?”
<p></p>
</br>9 At that he said to them: “I am a Hebrew, and Jehovah the God of the heavens I am fearing, the One who made the sea and the dry land.”
<p></p>
</br>10 And the men began to fear greatly, and they went on to say to him: “What is this that you have done?” For the men had come to know that it was from before Jehovah that he was running away, because he had told them.
</br>11 Finally they said to him: “What should we do to you, in order that the sea may become still for us?” For the sea was continually growing more tempestuous.
</br>12 So he said to them: “Lift me up and hurl me into the sea, and the sea will become still for YOU; because I am aware that it is on my account that this great tempest is upon YOU.”
</br>13 But the men tried to work their way through, in order to bring [the ship] back to the dry land; yet they were unable, because the sea was continually growing more tempestuous against them.
<p></p>
</br>14 And they proceeded to call out to Jehovah and to say: “Ah, now, O Jehovah, may we, please, not perish because of the soul of this man! And do not put upon us innocent blood, since you yourself, O Jehovah, have done according to what you have delighted in!”
</br>15 Then they lifted up Jo´nah and hurled him into the sea; and the sea began to halt from its raging.
</br>16 At that the men began to fear Jehovah greatly, and so they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah and made vows.
<p></p>
</br>17 Now Jehovah appointed a great fish to swallow Jo´nah, so that Jo´nah came to be in the inward parts of the fish three days and three nights.

</br>1 Then Jo´nah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish
</br>2 and said:

<p></p>
</br>10 In time Jehovah commanded the fish, so that it vomited out Jo´nah onto the dry land.

</br>1 Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jo´nah the second time, saying:
</br>2 “Get up, go to Nin´e·veh the great city, and proclaim to her the proclamation that I am speaking to you.”
<p></p>
</br>3 At that, Jo´nah got up and went to Nin´e·veh in accord with the word of Jehovah. Now Nin´e·veh herself proved to be a city great to God, with a walking distance of three days.
</br>4 Finally Jo´nah started to enter into the city the walking distance of one day, and he kept proclaiming and saying: “Only forty days more, and Nin´e·veh will be overthrown.”
<p></p>
</br>5 And the men of Nin´e·veh began to put faith in God, and they proceeded to proclaim a fast and to put on sackcloth, from the greatest one of them even to the least one of them.
</br>6 When the word reached the king of Nin´e·veh, then he rose up from his throne and put off his official garment from himself and covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the ashes.
</br>7 Furthermore, he had the cry made, and he had it said in Nin´e·veh, by the decree of the king and his great ones, saying:
<p></p>
“No man and no domestic animal, no herd and no flock, should taste anything at all. None should take food. Even water they should not drink.
</br>8 And let them cover themselves with sackcloth, man and domestic animal; and let them call out to God with strength and come back, each one from his bad way and from the violence that was in their hands.
</br>9 Who is there knowing whether the [true] God may turn back and actually feel regret and turn back from his burning anger, so that we may not perish?”
<p></p>
</br>10 And the [true] God got to see their works, that they had turned back from their bad way; and so the [true] God felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of causing to them; and he did not cause [it].

</br>1 To Jo´nah, though, it was highly displeasing, and he got to be hot with anger.
</br>2 Hence he prayed to Jehovah and said: “Ah, now, O Jehovah, was not this an affair of mine, while I happened to be on my own ground? That is why I went ahead and ran away to Tar´shish; for I knew that you are a God gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, and feeling regret over the calamity.
</br>3 And now, O Jehovah, take away, please, my soul from me, for my dying is better than my being alive.”
<p></p>
</br>4 In turn Jehovah said: “Have you rightly become hot with anger?”
<p></p>
</br>5 Then Jo´nah went out of the city and sat down east of the city; and gradually he made for himself there a booth, that he might sit under it in the shade until he would see what would become of the city.
</br>6 Accordingly Jehovah God appointed a bottle-gourd plant, that it should come up over Jo´nah, in order to become a shade over his head, to deliver him from his calamitous state. And Jo´nah began to rejoice greatly over the bottle-gourd plant.
<p></p>
</br>7 But the [true] God appointed a worm at the ascending of the dawn on the next day, that it should strike the bottle-gourd plant; and it gradually dried up.
</br>8 And it came about that, as soon as the sun shone forth, God also went on to appoint a parching east wind, and the sun kept striking upon the head of Jo´nah, so that he was swooning away; and he kept asking that his soul might die, and he repeatedly said: “My dying off is better than my being alive.”
<p></p>
</br>9 And God proceeded to say to Jo´nah: “Have you rightly become hot with anger over the bottle-gourd plant?”
<p></p>
At that he said: “I have rightly become hot with anger, to the point of death.”
</br>10 But Jehovah said: “You, for your part, felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, which you did not toil upon or make get big, which proved to be a mere growth of a night and perished as a mere growth of a night.
</br>11 And, for my part, ought I not to feel sorry for Nin´e·veh the great city, in which there exist more than one hundred and twenty thousand men who do not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left, besides many domestic animals?”
