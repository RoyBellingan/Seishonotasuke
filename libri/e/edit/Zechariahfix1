</br>1 In the eighth month in the second year of Da·ri´us the word of Jehovah occurred to Zech·a·ri´ah the son of Ber·e·chi´ah the son of Id´do the prophet, saying:
</br>2 “Jehovah grew indignant at YOUR fathers—very much so.
<p></p>
</br>3 “And you must say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “‘Return to me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘and I shall return to YOU,’ Jehovah of armies has said.”’
<p></p>
</br>4 “‘Do not become like YOUR fathers to whom the former prophets called, saying: “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Return, please, from YOUR bad ways and from YOUR bad dealings.’”’
<p></p>
“‘But they did not listen, and they paid no attention to me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>5 “‘As for YOUR fathers, where are they? And as for the prophets, was it to time indefinite that they continued to live?
</br>6 However, as regards my words and my regulations that I commanded my servants, the prophets, did they not catch up with YOUR fathers?’ So they returned and said: ‘According to what Jehovah of armies had in mind to do to us, according to our ways and according to our dealings, that is how he has done with us.’”
<p></p>
</br>7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, that is, the month She´bat, in the second year of Da·ri´us, the word of Jehovah occurred to Zech·a·ri´ah the son of Ber·e·chi´ah the son of Id´do the prophet, saying:
</br>8 “I saw [in] the night, and, look! a man riding on a red horse, and he was standing still among the myrtle trees that were in the deep place; and behind him there were horses red, bright red, and white.”
<p></p>
</br>9 And so I said: “Who are these, my lord?”
<p></p>
At that the angel who was speaking with me said to me: “I myself shall show you who these very ones are.”
<p></p>
</br>10 Then the man who was standing still among the myrtle trees answered and said: “These are the ones whom Jehovah has sent forth to walk about in the earth.”
</br>11 And they proceeded to answer the angel of Jehovah who was standing among the myrtle trees and to say: “We have walked about in the earth, and, look! the whole earth is sitting still and having no disturbance.”
<p></p>
</br>12 So the angel of Jehovah answered and said: “O Jehovah of armies, how long will you yourself not show mercy to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah, whom you have denounced these seventy years?”
<p></p>
</br>13 And Jehovah proceeded to answer the angel who was speaking with me, with good words, comforting words;
</br>14 and the angel who was speaking with me went on to say to me: “Call out, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy.
</br>15 With great indignation I am feeling indignant against the nations that are at ease; because I, for my part, felt indignant to only a little extent, but they, for their part, helped toward calamity.”’
<p></p>
</br>16 “Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘“I shall certainly return to Jerusalem with mercies. My own house will be built in her,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, “and a measuring line itself will be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’
<p></p>
</br>17 “Call out further, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “My cities will yet overflow with goodness; and Jehovah will yet certainly feel regrets over Zion and yet actually choose Jerusalem.”’”
<p></p>
</br>18 And I proceeded to raise my eyes and see; and, look! there were four horns.
</br>19 So I said to the angel who was speaking with me: “What are these?” In turn he said to me: “These are the horns that dispersed Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Furthermore, Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.
</br>21 At that I said: “What are these coming to do?”
<p></p>
And he went on to say: “These are the horns that dispersed Judah to such an extent that no one at all raised his head; and these others will come to set them trembling, to cast down the horns of the nations that are lifting up a horn against the land of Judah, in order to disperse her.”

</br>1 And I proceeded to raise my eyes and see; and, look! there was a man, and in his hand a measuring rope.
</br>2 So I said: “Where are you going?”
<p></p>
In turn he said to me: “To measure Jerusalem, in order to see what her breadth amounts to and what her length amounts to.”
<p></p>
</br>3 And, look! the angel who was speaking with me was going forth, and there was another angel going forth to meet him.
</br>4 Then he said to him: “Run, speak to the young man over there, saying, ‘“As open rural country Jerusalem will be inhabited, because of the multitude of men and domestic animals in the midst of her.
</br>5 And I myself shall become to her,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “a wall of fire all around, and a glory is what I shall become in the midst of her.”’”
<p></p>
</br>6 “Hey there! Hey there! Flee, then, YOU people, from the land of the north,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
<p></p>
“For in the direction of the four winds of the heavens I have spread YOU people abroad,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>7 “Hey there, Zion! Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.
</br>8 For this is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Following after [the] glory he has sent me to the nations that were despoiling YOU people; for he that is touching YOU is touching my eyeball.
</br>9 For here I am waving my hand against them, and they will have to become spoil to their slaves.’ And YOU people will certainly know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me.
<p></p>
</br>10 “Cry out loudly and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for here I am coming, and I will reside in the midst of you,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
</br>11 “And many nations will certainly become joined to Jehovah in that day, and they will actually become my people; and I will reside in the midst of you.” And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me to you.
</br>12 And Jehovah will certainly take possession of Judah as his portion upon the holy ground, and he must yet choose Jerusalem.

</br>1 And he proceeded to show me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand in order to resist him.
</br>2 Then [the angel of] Jehovah said to Satan: “Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan, yes, Jehovah rebuke you, he who is choosing Jerusalem! Is this one not a log snatched out of the fire?”
<p></p>
</br>3 Now as for Joshua, he happened to be clothed in befouled garments and standing before the angel.
</br>4 Then he answered and said to those standing before him: “Remove the befouled garments from upon him.” And he went on to say to him: “See, I have caused your error to pass away from upon you, and there is a clothing of you with robes of state.”
<p></p>
</br>5 At that I said: “Let them put a clean turban upon his head.” And they proceeded to put the clean turban upon his head and to clothe him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.
</br>6 And the angel of Jehovah began to bear witness to Joshua, saying:
</br>7 “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘If it is in my ways that you will walk, and if it is my obligation that you will keep, then also it will be you that will judge my house and also keep my courtyards; and I shall certainly give you free access among these who are standing by.’

</br>9 For, look! the stone that I have put before Joshua! Upon the one stone there are seven eyes. Here I am engraving its engraving,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘and I will take away the error of that land in one day.’

</br>2 Then he said to me: “What are you seeing?”
<p></p>
So I said: “I have seen, and, look! there is a lampstand, all of it of gold, with a bowl on top of it. And its seven lamps are upon it, even seven; and the lamps that are at the top of it have seven pipes.
</br>3 And there are two olive trees alongside it, one on the right side of the bowl and one on its left side.”
<p></p>
</br>4 Then I answered and said to the angel who was speaking with me, saying: “What do these [things] mean, my lord?”
</br>5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me: “Do you not really know what these things mean?”
<p></p>
In turn I said: “No, my lord.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Accordingly he answered and said to me: “This is the word of Jehovah to Ze·rub´ba·bel, saying, ‘“Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,” Jehovah of armies has said.
</br>7 Who are you, O great mountain? Before Ze·rub´ba·bel [you will become] a level land. And he will certainly bring forth the headstone. There will be shoutings to it: “How charming! How charming!”’”
<p></p>
</br>8 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:
</br>9 “The very hands of Ze·rub´ba·bel have laid the foundation of this house, and his own hands will finish [it]. And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me to YOU people.
</br>10 For who has despised the day of small things? And they will certainly rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of Ze·rub´ba·bel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah. They are roving about in all the earth.”
<p></p>
</br>11 And I proceeded to answer and say to him: “What do these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on its left side mean?”
</br>12 Then I answered the second time and said to him: “What are the two bunches of twigs of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden tubes, are pouring forth from within themselves the golden [liquid]?”

<p></p>
In turn I said: “I am seeing a flying scroll, the length of which is twenty cubits, and the breadth of which is ten cubits.”
<p></p>
</br>3 Then he said to me: “This is the curse that is going forth over the surface of all the earth, because everyone that is stealing, according to it on this side, has gone free of punishment; and everyone making a sworn oath, according to it on that side, has gone free of punishment.
</br>4 ‘I have caused it to go forth,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘and it must enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one making a sworn oath in my name falsely; and it must lodge in the midst of his house and exterminate it and its timbers and its stones.’”

</br>6 So I said: “What is it?”

In turn he said: “This is the e´phah measure that is going forth.” And he went on to say: “This is their aspect in all the earth.”
</br>7 And, look! the circular lid of lead was lifted up; and this is a certain woman sitting in the midst of the e´phah.
</br>8 So he said: “This is Wickedness.” And he proceeded to throw her [back] into the midst of the e´phah, after which he threw the lead weight upon its mouth.
<p></p>
</br>9 Then I raised my eyes and saw, and here there were two women coming forth, and wind was in their wings. And they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they gradually raised the e´phah up between the earth and the heavens.
</br>10 So I said to the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are they taking the e´phah?”

</br>2 In the first chariot there were red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses.
</br>3 And in the third chariot there were white horses; and in the fourth chariot, horses speckled, parti-colored.
<p></p>
</br>4 And I proceeded to answer and say to the angel who was speaking with me: “What are these, my lord?”
<p></p>
</br>5 So the angel answered and said to me: “These are the four spirits of the heavens that are going forth after having taken their station before the Lord of the whole earth.
</br>6 As for the one in which the black horses are, they are going forth to the land of the north; and as for the white ones, they must go forth to behind the sea; and as for the speckled ones, they must go forth to the land of the south.
</br>7 And as for the parti-colored ones, they must go forth and keep seeking [where] to go, in order to walk about in the earth.” Then he said: “Go, walk about in the earth.” And they began walking about in the earth.

</br>5 the buyers of which proceed to kill [them] although they are not held guilty. And those who are selling them say: “May Jehovah be blessed, while I shall gain riches.” And their own shepherds do not show any compassion upon them.’
<p></p>
</br>6 “‘For I shall show compassion no more upon the inhabitants of the land,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘So here I am causing mankind to find themselves, each one in the hand of his companion and in the hand of his king; and they will certainly crush to pieces the land, and I shall do no delivering out of their hand.’”
<p></p>
</br>7 And I proceeded to shepherd the flock [meant] for the killing, in YOUR behalf, O afflicted ones of the flock. So I took for myself two staffs. The one I called Pleasantness, and the other I called Union, and I went shepherding the flock.
</br>8 And I finally effaced three shepherds in one lunar month, as my soul gradually became impatient with them, and also their own soul felt a loathing toward me.
</br>9 At length I said: “I shall not keep shepherding YOU. The one that is dying, let her die. And the one that is being effaced, let her be effaced. And as for the ones left remaining, let them devour, each one the flesh of her companion.”
</br>10 So I took my staff Pleasantness and cut it to pieces, in order to break my covenant that I had concluded with all the peoples.
</br>11 And it came to be broken in that day, and the afflicted ones of the flock who were watching me got to know in this way that it was the word of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>12 Then I said to them: “If it is good in YOUR eyes, give [me] my wages; but if not, refrain.” And they proceeded to pay my wages, thirty pieces of silver.
<p></p>
</br>13 At that, Jehovah said to me: “Throw it to the treasury—the majestic value with which I have been valued from their standpoint.” Accordingly I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff, the Union, in order to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
<p></p>
</br>15 And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Take yet for yourself the implements of a useless shepherd.
</br>16 For here I am letting a shepherd rise up in the land. To the [sheep] being effaced he will give no attention. The young one he will not seek, and the broken [sheep] he will not heal. The one stationing herself he will not supply [with food], and the flesh of the fat one he will eat, and the hoofs of the [sheep] he will tear off.
</br>17 Woe to my valueless shepherd, who is leaving the flock! A sword will be upon his arm and upon his right eye. His own arm will without fail dry up, and his own right eye will without fail grow dim.”

</br>1 A pronouncement:
<p></p>
“The word of Jehovah concerning Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah, the One who is stretching out [the] heavens and laying the foundation of [the] earth and forming the spirit of man inside him.
</br>2 “Here I am making Jerusalem a bowl [causing] reeling to all the peoples round about; and also against Judah he will come to be in the siege, [even] against Jerusalem.
</br>3 And it must occur in that day [that] I shall make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples. All those lifting it will without fail get severe scratches for themselves; and against her all the nations of the earth will certainly be gathered.
</br>4 In that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “I shall strike every horse with bewilderment and its rider with madness; and upon the house of Judah I shall open my eyes, and every horse of the peoples I shall strike with loss of sight.
</br>5 And the sheiks of Judah will have to say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to me by Jehovah of armies their God.’
</br>6 In that day I shall make the sheiks of Judah like a firepot among trees and like a fiery torch in a row of newly cut grain, and they must devour on the right [hand] and on the left all the peoples round about; and Jerusalem must yet be inhabited in her [own] place, in Jerusalem.
<p></p>
</br>7 “And Jehovah will certainly save the tents of Judah first, to the end that the beauty of the house of David and the beauty of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not become too great over Judah.
</br>8 In that day Jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the one that is stumbling among them must become in that day like David, and the house of David like God, like Jehovah’s angel before them.
</br>9 And it must occur in that day [that] I shall seek to annihilate all the nations that are coming against Jerusalem.
<p></p>
</br>10 “And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of favor and entreaties, and they will certainly look to the One whom they pierced through, and they will certainly wail over Him as in the wailing over an only [son]; and there will be a bitter lamentation over him as when there is bitter lamentation over the firstborn [son].
</br>11 In that day the wailing in Jerusalem will be great, like the wailing of Ha·dad·rim´mon in the valley plain of Me·gid´do.
</br>12 And the land will certainly wail, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their women by themselves;
</br>13 the family of the house of Le´vi by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the Shim´e·ites by itself, and their women by themselves;
</br>14 all the families that are left remaining, each family by itself, and their women by themselves.

</br>1 “In that day there will come to be a well opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for an abhorrent thing.
<p></p>
</br>2 “And it must occur in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, “[that] I shall cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will no more be remembered; and also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I shall cause to pass out of the land.
</br>3 And it must occur [that] in case a man should prophesy anymore, his father and his mother, the ones who caused his birth, must also say to him, ‘You will not live, because falsehood is what you have spoken in the name of Jehovah.’ And his father and his mother, the ones who caused his birth, must pierce him through because of his prophesying.
<p></p>
</br>4 “And it must occur in that day [that] the prophets will become ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies; and they will not wear an official garment of hair for the purpose of deceiving.
</br>5 And he will certainly say, ‘I am no prophet. I am a man cultivating [the] soil, because an earthling man himself acquired me from my youth on.’
</br>6 And one must say to him, ‘What are these wounds [on your person] between your hands?’ And he will have to say, ‘Those with which I was struck in the house of my intense lovers.’”
<p></p>
</br>7 “O sword, awake against my shepherd, even against the able-bodied man who is my associate,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. “Strike the shepherd, and let those of the flock be scattered; and I shall certainly turn my hand back upon those who are insignificant.”
<p></p>
</br>8 “And it must occur in all the land,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “[that] two parts in it are what will be cut off [and] expire; and as for the third [part], it will be left remaining in it.
</br>9 And I shall certainly bring the third [part] through the fire; and I shall actually refine them as in the refining of silver, and examine them as in the examining of gold. It, for its part, will call upon my name, and I, for my part, will answer it. I will say, ‘It is my people,’ and it, in its turn, will say, ‘Jehovah is my God.’”

</br>1 “Look! There is a day coming, belonging to Jehovah, and the spoil of you will certainly be apportioned out in the midst of you.
</br>2 And I shall certainly gather all the nations against Jerusalem for the war; and the city will actually be captured and the houses be pillaged, and the women themselves will be raped. And half of the city must go forth into the exile; but as for the remaining ones of the people, they will not be cut off from the city.
<p></p>
</br>3 “And Jehovah will certainly go forth and war against those nations as in the day of his warring, in the day of fight.
</br>4 And his feet will actually stand in that day upon the mountain of the olive trees, which is in front of Jerusalem, on the east; and the mountain of the olive trees must be split at its middle, from the sunrising and to the west. There will be a very great valley; and half of the mountain will actually be moved to the north, and half of it to the south.
</br>5 And YOU people will certainly flee to the valley of my mountains; because the valley of [the] mountains will reach all the way to A´zel. And YOU will have to flee, just as YOU fled because of the [earth]quake in the days of Uz·zi´ah the king of Judah. And Jehovah my God will certainly come, all the holy ones being with him.
<p></p>
</br>6 “And it must occur in that day [that] there will prove to be no precious light—things will be congealed.
</br>7 And it must become one day that is known as belonging to Jehovah. It will not be day, neither will it be night; and it must occur [that] at evening time it will become light.
</br>8 And it must occur in that day [that] living waters will go forth from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. In summer and in winter it will occur.
</br>9 And Jehovah must become king over all the earth. In that day Jehovah will prove to be one, and his name one.
<p></p>
</br>10 “The whole land will be changed like the Ar´a·bah, from Ge´ba to Rim´mon to the south of Jerusalem; and she must rise and become inhabited in her place, from the Gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate, and [from] the Tower of Ha·nan´el all the way to the press vats of the king.
</br>11 And people will certainly inhabit her; and there will occur no more any banning [to destruction], and Jerusalem must be inhabited in security.
<p></p>
</br>12 “And this is what will prove to be the scourge with which Jehovah will scourge all the peoples that will actually do military service against Jerusalem: There will be a rotting away of one’s flesh, while one is standing upon one’s feet; and one’s very eyes will rot away in their sockets, and one’s very tongue will rot away in one’s mouth.
<p></p>
</br>13 “And it must occur in that day [that] confusion from Jehovah will become widespread among them; and they will actually grab hold, each one of the hand of his companion, and his hand will actually come up against the hand of his companion.
</br>14 And Judah itself also will be warring at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about will certainly be gathered, gold and silver and garments in excessive abundance.
<p></p>
</br>15 “And this is how the scourge of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the male ass, and every sort of domestic animal that happens to be in those camps, will prove to be, like this scourge.
<p></p>
</br>16 “And it must occur [that], as regards everyone who is left remaining out of all the nations that are coming against Jerusalem, they must also go up from year to year to bow down to the King, Jehovah of armies, and to celebrate the festival of the booths.
</br>17 And it must occur that, as regards anyone that does not come up out of the families of the earth to Jerusalem to bow down to the King, Jehovah of armies, even upon them no pouring rain will occur.
</br>18 And if the family of Egypt itself does not come up and does not actually enter, upon them also there shall be none. The scourge will occur with which Jehovah scourges the nations that do not come up to celebrate the festival of the booths.
</br>19 This itself will prove to be the [punishment for the] sin of Egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the festival of the booths.
<p></p>
</br>20 “In that day there will prove to be upon the bells of the horse ‘Holiness belongs to Jehovah!’ And the widemouthed cooking pots in the house of Jehovah must become like the bowls before the altar.
</br>21 And every widemouthed cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah must become something holy belonging to Jehovah of armies, and all those who are sacrificing must come in and take from them and must do boiling in them. And there will no more prove to be a Ca´naan·ite in the house of Jehovah of armies in that day.”
