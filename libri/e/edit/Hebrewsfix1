</br>1 God, who long ago spoke on many occasions and in many ways to our forefathers by means of the prophets,
</br>2 has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.
</br>3 He is the reflection of [his] glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power; and after he had made a purification for our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in lofty places.
</br>4 So he has become better than the angels, to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.
<p></p>
</br>5 For example, to which one of the angels did he ever say: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father”? And again: “I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son”?
</br>6 But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all God’s angels do obeisance to him.”
<p></p>
</br>7 Also, with reference to the angels he says: “And he makes his angels spirits, and his public servants a flame of fire.”
</br>8 But with reference to the Son: “God is your throne forever and ever, and [the] scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.
</br>9 You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with [the] oil of exultation more than your partners.”
</br>10 And: “You at [the] beginning, O Lord, laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are [the] works of your hands.
</br>11 They themselves will perish, but you yourself are to remain continually; and just like an outer garment they will all grow old,
</br>12 and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as an outer garment; and they will be changed, but you are the same, and your years will never run out.”
<p></p>
</br>13 But with reference to which one of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?
</br>14 Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?

</br>1 That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.
</br>2 For if the word spoken through angels proved to be firm, and every transgression and disobedient act received a retribution in harmony with justice;
</br>3 how shall we escape if we have neglected a salvation of such greatness in that it began to be spoken through [our] Lord and was verified for us by those who heard him,
</br>4 while God joined in bearing witness with signs as well as portents and various powerful works and with distributions of holy spirit according to his will?
<p></p>
</br>5 For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come, about which we are speaking.
</br>6 But a certain witness has given proof somewhere, saying: “What is man that you keep him in mind, or [the] son of man that you take care of him?
</br>7 You made him a little lower than angels; with glory and honor you crowned him, and appointed him over the works of your hands.
</br>8 All things you subjected under his feet.” For in that he subjected all things to him [God] left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him;
</br>9 but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every [man].
<p></p>
</br>10 For it was fitting for the one for whose sake all things are and through whom all things are, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
</br>11 For both he who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all [stem] from one, and for this cause he is not ashamed to call them “brothers,”
</br>12 as he says: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of [the] congregation I will praise you with song.”
</br>13 And again: “I will have my trust in him.” And again: “Look! I and the young children, whom Jehovah gave me.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil;
</br>15 and [that] he might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through their lives.
</br>16 For he is really not assisting angels at all, but he is assisting Abraham’s seed.
</br>17 Consequently he was obliged to become like his “brothers” in all respects, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people.
</br>18 For in that he himself has suffered when being put to the test, he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.

</br>1 Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest whom we confess—Jesus.
</br>2 He was faithful to the One that made him such, as Moses was also in all the house of that One.
</br>3 For the latter is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who constructs it has more honor than the house.
</br>4 Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.
</br>5 And Moses as an attendant was faithful in all the house of that One as a testimony of the things that were to be spoken afterwards,
</br>6 but Christ [was faithful] as a Son over the house of that One. We are the house of that One, if we make fast our hold on our freeness of speech and our boasting over the hope firm to the end.
<p></p>
</br>7 For this reason, just as the holy spirit says: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice,
</br>8 do not harden YOUR hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger, as in the day of making the test in the wilderness,
</br>9 in which YOUR forefathers made a test of me with a trial, and yet they had seen my works for forty years.
</br>10 For this reason I became disgusted with this generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they themselves have not come to know my ways.’
</br>11 So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter into my rest.’”
<p></p>
</br>12 Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of YOU a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God;
</br>13 but keep on exhorting one another each day, as long as it may be called “Today,” for fear any one of YOU should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.
</br>14 For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we make fast our hold on the confidence we had at the beginning firm to the end,
</br>15 while it is being said: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice, do not harden YOUR hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger.”
<p></p>
</br>16 For who were they that heard and yet provoked to bitter anger? Did not, in fact, all do so who went out of Egypt under Moses?
</br>17 Moreover, with whom did [God] become disgusted for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
</br>18 But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest except to those who acted disobediently?
</br>19 So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.

<p></p>
</br>1 Therefore, since a promise is left of entering into his rest, let us fear that sometime someone of YOU may seem to have fallen short of it.
</br>2 For we have had the good news declared to us also, even as they also had; but the word which was heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who did hear.
</br>3 For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world.
</br>4 For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”
</br>5 and again in this place: “They shall not enter into my rest.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Since, therefore, it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,
</br>7 he again marks off a certain day by saying after so long a time in David’s [psalm] “Today”; just as it has been said above: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice, do not harden YOUR hearts.”
</br>8 For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, [God] would not afterward have spoken of another day.
</br>9 So there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God.
</br>10 For the man that has entered into [God’s] rest has also himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.
<p></p>
</br>11 Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, for fear anyone should fall in the same pattern of disobedience.
</br>12 For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and [their] marrow, and [is] able to discern thoughts and intentions of [the] heart.
</br>13 And there is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.
<p></p>
</br>14 Seeing, therefore, that we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold onto [our] confessing of [him].
</br>15 For we have as high priest, not one who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in all respects like ourselves, but without sin.
</br>16 Let us, therefore, approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness, that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time.

<p></p>
</br>1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men over the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
</br>2 He is able to deal moderately with the ignorant and erring ones since he also is surrounded with his own weakness,
</br>3 and on its account he is obliged to make offerings for sins as much for himself as for the people.
<p></p>
</br>4 Also, a man takes this honor, not of his own accord, but only when he is called by God, just as Aaron also [was].
</br>5 So too the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but [was glorified by him] who spoke with reference to him: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.”
</br>6 Just as he says also in another place: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Mel·chiz´e·dek.”
<p></p>
</br>7 In the days of his flesh [Christ] offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death, with strong outcries and tears, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.
</br>8 Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered;
</br>9 and after he had been made perfect he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him,
</br>10 because he has been specifically called by God a high priest according to the manner of Mel·chiz´e·dek.
<p></p>
</br>11 Concerning him we have much to say and hard to be explained, since YOU have become dull in YOUR hearing.
</br>12 For, indeed, although YOU ought to be teachers in view of the time, YOU again need someone to teach YOU from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God; and YOU have become such as need milk, not solid food.
</br>13 For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.
</br>14 But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

<p></p>
</br>1 For this reason, now that we have left the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works, and faith toward God,
</br>2 the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment.
</br>3 And this we will do, if God indeed permits.
<p></p>
</br>4 For it is impossible as regards those who have once for all been enlightened, and who have tasted the heavenly free gift, and who have become partakers of holy spirit,
</br>5 and who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things,
</br>6 but who have fallen away, to revive them again to repentance, because they impale the Son of God afresh for themselves and expose him to public shame.
</br>7 For example, the ground that drinks in the rain which often comes upon it, and that then brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whom it is also cultivated, receives in return a blessing from God.
</br>8 But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed; and it ends up with being burned.
<p></p>
</br>9 However, in YOUR case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things and things accompanied with salvation, although we are speaking in this way.
</br>10 For God is not unrighteous so as to forget YOUR work and the love YOU showed for his name, in that YOU have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.
</br>11 But we desire each one of YOU to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end,
</br>12 in order that YOU may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
<p></p>
</br>13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,
</br>14 saying: “Assuredly in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you.”
</br>15 And thus after [Abraham] had shown patience, he obtained [this] promise.
</br>16 For men swear by the one greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, as it is a legal guarantee to them.
</br>17 In this manner God, when he purposed to demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, stepped in with an oath,
</br>18 in order that, through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to lay hold on the hope set before us.
</br>19 This [hope] we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain,
</br>20 where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, Jesus, who has become a high priest according to the manner of Mel·chiz´e·dek forever.
@@libHebrews

<p></p>
</br>1 For this Mel·chiz´e·dek, king of Sa´lem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
</br>2 and to whom Abraham apportioned a tenth from all things, is first of all, by translation, “King of Righteousness,” and is then also king of Sa´lem, that is, “King of Peace.”
</br>3 In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
<p></p>
</br>4 BEHOLD, then, how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.
</br>5 True, the men from the sons of Le´vi who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, even if these have issued from the loins of Abraham;
</br>6 but the man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
</br>7 Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.
</br>8 And in the one case it is men who are dying that receive tithes, but in the other case it is someone of whom it is witnessed that he lives.
</br>9 And, if I may use the expression, through Abraham even Le´vi who receives tithes has paid tithes,
</br>10 for he was still in the loins of his forefather when Mel·chiz´e·dek met him.
<p></p>
</br>11 If, then, perfection were really through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it as a feature the people were given the Law,) what further need would there be for another priest to arise according to the manner of Mel·chiz´e·dek and not said to be according to the manner of Aaron?
</br>12 For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law.
</br>13 For the man respecting whom these things are said has been a member of another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
</br>14 For it is quite plain that our Lord has sprung up out of Judah, a tribe about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
<p></p>
</br>15 And it is still more abundantly clear that with a similarity to Mel·chiz´e·dek there arises another priest,
</br>16 who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment depending upon the flesh, but according to the power of an indestructible life,
</br>17 for in witness it is said: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Mel·chiz´e·dek.”
<p></p>
</br>18 Certainly, then, there occurs a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and ineffectiveness.
</br>19 For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in besides of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God.
</br>20 Also, to the extent that it was not without a sworn oath,
</br>21 (for there are indeed men that have become priests without a sworn oath, but there is one with an oath sworn by the One who said respecting him: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret), ‘You are a priest forever,’”)
</br>22 to that extent also Jesus has become the one given in pledge of a better covenant.
</br>23 Furthermore, many had to become priests [in succession] because of being prevented by death from continuing as such,
</br>24 but he because of continuing alive forever has his priesthood without any successors.
</br>25 Consequently he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.
<p></p>
</br>26 For such a high priest as this was suitable for us, loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens.
</br>27 He does not need daily, as those high priests do, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for those of the people: (for this he did once for all time when he offered himself up;)
</br>28 for the Law appoints men high priests having weakness, but the word of the sworn oath that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is perfected forever.

<p></p>
</br>1 Now as to the things being discussed this is the main point: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
</br>2 a public servant of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah put up, and not man.
</br>3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
</br>4 If, now, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being [men] who offer the gifts according to the Law,
</br>5 but which [men] are rendering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to make the tent in completion, was given the divine command: For says he: “See that you make all things after [their] pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”
</br>6 But now [Jesus] has obtained a more excellent public service, so that he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established upon better promises.
<p></p>
</br>7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second;
</br>8 for he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! There are days coming,’ says Jehovah, ‘and I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;
</br>9 not according to the covenant that I made with their forefathers in [the] day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.”
<p></p>
</br>10 “‘For this is the covenant that I shall covenant with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I shall write them. And I will become their God, and they themselves will become my people.
<p></p>
</br>11 “‘And they will by no means teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” For they will all know me, from [the] least one to [the] greatest one of them.
</br>12 For I shall be merciful to their unrighteous deeds, and I shall by no means call their sins to mind anymore.’”
<p></p>
</br>13 In his saying “a new [covenant]” he has made the former one obsolete. Now that which is made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.
@@libHebrews 
</br>9 :

<p></p>
</br>1 For its part, then, the former [covenant] used to have ordinances of sacred service and [its] mundane holy place.
</br>2 For there was constructed a first tent [compartment] in which were the lampstand and also the table and the display of the loaves; and it is called “the Holy Place.”
</br>3 But behind the second curtain was the tent [compartment] called “the Most Holy.”
</br>4 This had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which were the golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant;
</br>5 but up above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory [cover]. But now is not the time to speak in detail concerning these things.
<p></p>
</br>6 After these things had been constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent [compartment] at all times to perform the sacred services;
</br>7 but into the second [compartment] the high priest alone enters once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people.
</br>8 Thus the holy spirit makes it plain that the way into the holy place had not yet been made manifest while the first tent was standing.
</br>9 This very [tent] is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here, and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the [man] doing sacred service perfect as respects his conscience,
</br>10 but have to do only with foods and drinks and various baptisms. They were legal requirements pertaining to the flesh and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight.
<p></p>
</br>11 However, when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come to pass, through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,
</br>12 he entered, no, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time into the holy place and obtained an everlasting deliverance [for us].
</br>13 For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies to the extent of cleanness of the flesh,
</br>14 how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to [the] living God?
<p></p>
</br>15 So that is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has occurred for [their] release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, the ones who have been called might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.
</br>16 For where there is a covenant, the death of the [human] covenanter needs to be furnished.
</br>17 For a covenant is valid over dead [victims], since it is not in force at any time while the [human] covenanter is living.
</br>18 Consequently neither was the former [covenant] inaugurated without blood.
</br>19 For when every commandment according to the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled the book itself and all the people,
</br>20 saying: “This is the blood of the covenant that God has laid as a charge upon YOU.”
</br>21 And he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the public service likewise with the blood.
</br>22 Yes, nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.
<p></p>
</br>23 Therefore it was necessary that the typical representations of the things in the heavens should be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices that are better than such sacrifices.
</br>24 For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.
</br>25 Neither is it in order that he should offer himself often, as indeed the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood not his own.
</br>26 Otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to put sin away through the sacrifice of himself.
</br>27 And as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment,
</br>28 so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin and to those earnestly looking for him for [their] salvation.
@@libHebrews 
</br>10 :

<p></p>
</br>1 For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, [men] can never with the same sacrifices from year to year which they offer continually make those who approach perfect.
</br>2 Otherwise, would the [sacrifices] not have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service who had been cleansed once for all time would have no consciousness of sins anymore?
</br>3 To the contrary, by these sacrifices there is a reminding of sins from year to year,
</br>4 for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.
<p></p>
</br>5 Hence when he comes into the world he says: “‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.
</br>6 You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin [offering].’
</br>7 Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’”
</br>8 After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin [offering]”—[sacrifices] that are offered according to the Law—
</br>9 then he actually says: “Look! I am come to do your will.” He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second.
</br>10 By the said “will” we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.
<p></p>
</br>11 Also, every priest takes his station from day to day to render public service and to offer the same sacrifices often, as these are at no time able to take sins away completely.
</br>12 But this [man] offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually and sat down at the right hand of God,
</br>13 from then on awaiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.
</br>14 For it is by one [sacrificial] offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect perpetually.
</br>15 Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said:
</br>16 “‘This is the covenant that I shall covenant toward them after those days,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I shall write them,’”
</br>17 [it says afterwards:] “And I shall by no means call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind anymore.”
</br>18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
<p></p>
</br>19 Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
</br>20 which he inaugurated for us as a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,
</br>21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
</br>22 let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience and our bodies bathed with clean water.
</br>23 Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.
</br>24 And let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works,
</br>25 not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as YOU behold the day drawing near.
<p></p>
</br>26 For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left,
</br>27 but [there is] a certain fearful expectation of judgment and [there is] a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.
</br>28 Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three.
</br>29 Of how much more severe a punishment, do YOU think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?
</br>30 For we know him that said: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense”; and again: “Jehovah will judge his people.”
</br>31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of [the] living God.
<p></p>
</br>32 However, keep on remembering the former days in which, after YOU were enlightened, YOU endured a great contest under sufferings,
</br>33 sometimes while YOU were being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations, and sometimes while YOU became sharers with those who were having such an experience.
</br>34 For YOU both expressed sympathy for those in prison and joyfully took the plundering of YOUR belongings, knowing YOU yourselves have a better and an abiding possession.

</br>35 Do not, therefore, throw away YOUR freeness of speech, which has a great reward to be paid it.
</br>36 For YOU have need of endurance, in order that, after YOU have done the will of God, YOU may receive the [fulfillment of the] promise.
</br>37 For yet “a very little while,” and “he who is coming will arrive and will not delay.”
</br>38 “But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,” and, “if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”
</br>39 Now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.

</br>1 Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.
</br>2 For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.
<p></p>
</br>3 By faith we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God’s word, so that what is beheld has come to be out of things that do not appear.
<p></p>
</br>4 By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than Cain, through which [faith] he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness respecting his gifts; and through it he, although he died, yet speaks.
<p></p>
</br>5 By faith E´noch was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him; for before his transference he had the witness that he had pleased God well.
</br>6 Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please [him] well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.
<p></p>
</br>7 By faith Noah, after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this [faith] he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith.
<p></p>
</br>8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going.
</br>9 By faith he resided as an alien in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, and dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise.
</br>10 For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and maker of which [city] is God.
<p></p>
</br>11 By faith also Sarah herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past the age limit, since she esteemed him faithful who had promised.
</br>12 Hence also from one [man], and him as good as dead, there were born [children] just as the stars of heaven for multitude and as the sands that are by the seaside, innumerable.
<p></p>
</br>13 In faith all these died, although they did not get the [fulfillment of the] promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.
</br>14 For those who say such things give evidence that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own.
</br>15 And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that [place] from which they had gone forth, they would have had opportunity to return.
</br>16 But now they are reaching out for a better [place], that is, one belonging to heaven. Hence God is not ashamed of them, to be called upon as their God, for he has made a city ready for them.
<p></p>
</br>17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up [his] only-begotten [son],
</br>18 although it had been said to him: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.”
</br>19 But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.
<p></p>
</br>20 By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and E´sau concerning things to come.
<p></p>
</br>21 By faith Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning upon the top of his staff.
<p></p>
</br>22 By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel; and he gave a command concerning his bones.
<p></p>
</br>23 By faith Moses was hid for three months by his parents after his birth, because they saw the young child was beautiful and they did not fear the order of the king.
</br>24 By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Phar´aoh,
</br>25 choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,
</br>26 because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.
</br>27 By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.
</br>28 By faith he had celebrated the passover and the splashing of the blood, that the destroyer might not touch their firstborn ones.
<p></p>
</br>29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but on venturing out upon it the Egyptians were swallowed up.
<p></p>
</br>30 By faith the walls of Jer´i·cho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
</br>31 By faith Ra´hab the harlot did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way.
<p></p>
</br>32 And what more shall I say? For the time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gid´e·on, Ba´rak, Samson, Jeph´thah, David as well as Samuel and the [other] prophets,
</br>33 who through faith defeated kingdoms in conflict, effected righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
</br>34 stayed the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from a weak state were made powerful, became valiant in war, routed the armies of foreigners.
</br>35 Women received their dead by resurrection; but other [men] were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection.
</br>36 Yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by bonds and prisons.
</br>37 They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn asunder, they died by slaughter with the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while they were in want, in tribulation, under ill-treatment;
</br>38 and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves and dens of the earth.
<p></p>
</br>39 And yet all these, although they had witness borne to them through their faith, did not get the [fulfillment of the] promise,
</br>40 as God foresaw something better for us, in order that they might not be made perfect apart from us.

<p></p>
</br>1 So, then, because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
</br>2 as we look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
</br>3 Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests, that YOU may not get tired and give out in YOUR souls.
<p></p>
</br>4 In carrying on YOUR contest against that sin YOU have never yet resisted as far as blood,
</br>5 but YOU have entirely forgotten the exhortation which addresses YOU as sons: “My son, do not belittle [the] discipline from Jehovah, neither give out when you are corrected by him;
</br>6 for whom Jehovah loves he disciplines; in fact, he scourges every one whom he receives as a son.”
<p></p>
</br>7 It is for discipline YOU are enduring. God is dealing with YOU as with sons. For what son is he that a father does not discipline?
</br>8 But if YOU are without the discipline of which all have become partakers, YOU are really illegitimate children, and not sons.
</br>9 Furthermore, we used to have fathers who were of our flesh to discipline us, and we used to give them respect. Shall we not much more subject ourselves to the Father of our spiritual life and live?
</br>10 For they for a few days used to discipline us according to what seemed good to them, but he does so for our profit that we may partake of his holiness.
</br>11 True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.
<p></p>
</br>12 Hence straighten up the hands that hang down and the enfeebled knees,
</br>13 and keep making straight paths for YOUR feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather that it may be healed.
</br>14 Pursue peace with all people, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,
</br>15 carefully watching that no one may be deprived of the undeserved kindness of God; that no poisonous root may spring up and cause trouble and that many may not be defiled by it;
</br>16 that there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things, like E´sau, who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn.
</br>17 For YOU know that afterward also when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for, although he earnestly sought a change of mind with tears, he found no place for it.
<p></p>
</br>18 For YOU have not approached that which can be felt and which has been set aflame with fire, and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a tempest,
</br>19 and the blare of a trumpet and the voice of words; on hearing which voice the people implored that no word should be added to them.
</br>20 For the command was not bearable to them: “And if a beast touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”
</br>21 Also, the display was so fearsome that Moses said: “I am fearful and trembling.”
</br>22 But YOU have approached a Mount Zion and a city of [the] living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels,
</br>23 in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect,
</br>24 and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, which speaks in a better way than Abel’s [blood].
<p></p>
</br>25 See that YOU do not beg off from him who is speaking. For if they did not escape who begged off from him who was giving divine warning upon earth, much more shall we not if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens.
</br>26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying: “Yet once more I will set in commotion not only the earth but also the heaven.”
</br>27 Now the expression “Yet once more” signifies the removal of the things being shaken as things that have been made, in order that the things not being shaken may remain.
</br>28 Wherefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.
</br>29 For our God is also a consuming fire.

<p></p>
</br>1 Let YOUR brotherly love continue.
</br>2 Do not forget hospitality, for through it some, unknown to themselves, entertained angels.
</br>3 Keep in mind those in prison bonds as though YOU have been bound with them, and those being ill-treated, since YOU yourselves also are still in a body.
</br>4 Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
</br>5 Let [YOUR] manner of life be free of the love of money, while YOU are content with the present things. For he has said: “I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you.”
</br>6 So that we may be of good courage and say: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?”
<p></p>
</br>7 Remember those who are taking the lead among YOU, who have spoken the word of God to YOU, and as YOU contemplate how [their] conduct turns out imitate [their] faith.
<p></p>
</br>8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.
<p></p>
</br>9 Do not be carried away with various and strange teachings; for it is fine for the heart to be given firmness by undeserved kindness, not by eatables, by which those who occupy themselves with them have not been benefited.
<p></p>
</br>10 We have an altar from which those who do sacred service at the tent have no authority to eat.
</br>11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest for sin are burned up outside the camp.
</br>12 Hence Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
</br>13 Let us, then, go forth to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore,
</br>14 for we do not have here a city that continues, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come.
</br>15 Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.
</br>16 Moreover, do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
<p></p>
</br>17 Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among YOU and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over YOUR souls as those who will render an account; that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to YOU.
<p></p>
</br>18 Carry on prayer for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.
</br>19 But I exhort YOU more especially to do this, that I may be restored to YOU the sooner.
<p></p>
</br>20 Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus,
</br>21 equip YOU with every good thing to do his will, performing in us through Jesus Christ that which is well-pleasing in his sight; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p></p>
</br>22 Now I exhort YOU, brothers, to bear with this word of encouragement, for I have, indeed, composed a letter to YOU in few words.
</br>23 Take note that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes quite soon, I shall see YOU.
<p></p>
</br>24 Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead among YOU and to all the holy ones. Those in Italy send YOU their greetings.
<p></p>
</br>25 The undeserved kindness be with all of YOU.
