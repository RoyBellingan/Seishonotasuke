</br>1 The word of Jehovah that occurred to Ho·se´a the son of Be·e´ri in the days of Uz·zi´ah, Jo´tham, A´haz [and] Hez·e·ki´ah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jer·o·bo´am the son of Jo´ash, the king of Israel.
</br>2 There was a start of the word of Jehovah by Ho·se´a, and Jehovah proceeded to say to Ho·se´a: “Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication and children of fornication, because by fornication the land positively turns from following Jehovah.”
<p></p>
</br>3 And he proceeded to go and take Go´mer the daughter of Dib·la´im, so that she became pregnant and in time bore to him a son.
<p></p>
</br>4 And Jehovah went on to say to him: “Call his name Jez´re·el, for yet a little while and I must hold an accounting for the acts of bloodshed of Jez´re·el against the house of Je´hu, and I must cause the royal rule of the house of Israel to cease.
</br>5 And it must occur in that day that I must break the bow of Israel in the low plain of Jez´re·el.”
<p></p>
</br>6 And she proceeded to become pregnant another time and to give birth to a daughter. And He went on to say to him: “Call her name Lo-ru·ha´mah, for I shall no more show mercy again to the house of Israel, because I shall positively take them away.
</br>7 But to the house of Judah I shall show mercy, and I will save them by Jehovah their God; but I shall not save them by a bow or by a sword or by war, by horses or by horsemen.”
<p></p>
</br>8 And she gradually weaned Lo-ru·ha´mah, and she proceeded to become pregnant and give birth to a son.
</br>9 So He said: “Call his name Lo-am´mi, because YOU men are not my people and I myself shall prove to be not YOURS.
<p></p>
</br>10 “And the number of the sons of Israel must become like the grains of the sand of the sea that cannot be measured or numbered. And it must occur that in the place in which it used to be said to them, ‘YOU men are not my people,’ it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’
</br>11 And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will certainly be collected together into a unity and will actually set up for themselves one head and go up out of the land, because great will be the day of Jez´re·el.

</br>3 that I may not strip her naked and actually place her as in the day of her being born, and actually set her like a wilderness and place her like a waterless land and put her to death with thirst.
</br>4 And to her sons I shall not show mercy, for they are the sons of fornication.
</br>5 For their mother has committed fornication. She that was pregnant with them has acted shamefully, for she has said, ‘I want to go after those passionately loving me, those giving my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’

</br>8 But she herself did not recognize that it was I who had given to her the grain and the sweet wine and the oil, and that I had made silver itself abound for her, and gold, [which] they made use of for Ba´al.

</br>13 And I will hold an accounting against her for the days of the Ba´al images to which she kept making sacrificial smoke, when she kept decking herself with her ring and her ornament and kept going after her passionate lovers, and I was the one that she forgot,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.

</br>18 And for them I shall certainly conclude a covenant in that day in connection with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground, and the bow and the sword and war I shall break out of the land, and I will make them lie down in security.

</br>22 and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jez´re·el [‘God will sow seed’].
</br>23 And I shall certainly sow her like seed for me in the earth, and I will show mercy to her who was not shown mercy, and I will say to those not my people: “You are my people”; and they, for their part, will say: “[You are] my God.”’”

</br>2 There are the pronouncing of curses and practicing of deception and murdering and stealing and committing of adultery that have broken forth, and acts of bloodshed have touched other acts of bloodshed.
</br>3 That is why the land will mourn and every inhabitant in it will have to fade away with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens, and even the fishes of the sea themselves will be gathered [in death].

</br>4 “However, let no man contend, neither let a man reprove, as your people are like those who are contending against a priest.
</br>5 And you will certainly stumble in the daytime, and even a prophet must stumble with you, as at night. And I will put your mother to silence.
</br>6 My people will certainly be silenced, because there is no knowledge. Because the knowledge is what you yourself have rejected, I shall also reject you from serving as a priest to me; and [because] you keep forgetting the law of your God, I shall forget your sons, even I.

</br>8 The sin of my people is what they keep devouring, and to their error they keep lifting up their soul.

</br>10 And they will actually eat, but will not get satisfied. They will actually treat [women] as harlots; but they will not increase, because they have left off paying regard to Jehovah himself.
</br>11 Fornication and wine and sweet wine are what take away good motive.
</br>12 Of their wooden [idol] my own people keep inquiring, and their own [hand] staff keeps telling them; because the very spirit of fornication has caused them to wander off, and by fornication they go out from under their God.
</br>13 On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, and on the hills they make sacrificial smoke, under massive tree and storax tree and big tree, because its shade is good. That is why YOUR daughters commit fornication and YOUR own daughters-in-law commit adultery.

</br>14 “I shall not hold an accounting against YOUR daughters because they commit fornication, and against YOUR daughters-in-law because they commit adultery. For, as to the [men], it is with the harlots that they get off to themselves, and with the female temple prostitutes that they sacrifice; and a people [that] does not understand will be trodden down.
</br>15 Although you are committing fornication, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty, and do not YOU people come to Gil´gal, neither go up to Beth-a´ven nor swear ‘As Jehovah is alive!’
</br>16 For, like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn. Is it now that Jehovah will shepherd them like a young ram in a roomy place?

</br>6 “And as respects you, to your God you should return, keeping loving-kindness and justice; and let there be a hoping in your God constantly.
</br>7 As regards [the] tradesman, in his hand are the scales of deception; to defraud is what he has loved.
</br>8 And E´phra·im keeps saying, ‘Indeed, I have become rich; I have found valuable things for myself. As regards all my toiling, they will find, on my part, no error that is sin.’

</br>9 “But I am Jehovah your God from the land of Egypt. Yet I shall make you dwell in the tents as in the days of an appointed time.
</br>10 And I spoke to the prophets, and visions I myself multiplied, and by the hand of the prophets I kept making likenesses.

</br>11 “With Gil´e·ad what is uncanny, also untruth, have occurred. In Gil´gal they have sacrificed even bulls. Moreover, their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the open field.
</br>12 And Jacob proceeded to run away to the field of Syria, and Israel kept serving for a wife, and for a wife he guarded [sheep].
</br>13 And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.
</br>14 E´phra·im caused offense to bitterness, and his deeds of bloodshed he leaves upon his own self, and his reproach his grand Master will repay to him.”

</br>1 “When E´phra·im spoke, there was trembling; he himself carried [weight] in Israel. But he proceeded to become guilty in regard to Ba´al and die.
</br>2 And now they commit additional sin and make for themselves a molten statue from their silver, idols according to their own understanding, the work of craftsmen, all of it. To them they are saying, ‘Let the sacrificers who are men kiss mere calves.’
</br>3 Therefore they will become like the clouds of morning and like the dew that early goes away; like chaff that is stormed away from the threshing floor and like smoke from the [roof] hole.

</br>4 “But I am Jehovah your God from the land of Egypt, and there was no God except me that you used to know; and there was no savior but I.
</br>5 I myself knew you in the wilderness, in the land of fevers.
</br>6 According to their pasturage they also came to be satisfied. They became satisfied and their heart began to be exalted. That is why they forgot me.
</br>7 And I shall become to them like a young lion. Like a leopard by [the] way I shall keep looking.
</br>8 I shall encounter them like a bear that has lost its cubs, and I shall rip apart the enclosure of their heart. And I shall devour them there like a lion; a wild beast of the field itself will tear them to pieces.
</br>9 It will certainly bring you to ruin, O Israel, because it was against me, against your helper.
<p></p>
</br>10 “Where, then, is your king, that he may save you in all your cities, and your judges, [concerning] whom you said, ‘Do give me a king and princes’?
</br>11 I proceeded to give you a king in my anger, and I shall take [him] away in my fury.

</br>12 “The error of E´phra·im is wrapped up, his sin is treasured up.
</br>13 The labor pangs of a woman giving birth are what will come to him. He is a son not wise, for in season he will not stand still at the breaking forth of sons [from the womb].

</br>2 Take with yourselves words and come back to Jehovah. Say to him, all YOU people, ‘May you pardon error; and accept what is good, and we will offer in return the young bulls of our lips.
</br>3 As·syr´i·a itself will not save us. Upon horses we shall not ride. And no more shall we say: “O our God!” to the work of our hands, because it is by you that a fatherless boy is shown mercy.’

</br>5 I shall become like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and will strike his roots like Leb´a·non.
</br>6 His twigs will go forth, and his dignity will become like that of the olive tree, and his fragrance will be like that of Leb´a·non.
</br>7 They will again be dwellers in his shadow. They will grow grain, and will bud like the vine. His memorial will be like the wine of Leb´a·non.
