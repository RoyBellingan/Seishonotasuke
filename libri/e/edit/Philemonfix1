</br>1 Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, [our] brother, to Phi·le´mon, our beloved one and fellow worker,
</br>2 and to Ap´phi·a, our sister, and to Ar·chip´pus, our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:
<p></p>
</br>3 May YOU people have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.
<p></p>
</br>4 I always thank my God when I make mention of you in my prayers,
</br>5 as I keep hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy ones;
</br>6 in order that the sharing of your faith may go into action by your acknowledging of every good thing among us as related to Christ.
</br>7 For I got much joy and comfort over your love, because the tender affections of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.
<p></p>
</br>8 For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,
</br>9 I am exhorting you rather on the basis of love, seeing that I am such as I am, Paul an aged man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;
</br>10 I am exhorting you concerning my child, to whom I became a father while in my [prison] bonds, O·nes´i·mus,
</br>11 formerly useless to you but now useful to you and to me.
</br>12 This very one I am sending back to you, yes, him, that is, my own tender affections.
<p></p>
</br>13 I would like to hold him back for myself that in place of you he might keep on ministering to me in the [prison] bonds I bear for the sake of the good news.
</br>14 But without your consent I do not want to do anything, so that your good act may be, not as under compulsion, but of your own free will.
</br>15 Perhaps really on this account he broke away for an hour, that you may have him back forever,
</br>16 no longer as a slave but as more than a slave, as a brother beloved, especially so to me, yet how much more so to you both in fleshly relationship and in [the] Lord.
</br>17 If, therefore, you consider me a sharer, receive him kindly the way you would me.
</br>18 Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, keep this charged to my account.
</br>19 I Paul am writing with my own hand: I will pay it back—not to be telling you that, besides, you owe me even yourself.
</br>20 Yes, brother, may I derive profit from you in connection with [the] Lord: refresh my tender affections in connection with Christ.
<p></p>
</br>21 Trusting in your compliance, I am writing you, knowing you will even do more than the things I say.
</br>22 But along with that, also get lodging ready for me, for I am hoping that through the prayers of YOU people I shall be set at liberty for YOU.
<p></p>
</br>23 Sending you greetings is Ep´a·phras my fellow captive in union with Christ,
</br>24 [also] Mark, Ar·is·tar´chus, De´mas, Luke, my fellow workers.
<p></p>
</br>25 The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with the spirit YOU people [show].
