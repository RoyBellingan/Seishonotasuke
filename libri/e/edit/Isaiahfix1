<p></p>
</br>1 The vision of Isaiah the son of A´moz that he visioned concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uz·zi´ah, Jo´tham, A´haz [and] Hez·e·ki´ah, kings of Judah:
<p></p>
</br>2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken: “Sons I have brought up and raised, but they themselves have revolted against me.
</br>3 A bull well knows its buyer, and the ass the manger of its owner; Israel itself has not known, my own people have not behaved understandingly.”
<p></p>
</br>4 Woe to the sinful nation, the people heavy with error, an evildoing seed, ruinous sons! They have left Jehovah, they have treated the Holy One of Israel with disrespect, they have turned backwards.
</br>5 Where else will YOU be struck still more, in that YOU add more revolt? The whole head is in a sick condition, and the whole heart is feeble.
</br>6 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no sound spot in it. Wounds and bruises and fresh stripes—they have not been squeezed out or bound up, nor has there been a softening with oil.
</br>7 YOUR land is a desolation, YOUR cities are burned with fire; YOUR ground—right in front of YOU strangers are eating it up, and the desolation is like an overthrow by strangers.
</br>8 And the daughter of Zion has been left remaining like a booth in a vineyard, like a lookout hut in a field of cucumbers, like a blockaded city.
</br>9 Unless Jehovah of armies himself had left remaining to us just a few survivors, we should have become just like Sod´om, we should have resembled Go·mor´rah itself.
<p></p>
</br>10 Hear the word of Jehovah, YOU dictators of Sod´om. Give ear to the law of our God, YOU people of Go·mor´rah.
</br>11 “Of what benefit to me is the multitude of YOUR sacrifices?” says Jehovah. “I have had enough of whole burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed animals; and in the blood of young bulls and male lambs and he-goats I have taken no delight.
</br>12 When YOU people keep coming in to see my face, who is it that has required this from YOUR hand, to trample my courtyards?
</br>13 Stop bringing in any more valueless grain offerings. Incense—it is something detestable to me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of a convention—I cannot put up with the [use of] uncanny power along with the solemn assembly.
</br>14 YOUR new moons and YOUR festal seasons my soul has hated. To me they have become a burden; I have become tired of bearing [them].
</br>15 And when YOU spread out YOUR palms, I hide my eyes from YOU. Even though YOU make many prayers, I am not listening; with bloodshed YOUR very hands have become filled.
</br>16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the badness of YOUR dealings from in front of my eyes; cease to do bad.
</br>17 Learn to do good; search for justice; set right the oppressor; render judgment for the fatherless boy; plead the cause of the widow.”
<p></p>
</br>18 “Come, now, YOU people, and let us set matters straight between us,” says Jehovah. “Though the sins of YOU people should prove to be as scarlet, they will be made white just like snow; though they should be red like crimson cloth, they will become even like wool.
</br>19 If YOU people show willingness and do listen, the good of the land YOU will eat.
</br>20 But if YOU people refuse and are actually rebellious, with a sword YOU will be eaten up; for the very mouth of Jehovah has spoken [it].”
<p></p>
</br>21 O how the faithful town has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness itself used to lodge in her, but now murderers.
</br>22 Your silver itself has become scummy dross. Your wheat beer is diluted with water.
</br>23 Your princes are stubborn and partners with thieves. Every one of them is a lover of a bribe and a chaser after gifts. For a fatherless boy they do not render judgment; and even the legal case of a widow does not get admittance to them.
<p></p>
</br>24 Therefore the utterance of the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, the Powerful One of Israel, is: “Aha! I shall relieve myself of my adversaries, and I will avenge myself on my enemies.
</br>25 And I will turn back my hand upon you, and I shall smelt away your scummy dross as with lye, and I will remove all your waste products.
</br>26 And I will bring back again judges for you as at the first, and counselors for you as at the start. After this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town.
</br>27 With justice Zion herself will be redeemed, and those returning of her, with righteousness.
</br>28 And the crash of revolters and that of sinful ones will be at the same time, and those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish.
</br>29 For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that YOU people desired, and YOU will be abashed because of the gardens that YOU have chosen.
</br>30 For YOU will become like a big tree the foliage of which is withering, and like a garden that has no water.
</br>31 And the vigorous man will certainly become tow, and the product of his activity a spark; and both of them will certainly go up in flames at the same time, with no one to do the extinguishing.”

</br>1 The thing that Isaiah the son of A´moz visioned concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
</br>2 And it must occur in the final part of the days [that] the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, and it will certainly be lifted up above the hills; and to it all the nations must stream.
</br>3 And many peoples will certainly go and say: “Come, YOU people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For out of Zion law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.
</br>4 And he will certainly render judgment among the nations and set matters straight respecting many peoples. And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.
<p></p>
</br>5 O men of the house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>6 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob. For they have become full of what is from the East, and they are practicers of magic like the Phi·lis´tines, and with the children of foreigners they abound.
</br>7 And their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no limit to their treasures. And their land is filled with horses, and there is no limit to their chariots.
</br>8 And their land is filled with valueless gods. To the work of one’s hands they bow down, to that which one’s fingers have made.
</br>9 And earthling man bows down, and man becomes low, and you cannot possibly pardon them.
<p></p>
</br>10 Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust because of the dreadfulness of Jehovah, and from his splendid superiority.
</br>11 The haughty eyes of earthling man must become low, and the loftiness of men must bow down; and Jehovah alone must be put on high in that day.
</br>12 For it is the day belonging to Jehovah of armies. It is upon everyone self-exalted and lofty and upon everyone lifted up or low;
</br>13 and upon all the cedars of Leb´a·non that are lofty and lifted up and upon all the massive trees of Ba´shan;
</br>14 and upon all the lofty mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up;
</br>15 and upon every high tower and upon every fortified wall;
</br>16 and upon all the ships of Tar´shish and upon all desirable boats.
</br>17 And the haughtiness of the earthling man must bow down, and the loftiness of men must become low; and Jehovah alone must be put on high in that day.
<p></p>
</br>18 And the valueless gods themselves will pass away completely.
</br>19 And people will enter into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the dust because of the dreadfulness of Jehovah and from his splendid superiority, when he rises up for the earth to suffer shocks.
</br>20 In that day the earthling man will throw his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold that they had made for him to bow before to the shrewmice and to the bats,
</br>21 in order to enter into the holes in the rocks and into the clefts of the crags, because of the dreadfulness of Jehovah and from his splendid superiority, when he rises up for the earth to suffer shocks.

</br>1 For, look! the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, is removing from Jerusalem and from Judah support and stay, the whole support of bread and the whole support of water,
</br>2 mighty man and warrior, judge and prophet, and practicer of divination and elderly man,
</br>3 chief of fifty and highly respected man and counselor and expert in magical arts, and the skilled charmer.
</br>4 And I shall certainly make boys their princes, and mere arbitrary power will rule over them.
</br>5 And the people will actually tyrannize one over the other, even each one over his fellowman. They will storm, the boy against the old man, and the lightly esteemed one against the one to be honored.
</br>6 For each one will lay hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying:] “You have a mantle. A dictator you ought to become to us, and this overthrown mass should be under your hand.”
</br>7 He will raise [his voice] in that day, saying: “I shall not become a wound dresser; and in my house there is neither bread nor a mantle. YOU men must not set me as dictator over the people.”
<p></p>
</br>8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah itself has fallen, because their tongue and their dealings are against Jehovah, in behaving rebelliously in the eyes of his glory.
</br>9 The very expression of their faces actually testifies against them, and of their sin like that of Sod´om they do tell. They have not hidden [it]. Woe to their soul! For they have dealt out to themselves calamity.
<p></p>
</br>10 Say, YOU men, that it [will be] well with the righteous one, for they will eat the very fruitage of their dealings.
</br>11 Woe to the wicked one!—Calamity; for the treatment [rendered] by his own hands will be rendered to him!
</br>12 As for my people, its task assigners are dealing severely, and mere women actually rule over it. O my people, those leading you on are causing [you] to wander, and the way of your paths they have confused.
<p></p>
</br>13 Jehovah is stationing himself to contend and is standing up to pass sentence upon peoples.
</br>14 Jehovah himself will enter into judgment with the elderly ones of his people and its princes.
<p></p>
“And YOU yourselves have burned down the vineyard. What was taken by robbery from the afflicted one is in YOUR houses.
</br>15 What do YOU men mean in that YOU crush my people, and that YOU grind the very faces of the afflicted ones?” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.
<p></p>
</br>16 And Jehovah says: “For the reason that the daughters of Zion have become haughty and they walk with their throats stretched forth and ogling with their eyes, they go walking with tripping steps, and with their feet they make a tinkling sound,
</br>17 Jehovah also will actually make the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion scabby, and Jehovah himself will lay their very forehead bare.
</br>18 In that day Jehovah will take away the beauty of the bangles and the headbands and the moon-shaped ornaments,
</br>19 the eardrops and the bracelets and the veils,
</br>20 the headdresses and the step chains and the breastbands and the ‘houses of the soul’ and the ornamental humming shells,
</br>21 the finger rings and the nose rings,
</br>22 the robes of state and the overtunics and the cloaks and the purses,
</br>23 and the hand mirrors and the undergarments and the turbans and the large veils.
<p></p>
</br>24 “And it must occur that instead of balsam oil there will come to be merely a musty smell; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of an artistic hair arrangement, baldness; and instead of a rich garment, a girding of sackcloth; a brand mark instead of prettiness.
</br>25 By the sword your own men will fall, and your mightiness by war.

</br>2 In that day what Jehovah makes sprout will come to be for decoration and for glory, and the fruitage of the land will be something to be proud of and something beautiful for those of Israel who have escaped.
</br>3 And it must occur that the ones remaining in Zion and the ones left over in Jerusalem will be said to be holy to him, everyone written down for life in Jerusalem.
<p></p>
</br>4 When Jehovah will have washed away the excrement of the daughters of Zion and he will rinse away even the bloodshed of Jerusalem from within her by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning down,
</br>5 Jehovah will also certainly create over every established place of Mount Zion and over her convention place a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; because over all the glory there will be a shelter.

</br>1 Let me sing, please, to my beloved one a song of my loved one concerning his vineyard. There was a vineyard that my beloved one came to have on a fruitful hillside.
</br>2 And he proceeded to dig it up and to rid it of stones and to plant it with a choice red vine, and to build a tower in the middle of it. And there was also a winepress that he hewed out in it. And he kept hoping for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes.
<p></p>
</br>3 “And now, O YOU inhabitants of Jerusalem and YOU men of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard.
</br>4 What is there yet to do for my vineyard that I have not already done in it? Why is it that I hoped for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes?
</br>5 And now, please, may I make known to YOU men what I am doing to my vineyard: There will be a removing of its hedge, and it must be destined for burning down. There must be a breaking down of its stone wall, and it must be destined for a place of trampling.
</br>6 And I shall set it as a thing destroyed. It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed. And it must come up with the thornbush and weeds; and upon the clouds I shall lay a command to keep from precipitating any rain upon it.
</br>7 For the vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plantation of which he was fond. And he kept hoping for judgment, but, look! the breaking of law; for righteousness, but, look! an outcry.”
<p></p>
</br>8 Woe to the ones joining house to house, [and] those who annex field to field until there is no more room and YOU men have been made to dwell all by yourselves in the midst of the land!
</br>9 In my ears Jehovah of armies [has sworn that] many houses, though great and good, will become an outright object of astonishment, without an inhabitant.
</br>10 For even ten acres of vineyard will produce but one bath measure, and even a ho´mer measure of seed will produce but an e´phah measure.
<p></p>
</br>11 Woe to those who are getting up early in the morning that they may seek just intoxicating liquor, who are lingering till late in the evening darkness so that wine itself inflames them!
</br>12 And there must prove to be harp and stringed instrument, tambourine and flute, and wine at their feasts; but the activity of Jehovah they do not look at, and the work of his hands they have not seen.
<p></p>
</br>13 Therefore my people will have to go into exile for lack of knowledge; and their glory will be famished men, and their crowd will be parched with thirst.
</br>14 Therefore She´ol has made its soul spacious and has opened its mouth wide beyond bounds; and what is splendid in her, also her crowd and her uproar and the exultant one, will certainly go down into it.
</br>15 And earthling man will bow down, and man will become low, and even the eyes of the high ones will become low.
</br>16 And Jehovah of armies will become high through judgment, and the [true] God, the Holy One, will certainly sanctify himself through righteousness.
</br>17 And the male lambs will actually graze as in their pasture; and the desolate places of well-fed animals alien residents will eat.
<p></p>
</br>18 Woe to those drawing error with ropes of untruth, and as with wagon cords sin;
</br>19 those who are saying: “Let his work hasten; do let it come quickly, in order that we may see [it]; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know [it]!”
<p></p>
</br>20 Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness, those who are putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
<p></p>
</br>21 Woe to those wise in their own eyes and discreet even in front of their own faces!
<p></p>
</br>22 Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine, and to the men with vital energy for mixing intoxicating liquor,
</br>23 those who are pronouncing the wicked one righteous in consideration of a bribe, and who take away even the righteousness of the righteous one from him!
<p></p>
</br>24 Therefore just as a tongue of fire eats up the stubble and into the flames mere dried grass sinks down, their very rootstock will become just like a musty smell, and their blossom itself will go up just like powder, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of armies, and the saying of the Holy One of Israel they have disrespected.
</br>25 That is why the anger of Jehovah has grown hot against his people, and he will stretch out his hand against them and strike them. And the mountains will be agitated, and their dead bodies will become like the offal in the midst of the streets.
<p></p>
In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.
</br>26 And he has raised up a signal to a great nation far away, and he has whistled to it at the extremity of the earth; and, look! in haste it will swiftly come in.
</br>27 There is no one tired nor is anyone stumbling among them. No one is drowsy and no one sleeps. And the belt around their loins will certainly not be opened, nor the laces of their sandals be torn in two;
</br>28 because their arrows are sharpened and all their bows are bent. The very hoofs of their horses will have to be accounted as flint itself, and their wheels as a storm wind.
</br>29 The roaring of theirs is like that of a lion, and they roar like maned young lions. And they will growl and grab hold of the prey and bring [it] safely away, and there will be no deliverer.
</br>30 And they will growl over it in that day as with the growling of the sea. And one will actually gaze at the land, and, look! there is distressing darkness; and even the light has grown dark because of the drops falling on it.

</br>1 In the year that King Uz·zi´ah died I, however, got to see Jehovah, sitting on a throne lofty and lifted up, and his skirts were filling the temple.
</br>2 Seraphs were standing above him. Each one had six wings. With two he kept his face covered, and with two he kept his feet covered, and with two he would fly about.
</br>3 And this one called to that one and said: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies. The fullness of all the earth is his glory.”
</br>4 And the pivots of the thresholds began to quiver at the voice of the one calling, and the house itself gradually filled with smoke.
<p></p>
</br>5 And I proceeded to say: “Woe to me! For I am as good as brought to silence, because a man unclean in lips I am, and in among a people unclean in lips I am dwelling; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of armies, himself!”
<p></p>
</br>6 At that, one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand there was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs off the altar.
</br>7 And he proceeded to touch my mouth and to say: “Look! This has touched your lips, and your error has departed and your sin itself is atoned for.”
<p></p>
</br>8 And I began to hear the voice of Jehovah saying: “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I proceeded to say: “Here I am! Send me.”
</br>9 And he went on to say: “Go, and you must say to this people, ‘Hear again and again, O men, but do not understand; and see again and again, but do not get any knowledge.’
</br>10 Make the heart of this people unreceptive, and make their very ears unresponsive, and paste their very eyes together, that they may not see with their eyes and with their ears they may not hear, and that their own heart may not understand and that they may not actually turn back and get healing for themselves.”
<p></p>
</br>11 At this I said: “How long, O Jehovah?” Then he said: “Until the cities actually crash in ruins, to be without an inhabitant, and the houses be without earthling man, and the ground itself is ruined into a desolation;
</br>12 and Jehovah actually removes earthling men far away, and the deserted condition does become very extensive in the midst of the land.

</br>2 And a report was made to the house of David, saying: “Syria has leaned upon E´phra·im.”
<p></p>
And his heart and the heart of his people began to quiver, like the quivering of the trees of the forest because of a wind.
<p></p>
</br>3 And Jehovah proceeded to say to Isaiah: “Go out, please, to meet A´haz, you and She´ar-ja´shub your son, to the end of the conduit of the upper pool by the highway of the laundryman’s field.
</br>4 And you must say to him, ‘Watch yourself and keep undisturbed. Do not be afraid, and do not let your heart itself be timid because of the two tail ends of these smoking logs, because of the hot anger of Re´zin and Syria and the son of Rem·a·li´ah,
</br>5 for the reason that Syria [with] E´phra·im and the son of Rem·a·li´ah has advised what is bad against you, saying:
</br>6 “Let us go up against Judah and tear it apart and by breakthroughs take it for ourselves; and let us make another king reign inside it, the son of Tab´e·el.”

</br>7 “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “It will not stand, neither will it take place.
</br>8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Re´zin; and within just sixty-five years E´phra·im will be shattered to pieces so as not to be a people.
</br>9 And the head of E´phra·im is Sa·mar´i·a, and the head of Sa·mar´i·a is the son of Rem·a·li´ah. Unless YOU people have faith, YOU will in that case not be of long duration.”’”
<p></p>
</br>10 And Jehovah went on speaking some more to A´haz, saying:
</br>11 “Ask for yourself a sign from Jehovah your God, making it as deep as She´ol or making it high as the upper regions.”
</br>12 But A´haz said: “I shall not ask, neither shall I put Jehovah to the test.”
<p></p>
</br>13 And he proceeded to say: “Listen, please, O house of David. Is it such a little thing for YOU to tire out men, that YOU should also tire out my God?
</br>14 Therefore Jehovah himself will give YOU men a sign: Look! The maiden herself will actually become pregnant, and she is giving birth to a son, and she will certainly call his name Im·man´u·el.
</br>15 Butter and honey he will eat by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good.
</br>16 For before the boy will know how to reject the bad and choose the good, the ground of whose two kings you are feeling a sickening dread will be left entirely.
</br>17 Jehovah will bring against you and against your people and against the house of your father days such as have not come since the day of E´phra·im’s turning away from alongside Judah, namely, the king of As·syr´i·a.

</br>18 “And it must occur in that day that Jehovah will whistle for the flies that are at the extremity of the Nile canals of Egypt and for the bees that are in the land of As·syr´i·a,

</br>20 “In that day, by means of a hired razor in the region of the River, even by means of the king of As·syr´i·a, Jehovah will shave the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away even the beard itself.

</br>21 “And it must occur in that day that an individual will preserve alive a young cow of the herd and two sheep.
</br>22 And it must occur that, due to the abundance of the producing of milk, he will eat butter; because butter and honey are what everyone left remaining in the midst of the land will eat.
<p></p>
</br>23 “And it must occur in that day that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, will come to be—for the thornbushes and for the weeds it will come to be.
</br>24 With arrows and the bow he will come there, because all the land will become mere thornbushes and weeds.

</br>11 For this is what Jehovah has said to me with strongness of the hand, that he may make me turn aside from walking in the way of this people, saying:
</br>12 “YOU men must not say, ‘A conspiracy!’ respecting all that of which this people keep saying, ‘A conspiracy!’ and the object of their fear YOU men must not fear, nor must YOU tremble at it.

</br>14 And he must become as a sacred place; but as a stone to strike against and as a rock over which to stumble to both the houses of Israel, as a trap and as a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
</br>15 And many among them will be certain to stumble and to fall and be broken, and to be snared and caught.

</br>16 Wrap up the attestation, put a seal about the law among my disciples!
</br>17 And I will keep in expectation of Jehovah, who is concealing his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
<p></p>
</br>18 Look! I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in Israel from Jehovah of armies, who is residing in Mount Zion.
<p></p>
</br>19 And in case they should say to YOU people: “Apply to the spiritistic mediums or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping and making utterances in low tones,” is it not to its God that any people should apply? [Should there be application] to dead persons in behalf of living persons?
</br>20 To the law and to the attestation!

</br>2 The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light. As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.
</br>3 You have made the nation populous; for it you have made the rejoicing great. They have rejoiced before you as with the rejoicing in the harvesttime, as those who are joyful when they divide up the spoil.
<p></p>
</br>4 For the yoke of their load and the rod upon their shoulders, the staff of the one driving them to work, you have shattered to pieces as in the day of Mid´i·an.
</br>5 For every boot of the one tramping with tremors and the mantle rolled in blood have even come to be for burning as food for fire.
</br>6 For there has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
</br>7 To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite. The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.

</br>8 There was a word that Jehovah sent against Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.
</br>9 And the people will certainly know [it], even all of them, E´phra·im and the inhabitant of Sa·mar´i·a, because of [their] haughtiness and because of [their] insolence of heart in saying:
</br>10 “Bricks are what have fallen, but with hewn stone we shall build. Sycamore trees are what have been cut down, but with cedars we shall make replacement.”
</br>11 And Jehovah will set the adversaries of Re´zin on high against him, and the enemies of that one he will goad on,
</br>12 Syria from the east and the Phi·lis´tines from behind, and they will eat up Israel with open mouth. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.
<p></p>
</br>13 And the people themselves have not returned to the One striking them, and Jehovah of armies they have not sought.
</br>14 And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, shoot and rush, in one day.
</br>15 The aged and highly respected one is the head, and the prophet giving false instruction is the tail.
</br>16 And those who are leading this people on prove to be the ones causing [them] to wander; and those of them who are being led on, the ones who are being confused.
</br>17 That is why Jehovah will not rejoice even over their young men, and upon their fatherless boys and upon their widows he will have no mercy; because all of them are apostates and evildoers and every mouth is speaking senselessness. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.
<p></p>
</br>18 For wickedness has become aflame just like a fire; thornbushes and weeds it will eat up. And it will catch fire in the thickets of the forest, and they will be borne aloft as the billowing of smoke.
</br>19 In the fury of Jehovah of armies the land has been set afire, and the people will become as food for the fire. No one will show compassion even on his brother.
</br>20 And one will cut down on the right and will certainly be hungry; and one will eat on the left, and they will certainly not be satisfied. They will each one eat the flesh of his own arm,
</br>21 Ma·nas´seh E´phra·im, and E´phra·im Ma·nas´seh. Together they will be against Judah. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.

</br>6 Against an apostate nation I shall send him, and against the people of my fury I shall issue a command to him, to take much spoil and to take much plunder and to make it a trampling place like the clay of the streets.
</br>7 Though he may not be that way, he will feel inclined; though his heart may not be that way, he will scheme, because to annihilate is in his heart, and to cut off nations not a few.
</br>8 For he will say, ‘Are not my princes at the same time kings?
</br>9 Is not Cal´no just like Car´che·mish? Is not Ha´math just like Ar´pad? Is not Sa·mar´i·a just like Damascus?

</br>12 “And it must occur that when Jehovah terminates all his work in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I shall make an accounting for the fruitage of the insolence of the heart of the king of As·syr´i·a and for the self-importance of his loftiness of eyes.
</br>13 For he has said, ‘With the power of my hand I shall certainly act, and with my wisdom, for I do have understanding; and I shall remove the boundaries of peoples, and their things stored up I shall certainly pillage, and I shall bring down the inhabitants just like a powerful one.
</br>14 And just as if a nest, my hand will reach the resources of the peoples; and just as when one gathers eggs that have been left, I myself will gather up even all the earth, and there will certainly be no one fluttering [his] wings or opening [his] mouth or chirping.’”

</br>15 Will the ax enhance itself over the one chopping with it, or the saw magnify itself over the one moving it back and forth, as though the staff moved back and forth the ones raising it on high, as though the rod raised on high the one who is not wood?
</br>16 Therefore the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, will keep sending upon his fat ones a wasting disease, and under his glory a burning will keep burning away like the burning of a fire.
</br>17 And Israel’s Light must become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it must blaze up and eat up his weeds and his thornbushes in one day.
</br>18 And the glory of his forest and of his orchard He will bring to an end, even from the soul clear to the flesh, and it must become like the melting away of one that is ailing.
</br>19 And the rest of the trees of his forest—they will become such a number that a mere boy will be able to write them down.

</br>20 And it will certainly occur in that day that those remaining over of Israel and those who have escaped of the house of Jacob will never again support themselves upon the one striking them, and they will certainly support themselves upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in trueness.
</br>21 A mere remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.
</br>22 For although your people, O Israel, would prove to be like the grains of sand of the sea, a mere remnant among them will return. An extermination decided upon will be flooding through in righteousness,
</br>23 because an exterminating and a strict decision the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, will be executing in the midst of the whole land.
<p></p>
</br>24 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has said: “Do not be afraid, O my people who are dwelling in Zion, because of the As·syr´i·an, who with the rod used to strike [you] and who used to lift up his own staff against you in the way that Egypt did.
</br>25 For yet a very little while—and the denunciation will have come to an end, and my anger, in their wearing away.

</br>5 Otherwise let him take hold of my stronghold, let him make peace with me; peace let him make with me.”
<p></p>
</br>6 In the coming [days] Jacob will take root, Israel will put forth blossoms and actually sprout; and they will simply fill the surface of the productive land with produce.
<p></p>
</br>7 As with the stroke of one striking him does one have to strike him? Or as with the slaughter of his killed ones does he have to be killed?
</br>8 With a scare cry you will contend with her when sending her forth. He must expel [her] with his blast, a hard one in the day of the east wind.
</br>9 Therefore by this means the error of Jacob will be atoned for, and this is all the fruit [when] he takes away his sin, when he makes all the stones of the altar like chalkstones that have been pulverized, so that the sacred poles and the incense stands will not rise up.
</br>10 For the fortified city will be solitary, the pasture ground will be left to itself and abandoned like a wilderness. There the calf will graze, and there it will lie down; and he will actually consume her boughs.
</br>11 When her sprigs have dried up, women coming in will break [them] off, lighting them up. For it is not a people of keen understanding. That is why its Maker will show it no mercy, and its own Former will show it no favor.
<p></p>
</br>12 And it must occur in that day that Jehovah will beat off [the fruit], from the flowing stream of the River to the torrent valley of Egypt, and so YOU yourselves will be picked up one after the other, O sons of Israel.
</br>13 And it must occur in that day that there will be a blowing on a great horn, and those who are perishing in the land of As·syr´i·a and those who are dispersed in the land of Egypt will certainly come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

</br>1 Woe to the eminent crown of the drunkards of E´phra·im, and the fading blossom of its decoration of beauty that is upon the head of the fertile valley of those overpowered by wine!
</br>2 Look! Jehovah has someone strong and vigorous. Like a thunderous storm of hail, a destructive storm, like a thunderous storm of powerful, flooding waters, he will certainly do a casting down to the earth with force.
</br>3 With the feet the eminent crowns of the drunkards of E´phra·im will be trampled down.
</br>4 And the fading flower of its decoration of beauty that is upon the head of the fertile valley must become like the early fig before summer, that, when the seer sees it, while it is yet in his palm, he swallows it down.
<p></p>
</br>5 In that day Jehovah of armies will become as a crown of decoration and as a garland of beauty to the ones remaining over of his people,
</br>6 and as a spirit of justice to the one sitting in the judgment, and as mightiness [to] those turning away the battle from the gate.
<p></p>
</br>7 And these also—because of wine they have gone astray and because of intoxicating liquor they have wandered about. Priest and prophet—they have gone astray because of intoxicating liquor, they have become confused as a result of the wine, they have wandered about as a result of the intoxicating liquor; they have gone astray in their seeing, they have reeled as to decision.
</br>8 For the tables themselves have all become full of filthy vomit—there is no place [without it].
<p></p>
</br>9 Whom will one instruct in knowledge, and whom will one make understand what has been heard? Those who have been weaned from the milk, those moved away from the breasts?
</br>10 For it is “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, here a little, there a little.”
</br>11 For by those stammering with their lips and by a different tongue he will speak to this people,
</br>12 those to whom he has said: “This is the resting-place. GIVE rest to the weary one. And this is the place of ease,” but who were not willing to hear.
</br>13 And to them the word of Jehovah will certainly become “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, here a little, there a little,” in order that they may go and certainly stumble backwards and actually be broken and ensnared and caught.
<p></p>
</br>14 Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, YOU braggarts, YOU rulers of this people who are in Jerusalem:
</br>15 Because YOU men have said: “We have concluded a covenant with Death; and with She´ol we have effected a vision; the overflowing flash flood, in case it should pass through, will not come to us, for we have made a lie our refuge and in falsehood we have concealed ourselves”;
</br>16 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, the precious corner of a sure foundation. No one exercising faith will get panicky.
</br>17 And I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the leveling instrument; and the hail must sweep away the refuge of a lie, and the waters themselves will flood out the very place of concealment.
</br>18 And YOUR covenant with Death will certainly be dissolved, and that vision of YOURS with She´ol will not stand. The overflowing flash flood, when it passes through—YOU must also become for it a trampling place.
</br>19 As often as it passes through, it will take YOU men away, because morning by morning it will pass through, during the day and during the night; and it must become nothing but a reason for quaking to make [others] understand what has been heard.”
<p></p>
</br>20 For the couch has proved too short for stretching oneself on, and the woven sheet itself is [too] narrow when wrapping oneself up.
</br>21 For Jehovah will rise up just as at Mount Pe·ra´zim, he will be agitated just as in the low plain near Gib´e·on, that he may do his deed—his deed is strange—and that he may work his work—his work is unusual.
</br>22 And now do not show yourselves scoffers, in order that YOUR bands may not grow strong, for there is an extermination, even something decided upon, that I have heard of from the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, for all the land.
<p></p>
</br>23 Give ear, YOU men, and listen to my voice; pay attention and listen to my saying.
</br>24 Is it all day long that the plower plows in order to sow seed, that he loosens and harrows his ground?
</br>25 Does he not, when he has smoothed out its surface, then scatter black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, and must he not put in wheat, millet, and barley in the appointed place, and spelt as his boundary?
</br>26 And one corrects him according to what is right. His own God instructs him.
</br>27 For it is not with a threshing instrument that black cumin is given a treading; and upon cumin no wheel of a wagon is turned. For it is with a rod that black cumin is generally beaten out, and cumin with a staff.
</br>28 Is breadstuff itself generally crushed? For never does one incessantly keep treading it out. And he must set the roller of his wagon in motion, and his own steeds, [but] he will not crush it.
</br>29 This also is what has come forth from Jehovah of armies himself, who has been wonderful in counsel, who has done greatly in effectual working.

</br>3 And I must encamp on all sides against you, and I must lay siege to you with a palisade and raise up against you siegeworks.
</br>4 And you must become low so that you will speak from the very earth, and as from the dust your saying will sound low. And like a spirit medium your voice must become even from the earth, and from the dust your own saying will chirp.
</br>5 And the crowd of those strange to you must become just like fine powder, and the crowd of the tyrants just like the chaff that is passing away. And it must occur in an instant, suddenly.
</br>6 From Jehovah of armies you will have attention with thunder and with quaking and with a great sound, storm wind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.”

<p></p>
</br>9 Linger, YOU men, and be amazed; blind yourselves, and be blinded. They have become intoxicated, but not with wine; they have moved unsteadily, but not because of intoxicating liquor.
<p></p>
</br>10 For upon YOU men Jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep; and he closes YOUR eyes, the prophets, and he has covered even YOUR heads, the visionaries.
</br>11 And for YOU men the vision of everything becomes like the words of the book that has been sealed up, which they give to someone knowing the writing, saying: “Read this out loud, please,” and he has to say: “I am unable, for it is sealed up”;
</br>12 and the book must be given to someone that does not know writing, [somebody] saying: “Read this out loud, please,” and he has to say: “I do not know writing at all.”
<p></p>
</br>13 And Jehovah says: “For the reason that this people have come near with their mouth, and they have glorified me merely with their lips, and they have removed their heart itself far away from me, and their fear toward me becomes men’s commandment that is being taught,
</br>14 therefore here I am, the One that will act wonderfully again with this people, in a wonderful manner and with something wonderful; and the wisdom of their wise men must perish, and the very understanding of their discreet men will conceal itself.”
<p></p>
</br>15 Woe to those who are going very deep in concealing counsel from Jehovah himself, and whose deeds have occurred in a dark place, while they say: “Who is seeing us, and who is knowing of us?”
</br>16 The perversity of YOU men! Should the potter himself be accounted just like the clay? For should the thing made say respecting its maker: “He did not make me”? And does the very thing formed actually say respecting its former: “He showed no understanding”?
<p></p>
</br>17 Is it not yet but a very little time and Leb´a·non must be turned into an orchard and the orchard itself will be accounted just as a forest?
</br>18 And in that day the deaf ones will certainly hear the words of the book, and out of the gloom and out of the darkness even the eyes of the blind ones will see.
</br>19 And the meek ones will certainly increase their rejoicing in Jehovah himself, and even the poor ones of mankind will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel himself,
</br>20 because the tyrant must reach his end, and the bragger must come to his finish, and all those keeping alert to do harm must be cut off,
</br>21 those bringing a man into sin by [his] word, and those who lay bait even for the one reproving in the gate, and those who push aside the righteous one with empty arguments.
<p></p>
</br>22 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said to the house of Jacob, he that redeemed Abraham: “Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will his own face now grow pale;
</br>23 for when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name, and they will certainly sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel they will regard with awe.

</br>2 those who are setting out to go down to Egypt and who have not inquired of my own mouth, to take shelter in the stronghold of Phar´aoh and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
</br>3 And the stronghold of Phar´aoh must become even for YOU men a reason for shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt a cause for humiliation.
</br>4 For his princes have come to be in Zo´an itself, and his own envoys reach even Ha´nes.

</br>10 who have said to the ones seeing, ‘YOU must not see,’ and to the ones having visions, ‘YOU must not envision for us any straightforward things. Speak to us smooth things; envision deceptive things.
</br>11 Turn aside from the way; deviate from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease just on account of us.’”
<p></p>
</br>12 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel has said: “In view of YOUR rejecting of this word, and [since] YOU men trust in defrauding and in what is devious and YOU support yourselves on it,
</br>13 therefore for YOU this error will become like a broken section about to fall down, a swelling out in a highly raised wall, the breakdown of which may come suddenly, in an instant.
</br>14 And one will certainly break it as in the breaking of a large jar of the potters, crushed to pieces without one’s sparing [it], so that there cannot be found among its crushed pieces a fragment of earthenware with which to rake the fire from the fireplace or to skim water from a marshy place.”
<p></p>
</br>15 For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By coming back and resting YOU people will be saved. YOUR mightiness will prove to be simply in keeping undisturbed and in trustfulness.” But YOU were not willing.
</br>16 And YOU proceeded to say: “No, but on horses we shall flee!” That is why YOU will flee. “And on swift [horses] we shall ride!” That is why those pursuing YOU will show themselves swift.
</br>17 A thousand will tremble on account of the rebuke of one; on account of the rebuke of five YOU will flee until YOU will have remained over like a mast on the top of a mountain and like a signal on a hill.
<p></p>
</br>18 And therefore Jehovah will keep in expectation of showing YOU favor, and therefore he will rise up to show YOU mercy. For Jehovah is a God of judgment. Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him.
</br>19 When the very people in Zion will dwell in Jerusalem, you will by no means weep. He will without fail show you favor at the sound of your outcry; as soon as he hears it he will actually answer you.
</br>20 And Jehovah will certainly give YOU people bread in the form of distress and water in the form of oppression; yet your Grand Instructor will no longer hide himself, and your eyes must become [eyes] seeing your Grand Instructor.
</br>21 And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: “This is the way. Walk in it, YOU people,” in case YOU people should go to the right or in case YOU should go to the left.
<p></p>
</br>22 And YOU people must defile the overlaying of your graven images of silver and the close-fitting covering of your molten statue of gold. You will scatter them. Like a menstruating woman, you will say to it: “Mere dirt!”
</br>23 And he will certainly give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, and as the produce of the ground bread, which must become fat and oily. Your livestock will graze in that day in a spacious pasture.
</br>24 And the cattle and the full-grown asses cultivating the ground will eat fodder seasoned with sorrel, which was winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
</br>25 And upon every high mountain and upon every elevated hill there must come to be streams, water ditches, in the day of the big slaughter when the towers fall.
</br>26 And the light of the full moon must become as the light of the glowing [sun]; and the very light of the glowing [sun] will become seven times as much, like the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breakdown of his people and heals even the severe wound resulting from the stroke by him.

</br>28 And his spirit is like a flooding torrent that reaches clear to the neck, to swing the nations to and fro with a sieve of worthlessness; and a bridle that causes one to wander about will be in the jaws of the peoples.
</br>29 YOU people will come to have a song like that in the night that one sanctifies oneself for a festival, and rejoicing of heart like that of one walking with a flute to enter into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>30 And Jehovah will certainly make the dignity of his voice to be heard and will make the descending of his arm to be seen, in the raging of anger and the flame of a devouring fire [and] cloudburst and rainstorm and hailstones.
</br>31 For because of the voice of Jehovah As·syr´i·a will be struck with terror; he will strike [it] even with a staff.
</br>32 And every swing of his rod of chastisement that Jehovah will cause to settle down upon [As·syr´i·a] will certainly prove to be with tambourines and with harps; and with battles of brandishing he will actually fight against them.

</br>1 Now it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hez·e·ki´ah that Sen·nach´er·ib the king of As·syr´i·a came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.
</br>2 And the king of As·syr´i·a finally sent Rab´sha·keh from La´chish to Jerusalem, to King Hez·e·ki´ah, with a heavy military force, and he proceeded to stand still by the conduit of the upper pool at the highway of the laundryman’s field.
</br>3 Then there came out to him E·li´a·kim the son of Hil·ki´ah, who was over the household, and Sheb´na the secretary and Jo´ah the son of A´saph the recorder.
<p></p>
</br>4 Accordingly Rab´sha·keh said to them: “Please, say to Hez·e·ki´ah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of As·syr´i·a, has said: “What is this confidence in which you have trusted?
</br>5 You have said (but it is the word of lips), ‘There are counsel and mightiness for the war.’ Now in whom have you put trust, that you have rebelled against me?
</br>6 Look! You have trusted in the support of this crushed reed, in Egypt, which, if a man should brace himself upon it, would certainly enter into his palm and pierce it. That is the way Phar´aoh the king of Egypt is to all those putting their trust in him.
</br>7 And in case you should say to me, ‘It is Jehovah our God in whom we have trusted,’ is he not the one whose high places and whose altars Hez·e·ki´ah has removed, while he says to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Before this altar YOU should bow down’?”’
</br>8 Now, then, make a wager, please, with my lord the king of As·syr´i·a, and let me give you two thousand horses [to see] whether you are able, on your part, to put riders upon them.
</br>9 How, then, could you turn back the face of one governor of the smallest servants of my lord, while you, for your part, put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
</br>10 And now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this land to bring it to ruin? Jehovah himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and you must bring it to ruin.’”
<p></p>
</br>11 At this E·li´a·kim and Sheb´na and Jo´ah said to Rab´sha·keh: “Speak, please, to your servants in the Syrian language, for we are listening; and do not speak to us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.”
</br>12 But Rab´sha·keh said: “Is it to your lord and to you that my lord has sent me to speak these words? Is it not to the men sitting upon the wall, that they may eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with YOU men?”
<p></p>
</br>13 And Rab´sha·keh continued to stand and call out in a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and he went on to say: “HEAR the words of the great king, the king of As·syr´i·a.
</br>14 This is what the king has said, ‘Do not let Hez·e·ki´ah deceive YOU people, for he is not able to deliver YOU.
</br>15 And do not let Hez·e·ki´ah cause YOU to trust in Jehovah, saying: “Without fail Jehovah will deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of As·syr´i·a.”
</br>16 Do not listen to Hez·e·ki´ah, for this is what the king of As·syr´i·a has said: “Make a capitulation to me and come out to me and eat each one from his own vine and each one from his own fig tree and drink each one the water of his own cistern,
</br>17 until I come and actually take YOU to a land like YOUR own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards;
</br>18 in order that Hez·e·ki´ah may not allure YOU, saying, ‘Jehovah himself will deliver us.’ Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of As·syr´i·a?
</br>19 Where are the gods of Ha´math and Ar´pad? Where are the gods of Seph·ar·va´im? And have they delivered Sa·mar´i·a out of my hand?
</br>20 Who are there among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand so that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?”’”
<p></p>
</br>21 And they continued to keep silent and did not answer him a word, for the commandment of the king was, saying: “YOU must not answer him.”
</br>22 But E·li´a·kim the son of Hil·ki´ah, who was over the household, and Sheb´na the secretary and Jo´ah the son of A´saph the recorder came to Hez·e·ki´ah with their garments ripped apart, and told him the words of Rab´sha·keh.

<p></p>
</br>1 And it came about that as soon as King Hez·e·ki´ah heard, he immediately ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and came into the house of Jehovah.
</br>2 Further, he sent E·li´a·kim, who was over the household, and Sheb´na the secretary and the older men of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the son of A´moz the prophet.
</br>3 And they proceeded to say to him: “This is what Hez·e·ki´ah has said, ‘This day is a day of distress and of rebuke and of scornful insolence, for the sons have come as far as the womb’s mouth, and there is no power to give birth.
</br>4 Perhaps Jehovah your God will hear the words of Rab´sha·keh, whom the king of As·syr´i·a his lord sent to taunt the living God, and he will actually call him to account for the words that Jehovah your God has heard. And you must lift up prayer in behalf of the remnant that are to be found.’”
<p></p>
</br>5 So the servants of King Hez·e·ki´ah came in to Isaiah.
</br>6 Then Isaiah said to them: “This is what YOU should say to YOUR lord, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard with which the attendants of the king of As·syr´i·a spoke abusively of me.
</br>7 Here I am putting a spirit in him, and he must hear a report and return to his own land; and I shall certainly cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
<p></p>
</br>8 After that Rab´sha·keh returned and found the king of As·syr´i·a fighting against Lib´nah, for he had heard that he had pulled away from La´chish.
</br>9 Now he heard it said concerning Tir·ha´kah the king of E·thi·o´pi·a: “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard, he at once sent messengers to Hez·e·ki´ah, saying:
</br>10 “This is what YOU men should say to Hez·e·ki´ah the king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you are trusting deceive you, saying: “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As·syr´i·a.”
</br>11 Look! You yourself have heard what the kings of As·syr´i·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction, and will you yourself be delivered?
</br>12 Have the gods of the nations that my forefathers brought to ruin delivered them, even Go´zan and Ha´ran and Re´zeph and the sons of E´den that were in Tel-as´sar?
</br>13 Where is the king of Ha´math and the king of Ar´pad and the king of the city of Seph·ar·va´im—of He´na and of Iv´vah?’”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then Hez·e·ki´ah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them, after which Hez·e·ki´ah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it out before Jehovah.
</br>15 And Hez·e·ki´ah began to pray to Jehovah, saying:
</br>16 “O Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, sitting upon the cherubs, you alone are the [true] God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You yourself have made the heavens and the earth.
</br>17 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open your eyes, O Jehovah, and see, and hear all the words of Sen·nach´er·ib that he has sent to taunt the living God.
</br>18 It is a fact, O Jehovah, that the kings of As·syr´i·a have devastated all the lands, and their own land.
</br>19 And there was a consigning of their gods to the fire, because they were no gods, but the workmanship of man’s hands, wood and stone, so that they destroyed them.
</br>20 And now, O Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are [God] alone.”
<p></p>
</br>21 And Isaiah the son of A´moz proceeded to send to Hez·e·ki´ah, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning Sen·nach´er·ib the king of As·syr´i·a,

</br>31 And those who escape of the house of Judah, those who are left remaining, will certainly take root downward and produce fruitage upward.
</br>32 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth and those who escape out of Mount Zion. The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.

</br>33 “‘Therefore this is what Jehovah has said concerning the king of As·syr´i·a: “He will not come into this city, nor will he shoot an arrow there, nor confront it with a shield, nor cast up a siege rampart against it.”’

</br>18 Upon bare hills I shall open up rivers, and in the midst of the valley plains, springs. I shall make the wilderness into a reedy pool of water, and the waterless land into sources of water.
</br>19 In the wilderness I shall set the cedar tree, the acacia and the myrtle and the oil tree. In the desert plain I shall place the juniper tree, the ash and the cypress at the same time;
</br>20 in order that people may see and know and pay heed and have insight at the same time, that the very hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has himself created it.”

</br>23 Tell the things that are to come afterward, that we may know that YOU are gods. Yes, YOU ought to do good or do bad, that we may gaze about and see [it] at the same time.

</br>2 He will not cry out or raise [his voice], and in the street he will not let his voice be heard.
</br>3 No crushed reed will he break; and as for a dim flaxen wick, he will not extinguish it. In trueness he will bring forth justice.
</br>4 He will not grow dim nor be crushed until he sets justice in the earth itself; and for his law the islands themselves will keep waiting.

</br>5 This is what the [true] God, Jehovah, has said, the Creator of the heavens and the Grand One stretching them out; the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it:
</br>6 “I myself, Jehovah, have called you in righteousness, and I proceeded to take hold of your hand. And I shall safeguard you and give you as a covenant of the people, as a light of the nations,
</br>7 [for you] to open the blind eyes, to bring forth out of the dungeon the prisoner, out of the house of detention those sitting in darkness.

</br>8 “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.
<p></p>
</br>9 “The first things—here they have come, but new things I am telling out. Before they begin to spring up, I cause YOU people to hear [them].”

</br>10 Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise from the extremity of the earth, YOU men that are going down to the sea and to that which fills it, YOU islands and YOU inhabiting them.
</br>11 Let the wilderness and its cities raise [their voice], the settlements that Ke´dar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of the crag cry out in joy. From the top of the mountains let people cry aloud.
</br>12 Let them attribute to Jehovah glory, and in the islands let them tell forth even his praise.
<p></p>
</br>13 Like a mighty man Jehovah himself will go forth. Like a warrior he will awaken zeal. He will shout, yes, he will let out a war cry; over his enemies he will show himself mightier.

</br>14 “I have kept quiet for a long time. I continued silent. I kept exercising self-control. Like a woman giving birth I am going to groan, pant, and gasp at the same time.
</br>15 I shall devastate mountains and hills, and all their vegetation I shall dry up. And I will turn rivers into islands, and reedy pools I shall dry up.
</br>16 And I will make the blind ones walk in a way that they have not known; in a roadway that they have not known I shall cause them to tread. I shall turn a dark place before them into light, and rugged terrain into level land. These are the things that I will do for them, and I will not leave them.”
<p></p>
</br>17 They must be turned back, they will be very much ashamed, those who are putting trust in the carved image, those who are saying to a molten image: “YOU are our gods.”

</br>18 Hear, YOU deaf ones; and look forth to see, YOU blind ones.
</br>19 Who is blind, if not my servant, and who is deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as the one rewarded, or blind as the servant of Jehovah?
</br>20 It was a case of seeing many things, but you did not keep watching. It was a case of opening the ears, but you did not keep listening.
</br>21 Jehovah himself for the sake of his righteousness has taken a delight in that he should magnify the law and make it majestic.
</br>22 But it is a people plundered and pillaged, all of them being trapped in the holes, and in the houses of detention they have been kept hidden. They have come to be for plunder without a deliverer, for pillage without anyone to say: “Bring back!”
<p></p>
</br>23 Who among YOU people will give ear to this? Who will pay attention and listen for later times?
</br>24 Who has given Jacob for mere pillage, and Israel to the plunderers? Is it not Jehovah, the One against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they did not want to walk and to whose law they did not listen?

</br>18 O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
</br>19 And your offspring would become just like the sand, and the descendants from your inward parts like the grains of it. One’s name would not be cut off or be annihilated from before me.”

</br>20 Go forth, YOU people, out of Babylon! Run away from the Chal·de´ans. Tell forth even with the sound of a joyful cry, cause this to be heard. Make it to go forth to the extremity of the earth. Say: “Jehovah has repurchased his servant Jacob.

</br>2 And he proceeded to make my mouth like a sharp sword. In the shadow of his hand he has hidden me. And he gradually made me a polished arrow. He concealed me in his own quiver.
</br>3 And he went on to say to me: “You are my servant, O Israel, you the one in whom I shall show my beauty.”
<p></p>
</br>4 But as for me, I said: “It is for nothing that I have toiled. For unreality and vanity I have used up my own power. Truly my judgment is with Jehovah, and my wages with my God.”
</br>5 And now Jehovah, the One forming me from the belly as a servant belonging to him, has said [for me] to bring back Jacob to him, in order that to him Israel itself may be gathered. And I shall be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah, and my own God will have become my strength.
</br>6 And he proceeded to say: “It has been more than a trivial matter for you to become my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back even the safeguarded ones of Israel; I also have given you for a light of the nations, that my salvation may come to be to the extremity of the earth.”
<p></p>
</br>7 This is what Jehovah, the Repurchaser of Israel, his Holy One, has said to him that is despised in soul, to him that is detested by the nation, to the servant of rulers: “Kings themselves will see and certainly rise up, [and] princes, and they will bow down, by reason of Jehovah, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who chooses you.”

</br>8 This is what Jehovah has said: “In a time of goodwill I have answered you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you; and I kept safeguarding you that I might give you as a covenant for the people, to rehabilitate the land, to bring about the repossessing of the desolated hereditary possessions,
</br>9 to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’ to those who are in the darkness, ‘Reveal yourselves!’ By the ways they will pasture, and on all beaten paths their pasturing will be.
</br>10 They will not go hungry, neither will they go thirsty, nor will parching heat or sun strike them. For the One who is having pity upon them will lead them, and by the springs of water he will conduct them.
</br>11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways themselves will be on an elevation.

</br>16 Look! Upon [my] palms I have engraved you. Your walls are in front of me constantly.
</br>17 Your sons have hurried up. The very ones tearing you down and devastating you will go forth even from you.
</br>18 Raise your eyes all around and see. They have all of them been collected together. They have come to you. “As I am living,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “with all of them you will clothe yourself just as with ornaments, and you will bind them on yourself like a bride.
</br>19 Although there are your devastated places and your desolated places and the land of your ruins, although now you are too cramped to be dwelling, and those swallowing you down have been far away,
</br>20 yet in your own ears the sons of your bereaved state will say, ‘The place has become too cramped for me. Do make room for me, that I may dwell.’
</br>21 And you will for certain say in your heart, ‘Who has become father to these for me, since I am a woman bereaved of children and sterile, gone into exile and taken prisoner? As for these, who has brought [them] up? Look! I myself had been left behind alone. These—where have they been?’”

</br>22 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Look! I shall raise up my hand even to the nations, and to the peoples I shall lift up my signal. And they will bring your sons in the bosom, and upon the shoulder they will carry your own daughters.
</br>23 And kings must become caretakers for you, and their princesses nursing women for you. With faces to the earth they will bow down to you, and the dust of your feet they will lick up; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah, of whom those hoping in me will not be ashamed.”

</br>24 Can those already taken be taken from a mighty man himself, or can the body of captives of the tyrant make their escape?
</br>25 But this is what Jehovah has said: “Even the body of captives of the mighty man will be taken away, and those already taken by the tyrant himself will make their escape. And against anyone contending against you I myself shall contend, and your own sons I myself shall save.
</br>26 And I will make those maltreating you eat their own flesh; and as with the sweet wine they will become drunk with their own blood. And all flesh will have to know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Repurchaser, the Powerful One of Jacob.”

</br>3 “The one slaughtering the bull is as one striking down a man. The one sacrificing the sheep is as one breaking the neck of a dog. The one offering up a gift—the blood of a pig! The one presenting a memorial of frankincense is as one saying a blessing with uncanny words. They are also the ones that have chosen their own ways, and in their disgusting things their very soul has taken a delight.
</br>4 I myself, in turn, shall choose ways of ill-treating them; and the things frightful to them I shall bring upon them; for the reason that I called, but there was no one answering; I spoke, but there were none that listened; and they kept on doing what was bad in my eyes, and the thing in which I took no delight they chose.”
<p></p>
</br>5 Hear the word of Jehovah, YOU men who are trembling at his word: “YOUR brothers that are hating YOU, that are excluding YOU by reason of my name, said, ‘May Jehovah be glorified!’ He must also appear with rejoicing on YOUR part, and they are the ones that will be put to shame.”
<p></p>
</br>6 There is a sound of uproar out of the city, a sound out of the temple! It is the sound of Jehovah repaying what is deserved to his enemies.
<p></p>
</br>7 Before she began to come into labor pains she gave birth. Before birth pangs could come to her, she even gave deliverance to a male child.
</br>8 Who has heard of a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will a land be brought forth with labor pains in one day? Or will a nation be born at one time? For Zion has come into labor pains as well as given birth to her sons.
<p></p>
</br>9 “As for me, shall I cause the breaking through and not cause the giving birth?” says Jehovah. “Or am I causing a giving birth and do I actually cause a shutting up?” your God has said.
<p></p>
</br>10 Rejoice with Jerusalem and be joyful with her, all YOU lovers of her. Exult greatly with her, all YOU keeping yourselves in mourning over her;
</br>11 for the reason that YOU will suck and certainly get satisfaction from the breast of full consolation by her; for the reason that YOU will sip and experience exquisite delight from the teat of her glory.
</br>12 For this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am extending to her peace just like a river and the glory of nations just like a flooding torrent, and YOU will certainly suck. Upon the flank YOU will be carried, and upon the knees YOU will be fondled.
</br>13 Like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting, so I myself shall keep comforting YOU people; and in the case of Jerusalem YOU will be comforted.
</br>14 And YOU will certainly see, and YOUR heart will be bound to exult, and YOUR very bones will sprout just like tender grass. And the hand of Jehovah will certainly be made known to his servants, but he will actually denounce his enemies.”
<p></p>
</br>15 “For here Jehovah himself comes as a very fire, and his chariots are like a storm wind, in order to pay back his anger with sheer rage and his rebuke with flames of fire.
</br>16 For as fire Jehovah himself will for a fact take up the controversy, yes, with his sword, against all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah will certainly become many.
</br>17 Those sanctifying themselves and cleansing themselves for the gardens behind one in the center, eating the flesh of the pig and the loathsome thing, even the jumping rodent, they will all together reach their end,” is the utterance of Jehovah.
</br>18 “And as regards their works and their thoughts, I am coming in order to collect all the nations and tongues together; and they will have to come and see my glory.”
<p></p>
</br>19 “And I will set among them a sign, and I will send some of those who are escaped to the nations, [to] Tar´shish, Pul, and Lud, those drawing the bow, Tu´bal and Ja´van, the faraway islands, who have not heard a report about me or seen my glory; and they will for certain tell about my glory among the nations.
</br>20 And they will actually bring all YOUR brothers out of all the nations as a gift to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in covered wagons and on mules and on swift she-camels, up to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,” Jehovah has said, “just as when the sons of Israel bring the gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.”
<p></p>
</br>21 “And from them also I shall take some for the priests, for the Levites,” Jehovah has said.
<p></p>
</br>22 “For just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making are standing before me,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “so the offspring of YOU people and the name of YOU people will keep standing.”
<p></p>
</br>23 “And it will certainly occur that from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh will come in to bow down before me,” Jehovah has said.
</br>24 “And they will actually go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that were transgressing against me; for the very worms upon them will not die and their fire itself will not be extinguished, and they must become something repulsive to all flesh.”
