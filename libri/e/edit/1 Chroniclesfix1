</br>4 The sons of Joel were She·mai´ah his son, Gog his son, Shim´e·i his son,
</br>5 Mi´cah his son, Re·a´iah his son, Ba´al his son,
</br>6 Be·er´ah his son, whom Til´gath-pil·ne´ser the king of As·syr´i·a took into exile, he being a chieftain of the Reu´ben·ites.
</br>7 And his brothers by their families in the genealogical enrollment by their descendants were, as the head, Je·i´el, and Zech·a·ri´ah,
</br>8 and Be´la the son of A´zaz the son of She´ma the son of Joel—he was dwelling in A·ro´er and as far as Ne´bo and Ba´al-me´on.
</br>9 Even to the east he dwelt as far as where one enters the wilderness at the river Eu·phra´tes, for their livestock itself had become numerous in the land of Gil´e·ad.
</br>10 And in the days of Saul they made war upon the Hag´rites, who came to fall by their hand; and so they dwelt in their tents throughout all the country east of Gil´e·ad.
<p></p>
</br>11 As for the sons of Gad in front of them, they dwelt in the land of Ba´shan as far as Sal´e·cah.
</br>12 Joel was the head, and Sha´pham the second, and Ja´nai and Sha´phat in Ba´shan.
</br>13 And their brothers belonging to the house of their forefathers were Mi´cha·el and Me·shul´lam and She´ba and Jo´rai and Ja´can and Zi´a and E´ber, seven.
</br>14 These were the sons of Ab´i·ha·il the son of Hu´ri, the son of Ja·ro´ah, the son of Gil´e·ad, the son of Mi´cha·el, the son of Je·shish´ai, the son of Jah´do, the son of Buz;
</br>15 A´hi the son of Ab´di·el, the son of Gu´ni, head of the house of their forefathers.
</br>16 And they continued to dwell in Gil´e·ad, in Ba´shan and in its dependent towns and in all the pasture grounds of Shar´on as far as their terminations.
</br>17 They were all of them enrolled genealogically in the days of Jo´tham the king of Judah and in the days of Jer·o·bo´am the king of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>18 As for the sons of Reu´ben and the Gad´ites and the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh; of those who were valiant fellows, men carrying shield and sword and bending the bow and trained in war, there were forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty going out to the army.
</br>19 And they began to make war upon the Hag´rites, and Je´tur and Na´phish and No´dab.
</br>20 And they came to be helped against them, so that the Hag´rites and all those who were with them were given into their hand, for it was to God that they called for aid in the war, and he let himself be entreated in their favor because they trusted in him.
</br>21 And they got to take captive their livestock, their camels fifty thousand, and sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and asses two thousand, and human souls a hundred thousand.
</br>22 For there were many that had fallen slain, because it was on the part of the [true] God that the fighting was. And they continued to dwell in their place down to the time of the exile.
<p></p>
</br>23 As for the sons of the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh, they dwelt in the land from Ba´shan to Ba´al-her´mon and Se´nir and Mount Her´mon. They themselves became numerous.
</br>24 And these were the heads of the house of their forefathers: E´pher and Ish´i and E´li·el and Az´ri·el and Jeremiah and Hod·a·vi´ah and Jah´di·el, men that were valiant, mighty fellows, men of fame, heads of the house of their forefathers.
</br>25 And they began to act unfaithfully toward the God of their forefathers and went having immoral intercourse with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had annihilated from before them.
</br>26 Consequently the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul the king of As·syr´i·a even the spirit of Til´gath-pil·ne´ser the king of As·syr´i·a, so that he took into exile those of the Reu´ben·ites and of the Gad´ites and of the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh and brought them to Ha´lah and Ha´bor and Ha´ra and the river Go´zan [to continue] until this day.

</br>4 U´thai the son of Am·mi´hud the son of Om´ri the son of Im´ri the son of Ba´ni, of the sons of Pe´rez the son of Judah.
</br>5 And of the Shi´lo·nites, A·sai´ah the firstborn and his sons.
</br>6 And of the sons of Ze´rah, Je·u´el, and six hundred and ninety brothers of theirs.
<p></p>
</br>7 And of the sons of Benjamin, Sal´lu the son of Me·shul´lam the son of Hod·a·vi´ah the son of Has·se·nu´ah,
</br>8 and Ib·ne´iah the son of Je·ro´ham, and E´lah the son of Uz´zi the son of Mich´ri, and Me·shul´lam the son of Sheph·a·ti´ah the son of Reu´el the son of Ib·ni´jah.
</br>9 And the brothers of theirs by their descendants were nine hundred and fifty-six. All these were men that were heads of the fathers by the house of their forefathers.
<p></p>
</br>10 And of the priests there were Je·da´iah and Je·hoi´a·rib and Ja´chin,
</br>11 and Az·a·ri´ah the son of Hil·ki´ah the son of Me·shul´lam the son of Za´dok the son of Me·ra´ioth the son of A·hi´tub, a leader of the house of the [true] God,
</br>12 and A·dai´ah the son of Je·ro´ham the son of Pash´hur the son of Mal·chi´jah, and Ma´a·sai the son of Ad´i·el the son of Jah´ze·rah the son of Me·shul´lam the son of Me·shil´le·mith the son of Im´mer,
</br>13 and their brothers, heads of the house of their forefathers, a thousand seven hundred and sixty, mighty men of ability for the work of the service of the house of the [true] God.
<p></p>
</br>14 And of the Levites there were She·mai´ah the son of Has´shub the son of Az·ri´kam the son of Hash·a·bi´ah from the sons of Me·rar´i;
</br>15 and Bak·bak´kar, He´resh and Ga´lal, and Mat·ta·ni´ah the son of Mi´ca the son of Zich´ri the son of A´saph,
</br>16 and O·ba·di´ah the son of She·mai´ah the son of Ga´lal the son of Je·du´thun, and Ber·e·chi´ah the son of A´sa the son of El·ka´nah, who was dwelling in the settlements of the Ne·toph´a·thites.
<p></p>
</br>17 And the gatekeepers were Shal´lum and Ak´kub and Tal´mon and A·hi´man and their brother Shal´lum the head,
</br>18 and up till then he was in the king’s gate to the east. These were the gatekeepers of the camps of the sons of Le´vi.
</br>19 And Shal´lum the son of Ko´re the son of E·bi´a·saph the son of Ko´rah and his brothers of the house of his father the Ko´rah·ites, over the work of the service, the doorkeepers of the tent, and their fathers over the camp of Jehovah, the keepers of the entryway.
</br>20 And it was Phin´e·has the son of El·e·a´zar that happened to be leader over them in the past. Jehovah was with him.
</br>21 Zech·a·ri´ah the son of Me·shel·e·mi´ah was the gatekeeper of the entrance of the tent of meeting.
<p></p>
</br>22 All of them who were selected as gatekeepers at the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. They were in their settlements by their genealogical enrollment. These David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust.
</br>23 And they and their sons were over the gates of the house of Jehovah, even the house of the tent, for guard service.
</br>24 It was to the four directions that the gatekeepers came to be, to the east, to the west, to the north and to the south.
</br>25 And their brothers in their settlements were to come in for seven days, from time to time, along with these.
</br>26 For in office of trust there were four mighty men of the gatekeepers. They were Levites, and they proved to be in charge of the dining rooms and of the treasures of the house of the [true] God.
</br>27 And all around the house of the [true] God they would spend the night; for guard service was upon them, and they were in charge of the key, even [to open up] from morning to morning.
<p></p>
</br>28 And some of them were in charge of the utensils of the service, for it was by number that they would bring them in and it was by number that they would take them out.
</br>29 And some of them were men appointed over the utensils and over all the holy utensils and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the frankincense and the balsam oil.
</br>30 And some of the sons of the priests were makers of the ointment mixture of balsam oil.
</br>31 And Mat·ti·thi´ah of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shal´lum the Ko´rah·ite, was in the office of trust over the things baked in pans.
</br>32 And some of the sons of the Ko´hath·ites, their brothers, were in charge of the layer bread, to prepare it sabbath by sabbath.
<p></p>
</br>33 And these were the singers, the heads of the fathers of the Levites in the dining rooms, those set free from duty; for by day and by night it was their responsibility to be in the work.
</br>34 These were the heads of the fathers of the Levites by their descendants, headmen. These were the ones that dwelt in Jerusalem.
<p></p>
</br>35 And in Gib´e·on was where the father of Gib´e·on, Je·i´el, dwelt. And his wife’s name was Ma´a·cah.
</br>36 And his son, the firstborn, was Ab´don, and Zur and Kish and Ba´al and Ner and Na´dab,
</br>37 and Ge´dor and A·hi´o and Zech·a·ri´ah and Mik´loth.
</br>38 As for Mik´loth, he became father to Shim´e·am. And it was really they that dwelt in front of their brothers in Jerusalem along with brothers of theirs.
</br>39 As for Ner, he became father to Kish; Kish, in turn, became father to Saul; Saul, in turn, became father to Jon´a·than and Mal´chi-shu´a and A·bin´a·dab and Esh·ba´al.
</br>40 And the son of Jon´a·than was Mer´ib-ba´al. As for Mer´ib-ba´al, he became father to Mi´cah.
</br>41 And the sons of Mi´cah were Pi´thon and Mel´ech and Tahr´e·a [and A´haz].
</br>42 As for A´haz, he became father to Ja´rah; Ja´rah, in turn, became father to Al´e·meth and Az´ma·veth and Zim´ri. Zim´ri, in turn, became father to Mo´za.
</br>43 As for Mo´za, he became father to Bin´e·a and Re·pha´iah his son, El·e·a´sah his son, A´zel his son.
</br>44 And A´zel had six sons, and these were their names: Az·ri´kam, Bo´che·ru and Ish´ma·el and She·a·ri´ah and O·ba·di´ah and Ha´nan. These were the sons of A´zel.

</br>1 And the Phi·lis´tines, for their part, made war upon Israel; and the men of Israel went fleeing from before the Phi·lis´tines and kept falling slain in Mount Gil·bo´a.
</br>2 And the Phi·lis´tines kept in close range of Saul and his sons; and the Phi·lis´tines got to strike down Jon´a·than and A·bin´a·dab and Mal´chi-shu´a, sons of Saul.
</br>3 And the fighting became heavy against Saul; and those shooting with the bow finally found him, and he got wounded by the shooters.
</br>4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer: “Draw your sword and run me through with it, that these uncircumcised men may not come and certainly deal abusively with me.” And his armor-bearer was unwilling, because he was very much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell upon it.
</br>5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul had died, then he too fell upon the sword and died.
</br>6 Thus Saul and three sons of his died, and all those of his house died together.
</br>7 When all the men of Israel that were in the low plain saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, then they began to leave their cities and flee; after which the Phi·lis´tines came on in and took up dwelling in them.
<p></p>
</br>8 And it came about the next day that, when the Phi·lis´tines came to strip the slain, they got to find Saul and his sons fallen upon Mount Gil·bo´a.
</br>9 And they proceeded to strip him and take off his head and his armor and send into the land of the Phi·lis´tines all around to inform their idols and the people.
</br>10 Finally they put his armor in the house of their god, and his skull they fastened to the house of Da´gon.
<p></p>
</br>11 And all those of Ja´besh in Gil´e·ad got to hear of all that the Phi·lis´tines had done to Saul.
</br>12 So all the valiant men rose up and carried off the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons and brought them to Ja´besh and buried their bones under the big tree in Ja´besh; and they went fasting for seven days.
<p></p>
</br>13 Thus Saul died for his unfaithfulness with which he had acted faithlessly against Jehovah concerning the word of Jehovah that he had not kept and also for asking of a spirit medium to make inquiry.
</br>14 And he did not inquire of Jehovah. Consequently he put him to death and turned the kingship over to David the son of Jes´se.

</br>1 In time all the Israelites collected themselves together to David at He´bron, saying: “Look! We are your bone and your flesh.
</br>2 Both yesterday and previously, even while Saul happened to be king, you were the one leading Israel out and bringing it in; and Jehovah your God proceeded to say to you, ‘You yourself will shepherd my people Israel, and you yourself will become leader over my people Israel.’”
</br>3 So all the older men of Israel came to the king at He´bron and David concluded a covenant with them in He´bron before Jehovah; after which they anointed David as king over Israel, according to Jehovah’s word by means of Samuel.
<p></p>
</br>4 Later David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is to say, Je´bus, where the Jeb´u·sites were the inhabitants of the land.
</br>5 And the inhabitants of Je´bus began to say to David: “You will not come in here.” Just the same, David proceeded to capture the stronghold of Zion, that is to say, the City of David.
</br>6 So David said: “Anyone striking the Jeb´u·sites first, he will become head and prince.” And Jo´ab the son of Ze·ru´iah got to go up first, and he came to be head.
</br>7 And David took up dwelling in the place difficult to approach. That is why they called it the City of David.
</br>8 And he began to build the city all around, from the Mound even to the parts round about, but Jo´ab himself brought to life the rest of the city.
</br>9 And David went on getting greater and greater, for Jehovah of armies was with him.
<p></p>
</br>10 Now these are the heads of the mighty men that belonged to David, holding strongly with him in his kingship together with all Israel, to make him king according to Jehovah’s word concerning Israel.
</br>11 And this is the list of the mighty men that belonged to David: Ja·sho´be·am the son of a Hach´mon·ite, the head of the three. He was brandishing his spear over three hundred slain at one time.
</br>12 And after him there was El·e·a´zar the son of Do´do the A·ho´hite. He was among the three mighty men.
</br>13 He it was that happened to be with David at Pas-dam´mim, where the Phi·lis´tines had gathered themselves together for war. Now there happened to be a tract of the field full of barley, and the people, for their part, had fled because of the Phi·lis´tines.
</br>14 But he took his stand in the middle of the tract and delivered it, and kept striking down the Phi·lis´tines, so that Jehovah saved with a great salvation.
<p></p>
</br>15 And three of the thirty head ones proceeded to go down to the rock, to David at the cave of A·dul´lam, while a camp of the Phi·lis´tines was camping in the low plain of Reph´a·im.
</br>16 And David was then in the place hard to approach; and a garrison of the Phi·lis´tines was then in Beth´le·hem.
</br>17 After a while David showed his craving and said: “O that I might have a drink of the water from the cistern of Beth´le·hem, which is at the gate!”
</br>18 At that the three forced their way into the camp of the Phi·lis´tines and drew water from the cistern of Beth´le·hem, which is at the gate, and came carrying and bringing it to David. And David did not consent to drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.
</br>19 And he went on to say: “It is unthinkable on my part, as regards my God, to do this! Is it the blood of these men that I should drink at the risk of their souls? For it was at the risk of their souls that they brought it.” And he did not consent to drink it. These are the things that the three mighty men did.
<p></p>
</br>20 As for A·bish´ai the brother of Jo´ab, he himself became head of the three; and he was brandishing his spear over three hundred slain, and he had a reputation like the three.
</br>21 Of the three he was more distinguished than the two others, and he came to be a chief to them; and yet he did not come up to the [first] three.
<p></p>
</br>22 As for Be·nai´ah the son of Je·hoi´a·da, the son of a valiant man, who did many deeds in Kab´ze·el, he himself struck down the two [sons] of Ar´i·el of Mo´ab; and he himself descended and struck down a lion inside a waterpit in the day of snowfall.
</br>23 And he it was that struck down the Egyptian man, a man of extraordinary size, of five cubits. And in the hand of the Egyptian there was a spear like the beam of loom workers; yet he went on down to him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
</br>24 These things Be·nai´ah the son of Je·hoi´a·da did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.
</br>25 Although he was more distinguished than the thirty, yet to the rank of the [first] three he did not come. However, David put him over his own bodyguard.
<p></p>
</br>26 As for the mighty men of the military forces, there were As´a·hel the brother of Jo´ab, El·ha´nan the son of Do´do of Beth´le·hem,

</br>1 And these are the ones that came to David at Zik´lag while he was still under restrictions because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, the helpers in the warfare,
</br>2 armed with the bow, using the right hand and using the left hand with stones or with arrows in the bow. They were of the brothers of Saul, of Benjamin.
</br>3 There was the head A·hi·e´zer and Jo´ash the sons of She·ma´ah the Gib´e·ath·ite, and Je´zi·el and Pel´et the sons of Az´ma·veth, and Ber´a·cah and Je´hu the An´a·thoth·ite,

</br>7 and Jo·e´lah and Zeb·a·di´ah the sons of Je·ro´ham of Ge´dor.
<p></p>
</br>8 And there were some of the Gad´ites that separated themselves to David’s side at the place difficult to approach in the wilderness, valiant, mighty men, army men for the war, keeping the large shield and the lance ready, whose faces were the faces of lions, and they were like the gazelles upon the mountains for speed.
</br>9 E´zer was the head, O·ba·di´ah the second, E·li´ab the third,
</br>10 Mish·man´nah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
</br>11 At´tai the sixth, E´li·el the seventh,
</br>12 Jo·ha´nan the eighth, El·za´bad the ninth,
</br>13 Jeremiah the tenth, Mach´ban·nai the eleventh.
</br>14 These were of the sons of Gad, heads of the army. The least one was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.
</br>15 These are the ones that crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they then chased away all those of the low plains, to the east and to the west.
<p></p>
</br>16 And some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah proceeded to come clear to the place difficult to approach, to David.
</br>17 Then David went out before them and answered and said to them: “If it is for peace that YOU have come to me to help me, my own heart will become at unity with YOU. But if it is to betray me to my adversaries when there is no wrong on my palms, let the God of our forefathers see to it and set it in order.”
</br>18 And spirit itself enveloped A·ma´sai, the head of the thirty:

So David received them and put them among the heads of the troops.

</br>19 And there were some of Ma·nas´seh that deserted to David when he came with the Phi·lis´tines against Saul for battle; but he did not help them, for on counsel the axis lords of the Phi·lis´tines sent him away, saying: “At the risk of our own heads he will desert to his lord Saul.”
</br>20 When he came to Zik´lag there deserted to him from Ma·nas´seh Ad´nah and Jo´za·bad and Je·di´a·el and Mi´cha·el and Jo´za·bad and E·li´hu and Zil´le·thai, heads of the thousands that belonged to Ma·nas´seh.
</br>21 And they, for their part, were of help to David against the marauder band, because all of them were mighty men of valor, and they came to be chiefs in the army;
</br>22 for day by day people kept coming to David to help him, until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.
<p></p>
</br>23 And these were the numbers of the heads of those equipped for the army that came to David at He´bron to turn the kingship of Saul over to him according to Jehovah’s order.

</br>25 Of the sons of Sim´e·on the mighty men of valor of the army were seven thousand one hundred.
<p></p>
</br>26 Of the sons of the Levites four thousand six hundred.
</br>27 And Je·hoi´a·da was the leader [of the sons] of Aaron, and with him there were three thousand seven hundred.
</br>28 Also Za´dok a young man, mighty in valor, and the house of his forefathers, twenty-two chiefs.
<p></p>
</br>29 And of the sons of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, there were three thousand, and up till then the greater number of them were keeping strict watch of the house of Saul.
</br>30 And of the sons of E´phra·im there were twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, men of fame, by the house of their forefathers.
<p></p>
</br>31 And of the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh there were eighteen thousand that had been designated by name to come to make David king.
</br>32 And of the sons of Is´sa·char having a knowledge of how to discern the times to know what Israel ought to do, there were two hundred head ones of theirs, and all their brothers were at their orders.
</br>33 Of Zeb´u·lun those going out to the army, drawing up in battle formation with all the weapons of war, there were fifty thousand, and for flocking together [to David] they were not of a double heart.
</br>34 And of Naph´ta·li there were a thousand chiefs, and with them with the large shield and the spear there were thirty-seven thousand.
</br>35 And of the Dan´ites those drawing up in battle formation were twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
</br>36 And of Ash´er those going out to the army for drawing up in battle formation were forty thousand.

</br>37 And from across the Jordan of the Reu´ben·ites and the Gad´ites and the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh with all the weapons of the military army there were a hundred and twenty thousand.
</br>38 All these were men of war, flocking together in battle line; with a complete heart they came to He´bron to make David king over all Israel; and also all the remainder of Israel were of one heart for making David king.
</br>39 And they continued there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
</br>40 And also those near to them, as far as Is´sa·char and Zeb´u·lun and Naph´ta·li, were bringing food upon asses and upon camels and upon mules and upon cattle, eatables of flour, cakes of pressed figs and cakes of raisins and wine and oil and cattle and sheep in great quantity, for there was rejoicing in Israel.

</br>3 And let us bring the ark of our God around to ourselves.” For they had not cared for it in the days of Saul.
</br>4 So all the congregation said to do that way, for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people.
</br>5 Accordingly David congregated all Israel from the river of Egypt as far as the entering of Ha´math, to bring the ark of the [true] God from Kir´i·ath-je´a·rim.

</br>6 And David and all Israel proceeded to go up to Ba´al·ah, to Kir´i·ath-je´a·rim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of the [true] God, Jehovah, sitting on the cherubs, where [his] name is called on.
</br>7 However, they had the ark of the [true] God ride upon a new wagon from the house of A·bin´a·dab, and Uz´zah and A·hi´o were leading the wagon.

</br>9 And they came gradually as far as the threshing floor of Chi´don, and Uz´zah now thrust his hand out to grab hold of the Ark, for the bulls nearly caused an upset.
</br>10 At that Jehovah’s anger blazed against Uz´zah, so that he struck him down because he had thrust his hand out upon the Ark, and he died there before God.
</br>11 And David became angry because Jehovah had broken through in a rupture against Uz´zah; and that place came to be called Pe´rez-uz´zah down to this day.
<p></p>
</br>12 And David became afraid of the [true] God on that day, saying: “How shall I bring the ark of the [true] God to me?”
</br>13 And David did not remove the Ark to himself at the City of David, but he carried it aside to the house of O´bed-e´dom the Git´tite.

</br>9 And the Phi·lis´tines, for their part, came in and kept making raids in the low plain of Reph´a·im.
</br>10 And David began to inquire of God, saying: “Shall I go up against the Phi·lis´tines, and will you certainly give them into my hand?” At this Jehovah said to him: “Go up, and I shall certainly give them into your hand.”
</br>11 So David went up to Ba´al-pe·ra´zim and there got to strike them down. At that David said: “The [true] God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a gap made by waters.” That is why they called the name of that place Ba´al-pe·ra´zim.
</br>12 Consequently they left their gods there. Then David said [the word], and so they were burned in the fire.
<p></p>
</br>13 Later the Phi·lis´tines once again made a raid in the low plain.
</br>14 At that David inquired again of God, and the [true] God now said to him: “You must not go up after them. Go around from directly against them, and you must come at them in front of the ba´ca bushes.
</br>15 And let it occur that, when you hear the sound of the marching in the tops of the ba´ca bushes, then you go out into the fight, because the [true] God will have gone out before you to strike the camp of the Phi·lis´tines down.”
</br>16 So David did just as the [true] God had commanded him, and they went striking down the camp of the Phi·lis´tines from Gib´e·on to Ge´zer.
</br>17 And David’s fame began to go out into all the lands, and Jehovah himself put the dread of him upon all the nations.

</br>1 And he continued building houses for himself in the City of David; and he went on to prepare a place for the ark of the [true] God and pitch a tent for it.
</br>2 It was then that David said: “No one is to carry the ark of the [true] God but the Levites, for they are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to carry the ark of Jehovah and to minister to him to time indefinite.”
</br>3 Then David congregated all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of Jehovah up to its place that he had prepared for it.
<p></p>
</br>4 And David proceeded to gather the sons of Aaron and the Levites;
</br>5 of the sons of Ko´hath, U·ri´el the chief and his brothers, a hundred and twenty;
</br>6 of the sons of Me·rar´i, A·sai´ah the chief and his brothers, two hundred and twenty;
</br>7 of the sons of Ger´shom, Joel the chief and his brothers, a hundred and thirty;
</br>8 of the sons of E·li·za´phan, She·mai´ah the chief and his brothers, two hundred;
</br>9 of the sons of He´bron, E´li·el the chief and his brothers, eighty;
</br>10 of the sons of Uz´zi·el, Am·min´a·dab the chief and his brothers, a hundred and twelve.
</br>11 Furthermore, David called Za´dok and A·bi´a·thar the priests, and the Levites U·ri´el, A·sai´ah and Joel, She·mai´ah and E´li·el and Am·min´a·dab,
</br>12 and he went on to say to them: “YOU are the heads of the fathers of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, YOU and YOUR brothers, and YOU must bring the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel up to the place that I have prepared for it.
</br>13 Because at the first time YOU did not, Jehovah our God broke through against us, for we did not search after him according to the custom.”
</br>14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>15 Then the sons of the Levites began to carry the ark of the [true] God, just as Moses had commanded by Jehovah’s word, upon their shoulders with the rods upon them.
</br>16 David now said to the chiefs of the Levites to station their brothers the singers with the instruments of song, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, playing aloud to cause a sound of rejoicing to arise.
<p></p>
</br>17 Accordingly the Levites stationed He´man the son of Joel and, of his brothers, A´saph the son of Ber·e·chi´ah; and, of the sons of Me·rar´i their brothers, E´than the son of Kush·a´iah;
</br>18 and with them their brothers of the second division, Zech·a·ri´ah, Ben and Ja·a´zi·el and She·mir´a·moth and Je·hi´el and Un´ni, E·li´ab and Be·nai´ah and Ma·a·sei´ah and Mat·ti·thi´ah and E·liph´e·le·hu and Mik·ne´iah, and O´bed-e´dom and Je·i´el the gatekeepers,
</br>19 and the singers He´man, A´saph and E´than, with the copper cymbals to play aloud;
</br>20 and Zech·a·ri´ah and A´zi·el and She·mir´a·moth and Je·hi´el and Un´ni and E·li´ab and Ma·a·sei´ah and Be·nai´ah with stringed instruments tuned to Al´a·moth,
</br>21 and Mat·ti·thi´ah and E·liph´e·le·hu and Mik·ne´iah and O´bed-e´dom and Je·i´el and Az·a·zi´ah with harps tuned to Shem´i·nith, to act as directors;
</br>22 and Chen·a·ni´ah the chief of the Levites in carrying, he giving instruction in carrying, for he was expert;
</br>23 and Ber·e·chi´ah and El·ka´nah the gatekeepers for the Ark;
</br>24 and Sheb·a·ni´ah and Josh´a·phat and Ne·than´el and A·ma´sai and Zech·a·ri´ah and Be·nai´ah and E·li·e´zer the priests loudly sounding the trumpets before the ark of the [true] God, and O´bed-e´dom and Je·hi´ah the gatekeepers for the Ark.
<p></p>
</br>25 And David and the older men of Israel and the chiefs of the thousands came to be the ones walking along to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of O´bed-e´dom with rejoicing.
</br>26 And it came about when the [true] God helped the Levites while carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah that they proceeded to sacrifice seven young bulls and seven rams.
</br>27 And David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, and also all the Levites carrying the Ark and the singers and Chen·a·ni´ah the chief of the carrying by the singers; but upon David there was an eph´od of linen.
</br>28 And all the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting and with the sounding of the horn and with trumpets and with cymbals, playing aloud on stringed instruments and harps.
<p></p>
</br>29 And it came about that, when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came as far as the City of David, Mi´chal, Saul’s daughter, herself looked down through the window and got to see King David skipping about and celebrating; and she began to despise him in her heart.

</br>1 Thus they brought the ark of the [true] God in and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and they began to present burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before the [true] God.
</br>2 When David finished offering up the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices, he went on to bless the people in the name of Jehovah.
</br>3 Further, he apportioned to all the Israelites, man as well as woman, to each one a round loaf of bread and a date cake and a raisin cake.
</br>4 Then he put before the ark of Jehovah some of the Levites as ministers, both to call to remembrance and to thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel,

</br>1 And it came about that as soon as David had begun dwelling in his own house, David proceeded to say to Nathan the prophet: “Here I am dwelling in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under tent cloths.”
</br>2 Upon that Nathan said to David: “Everything that is in your heart do, for the [true] God is with you.”
<p></p>
</br>3 And it came about on that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
</br>4 “Go, and you must say to David my servant, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “It will not be you that will build me the house in which to dwell.
</br>5 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought Israel up until this day, but I continued from tent to tent and from one tabernacle [to another].
</br>6 During all the time that I walked about in all Israel, did I speak a single word with one of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, ‘Why have YOU men not built me a house of cedars?’”’
<p></p>
</br>7 “And now this is what you will say to my servant David, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “I myself took you from the pasture ground from following the flock to become a leader over my people Israel.
</br>8 And I shall prove to be with you wherever you do walk, and I shall cut off all your enemies from before you, and I shall certainly make for you a name like the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.
</br>9 And I shall certainly appoint a place for my people Israel and plant them, and they will indeed reside where they are and no more will they be disturbed; and the sons of unrighteousness will not wear them out again, just as they did at the first,
</br>10 even since the days that I put judges in command over my people Israel. And I shall certainly humble all your enemies. And I tell you, ‘Also a house Jehovah will build for you.’
<p></p>
</br>11 “‘“And it must occur that when your days have come to the full [for you] to go [to be] with your forefathers, I shall certainly raise up your seed after you that will come to be one of your sons, and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingship.
</br>12 He is the one that will build me a house, and I shall certainly establish his throne firmly to time indefinite.
</br>13 I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son; and my loving-kindness I shall not remove from him the way I removed it from the one that happened to be prior to you.
</br>14 And I will cause him to stand in my house and in my kingship to time indefinite, and his throne will itself become one lasting to time indefinite.”’”
<p></p>
</br>15 According to all these words and according to all this vision was the way that Nathan spoke to David.
<p></p>
</br>16 After that King David came in and sat down before Jehovah and said: “Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house that you have brought me thus far?
</br>17 As though this should be something little in your eyes, O God, yet you speak concerning the house of your servant down to a distant future time, and you have looked on me according to the opportunity of the man in the ascendancy, O Jehovah God.
</br>18 What more could David say to you as to honoring your servant, when you yourself know your servant well?
</br>19 O Jehovah, for the sake of your servant and in agreement with your own heart you have done all these great things by making all the great achievements known.
</br>20 O Jehovah, there is none like you, and there is no God except you in connection with all that we have heard with our ears.
</br>21 And what other nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom the [true] God went to redeem to himself as a people, to assign to yourself a name of great achievements and fear-inspiring things by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed from Egypt?
</br>22 And you proceeded to constitute your people Israel as your people to time indefinite, and you yourself, O Jehovah, became their God.
</br>23 And now, O Jehovah, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house prove faithful to time indefinite, and do just as you have spoken.
</br>24 And let your name prove faithful and become great to time indefinite, saying, ‘Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, is God to Israel,’ and let the house of David your servant be one lasting before you.
</br>25 For you yourself, my God, have revealed to your servant the purpose to build him a house. That is why your servant has found occasion to pray before you.
</br>26 And now, O Jehovah, you are the [true] God, and you promise this goodness concerning your servant.

</br>3 And David went on to strike down Had·ad·e´zer the king of Zo´bah at Ha´math as he was going his way to set up his control at the river Eu·phra´tes.
</br>4 Further, David captured from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand men on foot. Then David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but he let a hundred chariot horses of them remain.

</br>7 Moreover, David took the circular shields of gold that happened to be on the servants of Had·ad·e´zer and brought them to Jerusalem.
</br>8 And from Tib´hath and Cun, cities of Had·ad·e´zer, David took very much copper. With it Sol´o·mon made the copper sea and the pillars and the copper utensils.

</br>2 At that David said: “I shall exercise loving-kindness toward Ha´nun the son of Na´hash, because his father exercised loving-kindness toward me.” Accordingly David sent messengers to comfort him over his father, and the servants of David proceeded to come into the land of the sons of Am´mon to Ha´nun to comfort him.
</br>3 However, the princes of the sons of Am´mon said to Ha´nun: “Is David honoring your father in your eyes in that he has sent comforters to you? Is it not for the sake of making a thorough search and causing an overthrow and for spying out the land that his servants have come in to you?”
</br>4 So Ha´nun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut their garments in half to their buttocks and sent them away.
</br>5 Later people went and told David about the men; and he at once sent to meet them, because they had become men very much humiliated; and the king went on to say: “Dwell in Jer´i·cho until YOUR beards grow abundantly. Then YOU must return.”
<p></p>
</br>6 In time the sons of Am´mon saw that they had become foul-smelling to David, and Ha´nun and the sons of Am´mon proceeded to send a thousand silver talents to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mes·o·po·ta´mi·a and from A´ram-ma´a·cah and from Zo´bah.
</br>7 Thus they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Ma´a·cah and his people. Then they came in and camped before Med´e·ba; and as for the sons of Am´mon, they gathered together from their cities and now came in for the war.

</br>8 When David heard of it, he immediately sent Jo´ab and all the army [and] the mighty men.
</br>9 And the sons of Am´mon began to go out and draw up in battle formation at the entrance of the city, and the kings that had come were by themselves in the open field.

</br>10 When Jo´ab saw that the battle charges had come to be against him from the front and from the rear, he at once chose some of all the choice men in Israel and drew them up in formation to meet the Syrians.
</br>11 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of A·bish´ai his brother, that they might draw up in formation to meet the sons of Am´mon.
</br>12 And he went on to say: “If the Syrians become too strong for me, you must also serve as a salvation for me; but if the sons of Am´mon themselves become too strong for you, I must also save you.
</br>13 Be strong, that we may show ourselves courageous in behalf of our people and in behalf of the cities of our God; and as for Jehovah, what is good in his own eyes he will do.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then Jo´ab and the people that were with him advanced before the Syrians to the battle, and they took to flight from before him.
</br>15 As for the sons of Am´mon, they saw that the Syrians had fled, and they themselves also took to flight from before A·bish´ai his brother and then came into the city. Later Jo´ab came into Jerusalem.

</br>17 When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up in formation against them. When David drew up in battle formation to meet the Syrians, they began to fight against him.
</br>18 But the Syrians took to flight because of Israel; and David went killing of the Syrians seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand men on foot, and Sho´phach the chief of the army himself he put to death.

</br>2 So David said to Jo´ab and the chiefs of the people: “Go, count Israel from Be´er-she´ba to Dan and bring it to me that I may know their number.”
</br>3 But Jo´ab said: “May Jehovah add to his people a hundred times as many as they are. Do they not, O my lord the king, all of them belong to my lord as servants? Why does my lord seek this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?”
<p></p>
</br>4 The king’s word, however, prevailed over Jo´ab, so that Jo´ab went out and walked through all Israel, after which he came to Jerusalem.
</br>5 Jo´ab now gave the number of the registration of the people to David; and all Israel amounted to a million one hundred thousand men drawing sword, and Judah four hundred and seventy thousand men drawing sword.
</br>6 And Le´vi and Benjamin he did not register in among them, because the king’s word had been detestable to Jo´ab.

</br>10 “Go, and you must speak to David, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “There are three things that I am directing against you. Choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”
</br>11 Accordingly Gad went in to David and said to him: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Take your pick,
</br>12 whether for three years there is to be a famine; or for three months there is to be a sweeping away from before your adversaries and for the sword of your enemies to overtake [you], or for three days there is to be the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence, in the land, with Jehovah’s angel bringing ruin in all the territory of Israel.’ And now see what I should reply to the One sending me.”
</br>13 So David said to Gad: “It is very distressing to me. Please, let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for very many are his mercies; but into the hand of man do not let me fall.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then Jehovah gave a pestilence in Israel, so that out of Israel seventy thousand persons fell.
</br>15 Moreover, the [true] God sent an angel to Jerusalem to bring ruin to it; and as soon as he began bringing the ruin, Jehovah saw it and began to feel regret over the calamity; and so he said to the angel that was bringing the ruin: “It is enough! Now let your hand drop.” And Jehovah’s angel was standing close by the threshing floor of Or´nan the Jeb´u·site.

</br>16 When David raised his eyes, he got to see Jehovah’s angel standing between the earth and the heavens with his drawn sword in his hand extended toward Jerusalem; and David and the older men, covered with sackcloth, at once fell down upon their faces.
</br>17 And David proceeded to say to the [true] God: “Was it not I that said to make a numbering of the people, and is it not I that have sinned and have unquestionably done bad? As for these sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let your hand, please, come to be upon me and my father’s house; but not upon your people, for a scourge.”
<p></p>
</br>18 And Jehovah’s angel, for his part, said to Gad to say to David that David should go up to erect an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Or´nan the Jeb´u·site.
</br>19 Accordingly David went up at the word of Gad that he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.
</br>20 Meantime, Or´nan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons with him were hiding themselves. Now Or´nan had been threshing wheat.
</br>21 So David came as far as Or´nan. When Or´nan looked and saw David, he immediately went out of the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the earth.
</br>22 Then David said to Or´nan: “Do give me the place of the threshing floor, that I may build in it an altar to Jehovah. For the money in full give it to me, that the scourge may be halted from upon the people.”
</br>23 But Or´nan said to David: “Take it as your own, and let my lord the king do what is good in his own eyes. See, I do give the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering. The whole I do give.”
<p></p>
</br>24 However, King David said to Or´nan: “No, but without fail I shall make the purchase for the money in full, because I shall not carry what is yours to Jehovah to offer up burnt sacrifices without cost.”
</br>25 So David gave Or´nan for the place gold shekels to the weight of six hundred.
</br>26 Then David built there an altar to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices, and he proceeded to call upon Jehovah, who now answered him with fire from the heavens upon the altar of burnt offering.
</br>27 Moreover, Jehovah said the word to the angel, who accordingly returned his sword to its sheath.
</br>28 At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Or´nan the Jeb´u·site, he continued to sacrifice there.
</br>29 But the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gib´e·on.
</br>30 And David had not been able to go before it to consult God, for he had been terrified because of the sword of Jehovah’s angel.

</br>1 Then David said: “This is the house of Jehovah the [true] God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.”
<p></p>
</br>2 David now said to bring together the alien residents that were in the land of Israel, and then he set them as stone hewers to hew squared stones for building the house of the [true] God.
</br>3 And iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps David prepared, and also copper in such quantity as to be beyond weighing,
</br>4 and also cedar timbers without number; for the Si·do´ni·ans and the Tyr´i·ans brought in cedar timbers in great quantity to David.
</br>5 Accordingly David said: “Sol´o·mon my son is young and delicate, and the house to be built to Jehovah is to be surpassingly magnificent for beauteous distinction to all the lands. Let me, then, make preparation for him.” So David made preparation in great quantities before his death.
<p></p>
</br>6 Moreover, he called Sol´o·mon his son that he might command him to build a house to Jehovah the God of Israel.
</br>7 And David went on to say to Sol´o·mon his son: “As for myself, it became close to my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.
</br>8 But Jehovah’s word came against me, saying, ‘Blood in great quantity you have spilled, and great wars you have waged. You will not build a house to my name, for a great deal of blood you have spilled on the earth before me.
</br>9 Look! There is a son being born to you. He himself will prove to be a restful man, and I shall certainly give him rest from all his enemies all around; for Sol´o·mon is what his name will become, and peace and quietness I shall bestow upon Israel in his days.
</br>10 It is he that will build a house to my name, and he himself will become a son to me, and I a father to him. And I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingship firmly over Israel to time indefinite.’
<p></p>
</br>11 “Now, my son, may Jehovah prove to be with you, and you must prove successful and build the house of Jehovah your God, just as he has spoken concerning you.
</br>12 Only may Jehovah give you discretion and understanding, and may he give you commandment concerning Israel even to keep the law of Jehovah your God.
</br>13 In that case you will prove successful if you take care to carry out the regulations and the judicial decisions that Jehovah commanded Moses respecting Israel. Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified.
</br>14 And here during my affliction I have prepared for Jehovah’s house a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver, and the copper and the iron there is no means of weighing because they have come to be in such quantity; and timbers and stones I have prepared, but to them you will make additions.
</br>15 And with you there are in great number doers of work, stone hewers and workers in stone and wood and every one skillful in every sort of work.
</br>16 The gold, the silver and the copper and the iron there is no means of numbering. Rise and act, and may Jehovah prove to be with you.”
<p></p>
</br>17 And David went on to command all the princes of Israel to help Sol´o·mon his son:
</br>18 “Is not Jehovah YOUR God with YOU, and has he not given YOU rest all around? For he has given into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before his people.
</br>19 Now set YOUR heart and YOUR soul to inquire after Jehovah YOUR God, and rise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah the [true] God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy utensils of the [true] God to the house built to the name of Jehovah.”

</br>1 And David himself had grown old and satisfied with days, and so he made Sol´o·mon his son king over Israel.
</br>2 And he proceeded to gather all the princes of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
</br>3 Accordingly the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years upward; and their number, head by head of them, able-bodied man by able-bodied man, came to be thirty-eight thousand.
</br>4 Of these for acting as supervisors over the work of the house of Jehovah there were twenty-four thousand; and as officers and judges six thousand;
</br>5 and four thousand gatekeepers and four thousand givers of praise to Jehovah on the instruments that [David said] “I have made for giving praise.”
<p></p>
</br>6 Then David distributed them in divisions to the sons of Le´vi, to Ger´shon, Ko´hath and Me·rar´i.
</br>7 To the Ger´shon·ites, La´dan and Shim´e·i.
</br>8 The sons of La´dan were Je·hi´el the headman and Ze´tham and Joel, three.
</br>9 The sons of Shim´e·i were She·lo´moth and Ha´zi·el and Ha´ran, three. These were the heads of the fathers for La´dan.
</br>10 And the sons of Shim´e·i were Ja´hath, Zi´na and Je´ush and Be·ri´ah. These four were the sons of Shim´e·i.
</br>11 And Ja´hath came to be the head, and Zi´zah the second. As for Je´ush and Be·ri´ah, they did not have many sons; so they became a paternal house for one official class.
<p></p>
</br>12 The sons of Ko´hath were Am´ram, Iz´har, He´bron and Uz´zi·el, four.
</br>13 The sons of Am´ram were Aaron and Moses. But Aaron was separated that he might sanctify the Most Holy, he and his sons to time indefinite, to make sacrificial smoke before Jehovah, to minister to him and to pronounce blessing in his name to time indefinite.
</br>14 As for Moses the man of the [true] God, his sons themselves continued to be called among the tribe of the Levites.
</br>15 The sons of Moses were Ger´shom and E·li·e´zer.
</br>16 The sons of Ger´shom were Sheb´u·el the head.
</br>17 And the sons of E·li·e´zer came to be Re·ha·bi´ah the head; and E·li·e´zer did not come to have other sons, but the sons of Re·ha·bi´ah did themselves become exceedingly many.
</br>18 The sons of Iz´har were She·lo´mith the headman.
</br>19 The sons of He´bron were Je·ri´ah the head, Am·a·ri´ah the second, Ja·ha·zi´el the third and Jek·a·me´am the fourth.
</br>20 The sons of Uz´zi·el were Mi´cah the head and Is·shi´ah the second.
<p></p>
</br>21 The sons of Me·rar´i were Mah´li and Mu´shi. The sons of Mah´li were El·e·a´zar and Kish.
</br>22 But El·e·a´zar died; and he had come to have, not sons, but daughters. So the sons of Kish their brothers took them [as wives].
</br>23 The sons of Mu´shi were Mah´li and E´der and Jer´e·moth, three.
<p></p>
</br>24 These were the sons of Le´vi by the house of their fathers, the heads of the fathers, by their commissioned ones, in the number of the names, head by head of them, the doers of the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from the age of twenty years upward.
</br>25 For David had said: “Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people, and he will reside in Jerusalem to time indefinite.
</br>26 And also the Levites will not have to carry the tabernacle or any of its utensils for its service.”
</br>27 For by the last words of David these were the number of the sons of Le´vi from the age of twenty years upward.
</br>28 For their function was at the disposition of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah over the courtyards and over the dining rooms and over the purification of every holy thing and the work of the service of the house of the [true] God,
</br>29 even for the layer bread and for the fine flour for the grain offering and for the wafers of unfermented bread and for the griddle [cakes] and for the mixed dough and for all measures of quantity and size;
</br>30 and for standing morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at evening;
</br>31 and for every offering up of the burnt sacrifices to Jehovah at the sabbaths, at the new moons and at the festival seasons, by number according to the rule concerning them, constantly before Jehovah.
</br>32 And they took care of the guarding of the tent of meeting and the guarding of the holy place and the guarding of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of the house of Jehovah.

</br>1 Now the sons of Aaron had their divisions. The sons of Aaron were Na´dab and A·bi´hu, El·e·a´zar and Ith´a·mar.
</br>2 However, Na´dab and A·bi´hu died before their father, and they did not happen to have any sons, but El·e·a´zar and Ith´a·mar continued to act as priests.
</br>3 And David, and Za´dok from the sons of El·e·a´zar, and A·him´e·lech from the sons of Ith´a·mar proceeded to make divisions of them for their office in their service.
</br>4 But the sons of El·e·a´zar were found to be more numerous in headmen than the sons of Ith´a·mar. So they distributed them to the sons of El·e·a´zar, as heads for [their] paternal houses, sixteen, and to the sons of Ith´a·mar, [as heads] for their paternal houses, eight.
<p></p>
</br>5 Further, they distributed them by lots, these along with those, for there had to be chiefs of the holy place and chiefs of the [true] God from the sons of El·e·a´zar and from the sons of Ith´a·mar.
</br>6 Then She·mai´ah the son of Ne·than´el the secretary of the Levites wrote them down before the king and the princes and Za´dok the priest and A·him´e·lech the son of A·bi´a·thar and the heads of the fathers of the priests and of the Levites, one paternal house being picked out for El·e·a´zar and one being picked out for Ith´a·mar.

<p></p>
</br>19 These were their offices for their service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to their due right by the hand of Aaron their forefather, just as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.
<p></p>
</br>20 And of the sons of Le´vi that were left over, of the sons of Am´ram there was Shu´ba·el; of the sons of Shu´ba·el, Jeh·de´iah;
</br>21 of Re·ha·bi´ah: of the sons of Re·ha·bi´ah, Is·shi´ah the head;
</br>22 of the Iz´har·ites, She·lo´moth; of the sons of She·lo´moth, Ja´hath;

</br>24 The sons of Uz´zi·el, Mi´cah; of the sons of Mi´cah, Sha´mir.
</br>25 The brother of Mi´cah was Is·shi´ah; of the sons of Is·shi´ah, Zech·a·ri´ah.

</br>5 All these were sons of He´man, a visionary of the king in the things of the [true] God to raise up his horn; thus the [true] God proceeded to give He´man fourteen sons and three daughters.
</br>6 All these were under the control of their father in song at the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, stringed instruments and harps for the service of the house of the [true] God.

</br>22 of Dan, Az´ar·el the son of Je·ro´ham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>23 And David did not take the number of those from twenty years of age and under, because Jehovah had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of the heavens.
</br>24 Jo´ab the son of Ze·ru´iah had himself started to take the count, but he did not finish; and for this there came to be indignation against Israel, and the number did not come up into the account of the affairs of the days of King David.
<p></p>
</br>25 And over the treasures of the king there was Az´ma·veth the son of Ad´i·el. And over the treasures in the field, in the cities and in the villages and in the towers there was Jon´a·than the son of Uz·zi´ah.
</br>26 And over the doers of work in the field, for the cultivation of the soil, there was Ez´ri the son of Che´lub.
</br>27 And over the vineyards there was Shim´e·i the Ra´math·ite; and over that which was in the vineyards for the wine supplies there was Zab´di the Shiph´mite.
</br>28 And over the olive groves and the sycamore trees that were in the She·phe´lah there was Ba´al-ha´nan the Ge·de´rite; and over the oil supplies there was Jo´ash.
</br>29 And over the herds that were grazing in Shar´on there was Shit´rai the Shar´on·ite; and over the herds in the low plains there was Sha´phat the son of Ad´lai.
</br>30 And over the camels there was O´bil the Ish´ma·el·ite; and over the she-asses there was Jeh·de´iah the Me·ron´o·thite.
</br>31 And over the flocks there was Ja´ziz the Hag´rite. All these were the chiefs of the goods that belonged to King David.
<p></p>
</br>32 And Jon´a·than, David’s nephew, was a counselor, a man of understanding, he being also a secretary; and Je·hi´el the son of Hach´mo·ni was with the king’s sons.
</br>33 And A·hith´o·phel was a counselor of the king; and Hu´shai the Ar´chite was the king’s companion.
</br>34 And after A·hith´o·phel there were Je·hoi´a·da the son of Be·nai´ah and A·bi´a·thar; and Jo´ab was chief of the army of the king.

</br>1 And David proceeded to congregate all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes and the princes of the divisions of those ministering to the king and the chiefs of thousands and the chiefs of hundreds and the chiefs of all the goods and livestock of the king and of his sons, together with the court officials and the mighty men, even every valiant, mighty man, to Jerusalem.
</br>2 Then David the king rose to his feet and said:
<p></p>
“Hear me, my brothers and my people. As for me, it was close to my heart to build a resting house for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and as the footstool of our God, and I had made preparation to build.
</br>3 And the [true] God himself said to me, ‘You will not build a house to my name; for a man of wars you are, and blood you have spilled.’
</br>4 Accordingly Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to become king over Israel to time indefinite; for it was Judah that he chose as leader, and in the house of Judah my father’s house, and among my father’s sons, I was the one whom he approved, to make me king over all Israel;
</br>5 and out of all my sons (for many are the sons whom Jehovah has given me) he then chose Sol´o·mon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingship of Jehovah over Israel.
<p></p>
</br>6 “Further, he said to me, ‘Sol´o·mon your son is the one that will build my house and my courtyards; for I have chosen him as my son, and I myself shall become his father.
</br>7 And I shall certainly establish his kingship firmly to time indefinite if he will be strongly resolved to do my commandments and my judicial decisions, as at this day.’
</br>8 And now, before the eyes of all Israel, Jehovah’s congregation, and in the ears of our God, take care and search for all the commandments of Jehovah YOUR God, in order that YOU may possess the good land and may certainly pass it on as an inheritance to YOUR sons after YOU to time indefinite.
<p></p>
</br>9 “And you, Sol´o·mon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul; for all hearts Jehovah is searching, and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning. If you search for him, he will let himself be found by you; but if you leave him, he will cast you off forever.
</br>10 See, now, for Jehovah himself has chosen you to build a house as a sanctuary. Be courageous and act.”
<p></p>
</br>11 And David proceeded to give Sol´o·mon his son the architectural plan of the porch and of its houses and its storerooms and its roof chambers and its dark inner rooms and the house of the propitiatory cover;
</br>12 even the architectural plan of everything that had come to be with him by inspiration for the courtyards of Jehovah’s house and for all the dining rooms all around, for the treasures of the house of the [true] God and for the treasures of the things made holy;
</br>13 and for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites and for all the work of the service of Jehovah’s house and for all the utensils of the service of Jehovah’s house;
</br>14 for the gold by weight, the gold for all the utensils for the different services, for all the utensils of silver by weight, for all the utensils for the different services;
</br>15 and the weight for the lampstands of gold and their lamps of gold, by weight of the different lampstands and their lamps, and for the lampstands of silver by weight for the lampstand and its lamps according to the service of the different lampstands;
</br>16 and the gold by weight for the tables of the layer bread, for the different tables, and silver for the tables of silver;
</br>17 and the forks and the bowls and the pitchers of pure gold, and for the small gold bowls by weight for the different small bowls, and for the small silver bowls by weight for the different small bowls;
</br>18 and for the incense altar refined gold by weight and for the representation of the chariot, namely, the cherubs of gold for spreading [their wings] out and screening over the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
</br>19 “He gave insight for the entire thing in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, even for all the works of the architectural plan.”
<p></p>
</br>20 And David went on to say to Sol´o·mon his son: “Be courageous and strong and act. Do not be afraid nor be terrified, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you. He will not desert you or leave you until all the work of the service of Jehovah’s house is finished.
</br>21 And here are the divisions of the priests and of the Levites for all the service of the house of the [true] God; and with you in all the work there is every willing one with skill for all the service, and also the princes and all the people, for all your words.”

<p></p>
</br>1 David the king now said to all the congregation: “Sol´o·mon my son, the one [whom] God has chosen, is young and delicate, but the work is great; for the castle is not for man, but for Jehovah God.
</br>2 And according to all my power I have prepared for the house of my God the gold for the goldwork, and the silver for the silverwork, and the copper for the copperwork, the iron for the ironwork, and the timbers for the timberwork; onyx stones, and stones to be set with hard mortar, and mosaic pebbles, and every precious stone, and alabaster stones in great quantity.
</br>3 And since I am taking pleasure in the house of my God, there is yet a special property of mine, gold and silver; I do give it to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house:
</br>4 three thousand talents of gold of the gold of O´phir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for coating the walls of the houses;
</br>5 of the gold for the goldwork, and of the silver for the silverwork and for all the work by the hand of the craftsmen. And who is there volunteering to fill his hand today [with a gift] for Jehovah?”
<p></p>
</br>6 And the princes of the paternal houses and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds and the chiefs of the business of the king proceeded to volunteer.
</br>7 Accordingly they gave to the service of the house of the [true] God gold worth five thousand talents and ten thousand darics and silver worth ten thousand talents and copper worth eighteen thousand talents and iron worth a hundred thousand talents.
</br>8 And what stones were found with any persons they gave to the treasure of the house of Jehovah under the control of Je·hi´el the Ger´shon·ite.
</br>9 And the people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah; and even David the king himself rejoiced with great joy.
<p></p>
</br>10 Consequently David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation and David said: “Blessed may you be, O Jehovah the God of Israel our father, from time indefinite even to time indefinite.
</br>11 Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the excellency and the dignity; for everything in the heavens and in the earth is [yours]. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the One also lifting yourself up as head over all.
</br>12 The riches and the glory are on account of you, and you are dominating everything; and in your hand there are power and mightiness, and in your hand is [ability] to make great and to give strength to all.
</br>13 And now, O our God, we are thanking you and praising your beauteous name.
<p></p>
</br>14 “And yet, who am I and who are my people, that we should retain power to make voluntary offerings like this? For everything is from you, and out of your own hand we have given to you.
</br>15 For we are alien residents before you and settlers the same as all our forefathers. Like a shadow our days are upon the earth and there is no hope.
</br>16 O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name, from your hand it is, and to you it all belongs.
</br>17 And I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things, and now your people who are on hand here I have enjoyed seeing make offerings voluntarily to you.
</br>18 O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel our forefathers, do keep this to time indefinite as the inclination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their heart to you.
</br>19 And to Sol´o·mon my son give a complete heart to keep your commandments, your testimonies and your regulations, and to do everything, and to build the castle for which I have made preparation.”
<p></p>
</br>20 And David went on to say to all the congregation: “Bless, now, Jehovah YOUR God.” And all the congregation proceeded to bless Jehovah the God of their forefathers and bow low and prostrate themselves to Jehovah and to the king.
</br>21 And they continued to sacrifice sacrifices to Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the day following that day, a thousand young bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand male lambs and their drink offerings, even sacrifices in great number for all Israel.
</br>22 And they continued eating and drinking before Jehovah on that day with great rejoicing; and they proceeded a second time to make Sol´o·mon the son of David king and to anoint him to Jehovah as leader and also Za´dok as priest.
</br>23 And Sol´o·mon began to sit upon Jehovah’s throne as king in place of David his father and to make a success of it, and all the Israelites were obedient to him.
</br>24 As for all the princes and the mighty men and also all the sons of King David, they submitted themselves to Sol´o·mon the king.
</br>25 And Jehovah continued to make Sol´o·mon surpassingly great before the eyes of all Israel and to put upon him such royal dignity as had not come to be upon any king before him over Israel.
<p></p>
</br>26 As for David the son of Jes´se, he reigned over all Israel;
</br>27 and the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years. In He´bron he reigned for seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three [years].
</br>28 And gradually he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and glory; and Sol´o·mon his son began to reign in place of him.
</br>29 As for the affairs of David the king, the first ones and the last, there they are written among the words of Samuel the seer and among the words of Nathan the prophet and among the words of Gad the visionary,
</br>30 together with all his kingship and his mightiness and the times that had passed over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the lands.
