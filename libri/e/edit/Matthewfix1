</br>18 But the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way. During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united.
</br>19 However, Joseph her husband, because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, intended to divorce her secretly.
</br>20 But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home, for that which has been begotten in her is by holy spirit.
</br>21 She will give birth to a son, and you must call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
</br>22 All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying:
</br>23 “Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Im·man´u·el,” which means, when translated, “With Us Is God.”
<p></p>
</br>24 Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him, and he took his wife home.

</br>1 After Jesus had been born in Beth´le·hem of Ju·de´a in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from eastern parts came to Jerusalem,
</br>2 saying: “Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star [when we were] in the east, and we have come to do him obeisance.”
</br>3 At hearing this King Herod was agitated, and all Jerusalem along with him;
</br>4 and on gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.
</br>5 They said to him: “In Beth´le·hem of Ju·de´a; for this is how it has been written through the prophet,
</br>6 ‘And you, O Beth´le·hem of the land of Judah, are by no means the most insignificant [city] among the governors of Judah; for out of you will come forth a governing one, who will shepherd my people, Israel.’”
<p></p>
</br>7 Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearing;
</br>8 and, when sending them to Beth´le·hem, he said: “Go make a careful search for the young child, and when YOU have found it report back to me, that I too may go and do it obeisance.”
</br>9 When they had heard the king, they went their way; and, look! the star they had seen [when they were] in the east went ahead of them, until it came to a stop above where the young child was.
</br>10 On seeing the star they rejoiced very much indeed.
</br>11 And when they went into the house they saw the young child with Mary its mother, and, falling down, they did obeisance to it. They also opened their treasures and presented it with gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
</br>12 However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another way.
<p></p>
</br>13 After they had withdrawn, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I give you word; for Herod is about to search for the young child to destroy it.”
</br>14 So he got up and took along the young child and its mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,
</br>15 and he stayed there until the decease of Herod, for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
<p></p>
</br>16 Then Herod, seeing he had been outwitted by the astrologers, fell into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Beth´le·hem and in all its districts done away with, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers.
</br>17 Then that was fulfilled which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
</br>18 “A voice was heard in Ra´mah, weeping and much wailing; it was Rachel weeping for her children, and she was unwilling to take comfort, because they are no more.”
<p></p>
</br>19 When Herod had deceased, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
</br>20 and said: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and be on your way into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the soul of the young child are dead.”
</br>21 So he got up and took the young child and its mother and entered into the land of Israel.
</br>22 But hearing that Ar·che·la´us ruled as king of Ju·de´a instead of his father Herod, he became afraid to depart for there. Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew into the territory of Gal´i·lee,
</br>23 and came and dwelt in a city named Naz´a·reth, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Naz·a·rene´.”

</br>1 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Ju·de´a,
</br>2 saying: “REPENT, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
</br>3 This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, YOU people! Make his roads straight.’”
</br>4 But this very John had his clothing of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins; his food too was insect locusts and wild honey.
</br>5 Then Jerusalem and all Ju·de´a and all the country around the Jordan made their way out to him,
</br>6 and people were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.
<p></p>
</br>7 When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: “YOU offspring of vipers, who has intimated to YOU to flee from the coming wrath?
</br>8 So then produce fruit that befits repentance;
</br>9 and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to YOU that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
</br>10 Already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.
</br>11 I, for my part, baptize YOU with water because of YOUR repentance; but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not fit to take off. That one will baptize YOU people with holy spirit and with fire.
</br>12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will completely clean up his threshing floor, and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”
<p></p>
</br>13 Then Jesus came from Gal´i·lee to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized by him.
</br>14 But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”
</br>15 In reply Jesus said to him: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him.
</br>16 After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him.
</br>17 Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”

</br>1 Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.
</br>2 After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.
</br>3 Also, the Tempter came and said to him: “If you are a son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”
</br>4 But in reply he said: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’”
<p></p>
</br>5 Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him upon the battlement of the temple
</br>6 and said to him: “If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will give his angels a charge concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone.’”
</br>7 Jesus said to him: “Again it is written, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’”
<p></p>
</br>8 Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
</br>9 and he said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.”
</br>10 Then Jesus said to him: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”
</br>11 Then the Devil left him, and, look! angels came and began to minister to him.
<p></p>
</br>12 Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Gal´i·lee.
</br>13 Further, after leaving Naz´a·reth, he came and took up residence in Ca·per´na·um beside the sea in the districts of Zeb´u·lun and Naph´ta·li,
</br>14 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:
</br>15 “O land of Zeb´u·lun and land of Naph´ta·li, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Gal´i·lee of the nations!
</br>16 the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.”
</br>17 From that time on Jesus commenced preaching and saying: “Repent, YOU people, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”
<p></p>
</br>18 Walking alongside the sea of Gal´i·lee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, letting down a fishing net into the sea, for they were fishers.
</br>19 And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make YOU fishers of men.”
</br>20 At once abandoning the nets, they followed him.
</br>21 Going on also from there he saw two others [who were] brothers, James [the son] of Zeb´e·dee and John his brother, in the boat with Zeb´e·dee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.
</br>22 At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.
<p></p>
</br>23 Then he went around throughout the whole of Gal´i·lee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.
</br>24 And the report about him went out into all Syria; and they brought him all those faring badly, distressed with various diseases and torments, demon-possessed and epileptic and paralyzed persons, and he cured them.
</br>25 Consequently great crowds followed him from Gal´i·lee and De·cap´o·lis and Jerusalem and Ju·de´a and from the other side of the Jordan.

</br>1 When he saw the crowds he went up into the mountain; and after he sat down his disciples came to him;
</br>2 and he opened his mouth and began teaching them, saying:
<p></p>
</br>3 “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
<p></p>
</br>4 “Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.
<p></p>
</br>5 “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.
<p></p>
</br>6 “Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.
<p></p>
</br>7 “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.
<p></p>
</br>8 “Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.
<p></p>
</br>9 “Happy are the peaceable, since they will be called ‘sons of God.’
<p></p>
</br>10 “Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.
<p></p>
</br>11 “Happy are YOU when people reproach YOU and persecute YOU and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against YOU for my sake.
</br>12 Rejoice and leap for joy, since YOUR reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to YOU.
<p></p>
</br>13 “YOU are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.
<p></p>
</br>14 “YOU are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain.
</br>15 People light a lamp and set it, not under the measuring basket, but upon the lampstand, and it shines upon all those in the house.
</br>16 Likewise let YOUR light shine before men, that they may see YOUR fine works and give glory to YOUR Father who is in the heavens.
<p></p>
</br>17 “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill;
</br>18 for truly I say to YOU that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.
</br>19 Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches mankind to that effect, he will be called ‘least’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. As for anyone who does them and teaches them, this one will be called ‘great’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens.
</br>20 For I say to YOU that if YOUR righteousness does not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, YOU will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
<p></p>
</br>21 “YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder; but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’
</br>22 However, I say to YOU that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·hen´na.
<p></p>
</br>23 “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you,
</br>24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.
<p></p>
</br>25 “Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law, while you are with him on the way there, that somehow the complainant may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.
</br>26 I say to you for a fact, You will certainly not come out from there until you have paid over the last coin of very little value.
<p></p>
</br>27 “YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’
</br>28 But I say to YOU that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
</br>29 If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost to you than for your whole body to be pitched into Ge·hen´na.
</br>30 Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Ge·hen´na.
<p></p>
</br>31 “Moreover it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’
</br>32 However, I say to YOU that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
<p></p>
</br>33 “Again YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’
</br>34 However, I say to YOU: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God’s throne;
</br>35 nor by earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
</br>36 Nor by your head must you swear, because you cannot turn one hair white or black.
</br>37 Just let YOUR word Yes mean Yes, YOUR No, No; for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one.
<p></p>
</br>38 “YOU heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’
</br>39 However, I say to YOU: Do not resist him that is wicked; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.
</br>40 And if a person wants to go to court with you and get possession of your inner garment, let your outer garment also go to him;
</br>41 and if someone under authority impresses you into service for a mile, go with him two miles.
</br>42 Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one that wants to borrow from you [without interest].
<p></p>
</br>43 “YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
</br>44 However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU;
</br>45 that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.
</br>46 For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing?

</br>27 Who of YOU by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?
</br>28 Also, on the matter of clothing, why are YOU anxious? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they are growing; they do not toil, nor do they spin;
</br>29 but I say to YOU that not even Sol´o·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
</br>30 If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe YOU, YOU with little faith?

</br>29 for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.

</br>1 After he had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him.
</br>2 And, look! a leprous man came up and began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”
</br>3 And so, stretching out [his] hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to. Be made clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.
</br>4 Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for the purpose of a witness to them.”
<p></p>
</br>5 When he entered into Ca·per´na·um, an army officer came to him, entreating him
</br>6 and saying: “Sir, my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis, being terribly tormented.”
</br>7 He said to him: “When I get there I will cure him.”
</br>8 In reply the army officer said: “Sir, I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof, but just say the word and my manservant will be healed.
</br>9 For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Be on your way!’ and he is on his way, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
</br>10 Hearing that, Jesus became amazed and said to those following him: “I tell YOU the truth, With no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.
</br>11 But I tell YOU that many from eastern parts and western parts will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;
</br>12 whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.”
</br>13 Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as it has been your faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the manservant was healed in that hour.
<p></p>
</br>14 And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.
</br>15 So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.
</br>16 But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed persons; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were faring badly;
</br>17 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”
<p></p>
</br>18 When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to shove off for the other side.
</br>19 And a certain scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you are about to go.”
</br>20 But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”
</br>21 Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to leave and bury my father.”
</br>22 Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”
<p></p>
</br>23 And when he got aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.
</br>24 Now, look! a great agitation arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; he, however, was sleeping.
</br>25 And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”
</br>26 But he said to them: “Why are YOU fainthearted, YOU with little faith?” Then, getting up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.
</br>27 So the men became amazed and said: “What sort of person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”
<p></p>
</br>28 When he got to the other side, into the country of the Gad·a·renes´, there met him two demon-possessed men coming out from among the memorial tombs, unusually fierce, so that nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.
</br>29 And, look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”
</br>30 But a long way off from them a herd of many swine was at pasture.
</br>31 So the demons began to entreat him, saying: “If you expel us, send us forth into the herd of swine.”
</br>32 Accordingly he said to them: “Go!” They came out and went off into the swine; and, look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.
</br>33 But the herders fled and, going into the city, they reported everything, including the affair of the demon-possessed men.
</br>34 And, look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus; and after having seen him, they earnestly urged him to move out from their districts.

<p></p>
</br>1 So, boarding the boat, he proceeded across and went into his own city.
</br>2 And, look! they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. On seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic: “Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.”
</br>3 And, look! certain of the scribes said to themselves: “This fellow is blaspheming.”
</br>4 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “Why are YOU thinking wicked things in YOUR hearts?
</br>5 For instance, which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up and walk?
</br>6 However, in order for YOU to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” then he said to the paralytic: “Get up, pick up your bed, and go to your home.”
</br>7 And he got up and went off to his home.
</br>8 At the sight of this the crowds were struck with fear, and they glorified God, who gave such authority to men.
<p></p>
</br>9 Next, while passing along from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew seated at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” Thereupon he did rise up and follow him.
</br>10 Later, while he was reclining at the table in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
</br>11 But on seeing this the Pharisees began to say to his disciples: “Why is it that YOUR teacher eats with tax collectors and sinners?”
</br>12 Hearing [them], he said: “Persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.
</br>13 Go, then, and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then John’s disciples came to him and asked: “Why is it that we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast?”
</br>15 At this Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, do they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
</br>16 Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old outer garment; for its full strength would pull from the outer garment and the tear would become worse.
</br>17 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.”
<p></p>
</br>18 While he was telling them these things, look! a certain ruler who had approached began to do obeisance to him, saying: “By now my daughter must be dead; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will come to life.”
<p></p>
</br>19 Then Jesus, getting up, began to follow him; also his disciples did.
</br>20 And, look! a woman suffering twelve years from a flow of blood came up behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment;
</br>21 for she kept saying to herself: “If I only touch his outer garment I shall get well.”
</br>22 Jesus turned around and, noticing her, said: “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And from that hour the woman became well.
<p></p>
</br>23 When, now, he came into the ruler’s house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd in noisy confusion,
</br>24 Jesus began to say: “Leave the place, for the little girl did not die, but she is sleeping.” At this they began to laugh at him scornfully.
</br>25 As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, and the little girl got up.
</br>26 Of course, the talk about this spread out into all that region.
<p></p>
</br>27 As Jesus was passing along from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”
</br>28 After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: “Do YOU have faith that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord.”
</br>29 Then he touched their eyes, saying: “According to YOUR faith let it happen to YOU.”
</br>30 And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly charged them, saying: “See that nobody gets to know it.”
</br>31 But they, after getting outside, made it public about him in all that region.
<p></p>
</br>32 Now when they were leaving, look! people brought him a dumb man possessed of a demon;
</br>33 and after the demon had been expelled the dumb man spoke. Well, the crowds felt amazement and said: “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.”
</br>34 But the Pharisees began to say: “It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.”
<p></p>
</br>35 And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.
</br>36 On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.
</br>37 Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.
</br>38 Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”

<p></p>
</br>1 So he summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.
<p></p>
</br>2 The names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, the one called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the [son] of Zeb´e·dee and John his brother;
</br>3 Philip and Bar·thol´o·mew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the [son] of Al·phae´us, and Thad·dae´us;
</br>4 Simon the Ca·na·nae´an, and Judas Is·car´i·ot, who later betrayed him.
<p></p>
</br>5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these orders: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Sa·mar´i·tan city;
</br>6 but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
</br>7 As YOU go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’
</br>8 Cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. YOU received free, give free.
</br>9 Do not procure gold or silver or copper for YOUR girdle purses,
</br>10 or a food pouch for the trip, or two undergarments, or sandals or a staff; for the worker deserves his food.
<p></p>
</br>11 “Into whatever city or village YOU enter, search out who in it is deserving, and stay there until YOU leave.
</br>12 When YOU are entering into the house, greet the household;
</br>13 and if the house is deserving, let the peace YOU wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from YOU return upon YOU.
</br>14 Wherever anyone does not take YOU in or listen to YOUR words, on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off YOUR feet.
</br>15 Truly I say to YOU, It will be more endurable for the land of Sod´om and Go·mor´rah on Judgment Day than for that city.
<p></p>
</br>16 “Look! I am sending YOU forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.
</br>17 Be on YOUR guard against men; for they will deliver YOU up to local courts, and they will scourge YOU in their synagogues.
</br>18 Why, YOU will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.
</br>19 However, when they deliver YOU up, do not become anxious about how or what YOU are to speak; for what YOU are to speak will be given YOU in that hour;
</br>20 for the ones speaking are not just YOU, but it is the spirit of YOUR Father that speaks by YOU.
</br>21 Further, brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death.
</br>22 And YOU will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.
</br>23 When they persecute YOU in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to YOU, YOU will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.

</br>24 “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord.
</br>25 It is enough for the disciple to become as his teacher, and the slave as his lord. If people have called the householder Be·el´ze·bub, how much more [will they call] those of his household so?
</br>26 Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known.
</br>27 What I tell YOU in the darkness, say in the light; and what YOU hear whispered, preach from the housetops.
</br>28 And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Ge·hen´na.
</br>29 Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without YOUR Father’s [knowledge].
</br>30 But the very hairs of YOUR head are all numbered.
</br>31 Therefore have no fear: YOU are worth more than many sparrows.

</br>32 “Everyone, then, that confesses union with me before men, I will also confess union with him before my Father who is in the heavens;
</br>33 but whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens.
</br>34 Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth; I came to put, not peace, but a sword.
</br>35 For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law.
</br>36 Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.
</br>37 He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me.
</br>38 And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me.
</br>39 He that finds his soul will lose it, and he that loses his soul for my sake will find it.

</br>40 “He that receives YOU receives me also, and he that receives me receives him also that sent me forth.
</br>41 He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet’s reward, and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man’s reward.

</br>1 Now when Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.
<p></p>
</br>2 But John, having heard in jail about the works of the Christ, sent by means of his own disciples
</br>3 and said to him: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?”
</br>4 In reply Jesus said to them: “Go YOUR way and report to John what YOU are hearing and seeing:
</br>5 The blind are seeing again, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, and the dead are being raised up, and the poor are having the good news declared to them;
</br>6 and happy is he that finds no cause for stumbling in me.”
<p></p>
</br>7 While these were on their way, Jesus started to say to the crowds respecting John: “What did YOU go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed being tossed by a wind?
</br>8 What, then, did YOU go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings.
</br>9 Really, then, why did YOU go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell YOU, and far more than a prophet.
</br>10 This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Look! I myself am sending forth my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way ahead of you!’
</br>11 Truly I say to YOU people, Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.
</br>12 But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it.
</br>13 For all, the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John;
</br>14 and if YOU want to accept it, He himself is ‘E·li´jah who is destined to come.’
</br>15 Let him that has ears listen.
<p></p>
</br>16 “With whom shall I compare this generation? It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who cry out to their playmates,
</br>17 saying, ‘We played the flute for YOU, but YOU did not dance; we wailed, but YOU did not beat yourselves in grief.’
</br>18 Correspondingly, John came neither eating nor drinking, yet people say, ‘He has a demon’;
</br>19 the Son of man did come eating and drinking, still people say, ‘Look! A man gluttonous and given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Then he started to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place, because they did not repent:
</br>21 “Woe to you, Cho·ra´zin! Woe to you, Beth·sa´i·da! because if the powerful works had taken place in Tyre and Si´don that took place in YOU, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.
</br>22 Consequently I say to YOU, It will be more endurable for Tyre and Si´don on Judgment Day than for YOU.
</br>23 And you, Ca·per´na·um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to Ha´des you will come; because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sod´om, it would have remained until this very day.
</br>24 Consequently I say to YOU people, It will be more endurable for the land of Sod´om on Judgment Day than for you.”
<p></p>
</br>25 At that time Jesus said in response: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to babes.
</br>26 Yes, O Father, because to do thus came to be the way approved by you.
</br>27 All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.
</br>28 Come to me, all YOU who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh YOU.
</br>29 Take my yoke upon YOU and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and YOU will find refreshment for YOUR souls.

</br>1 At that season Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
</br>2 At seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.”
</br>3 He said to them: “Have YOU not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry?
</br>4 How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?
</br>5 Or, have YOU not read in the Law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple treat the sabbath as not sacred and continue guiltless?
</br>6 But I tell YOU that something greater than the temple is here.
</br>7 However, if YOU had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice,’ YOU would not have condemned the guiltless ones.
</br>8 For Lord of the sabbath is what the Son of man is.”
<p></p>
</br>9 After departing from that place he went into their synagogue;
</br>10 and, look! a man with a withered hand! So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath?” that they might get an accusation against him.
</br>11 He said to them: “Who will be the man among YOU that has one sheep and, if this falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not get hold of it and lift it out?
</br>12 All considered, of how much more worth is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the sabbath.”
</br>13 Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand.
</br>14 But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him that they might destroy him.
</br>15 Having come to know [this], Jesus withdrew from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all,
</br>16 but he strictly charged them not to make him manifest;
</br>17 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:
<p></p>
</br>18 “Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom my soul approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations.
</br>19 He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.
</br>20 No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering flaxen wick will he extinguish, until he sends out justice with success.
</br>21 Indeed, in his name nations will hope.”
<p></p>
</br>22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
</br>23 Well, all the crowds were simply carried away and began to say: “May this not perhaps be the Son of David?”
</br>24 At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Be·el´ze·bub, the ruler of the demons.”
</br>25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
</br>26 In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand?
</br>27 Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Be·el´ze·bub, by means of whom do YOUR sons expel them? This is why they will be judges of YOU.
</br>28 But if it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken YOU.
</br>29 Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his movable goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
</br>30 He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.
<p></p>
</br>31 “On this account I say to YOU, Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.
</br>32 For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.

</br>33 “Either YOU people make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.
</br>34 Offspring of vipers, how can YOU speak good things, when YOU are wicked? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
</br>35 The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things.
</br>36 I tell YOU that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day;
</br>37 for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.”
<p></p>
</br>38 Then as an answer to him some of the scribes and Pharisees said: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
</br>39 In reply he said to them: “A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jo´nah the prophet.
</br>40 For just as Jo´nah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
</br>41 Men of Nin´e·veh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repented at what Jo´nah preached, but, look! something more than Jo´nah is here.
</br>42 The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Sol´o·mon, but, look! something more than Sol´o·mon is here.

</br>43 “When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through parched places in search of a resting-place, and finds none.
</br>44 Then it says, ‘I will go back to my house out of which I moved’; and on arriving it finds it unoccupied but swept clean and adorned.
</br>45 Then it goes its way and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and, after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.”
<p></p>
</br>46 While he was yet speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and brothers took up a position outside seeking to speak to him.
</br>47 So someone said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.”
</br>48 As an answer he said to the one telling him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
</br>49 And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: “Look! My mother and my brothers!

</br>1 On that day Jesus, having left the house, was sitting by the sea;
</br>2 and great crowds gathered to him, so that he went aboard a boat and sat down, and all the crowd was standing on the beach.
</br>3 Then he told them many things by illustrations, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow;
</br>4 and as he was sowing, some [seeds] fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.
</br>5 Others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil, and at once they sprang up because of not having depth of soil.
</br>6 But when the sun rose they were scorched, and because of not having root they withered.
</br>7 Others, too, fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
</br>8 Still others fell upon the fine soil and they began to yield fruit, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.
</br>9 Let him that has ears listen.”
<p></p>
</br>10 So the disciples came up and said to him: “Why is it you speak to them by the use of illustrations?”
</br>11 In reply he said: “To YOU it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those people it is not granted.
</br>12 For whoever has, more will be given him and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
</br>13 This is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations, because, looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, neither do they get the sense of it;
</br>14 and toward them the prophecy of Isaiah is having fulfillment, which says, ‘By hearing, YOU will hear but by no means get the sense of it; and, looking, YOU will look but by no means see.
</br>15 For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes; that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back, and I heal them.’
<p></p>
</br>16 “However, happy are YOUR eyes because they behold, and YOUR ears because they hear.
</br>17 For I truly say to YOU, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things YOU are beholding and did not see them, and to hear the things YOU are hearing and did not hear them.
<p></p>
</br>18 “YOU, then, listen to the illustration of the man that sowed.
</br>19 Where anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road.
</br>20 As for the one sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy.
</br>21 Yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled.
</br>22 As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
</br>23 As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.”

</br>24 Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man that sowed fine seed in his field.
</br>25 While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat, and left.
</br>26 When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds appeared also.
</br>27 So the slaves of the householder came up and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it come to have weeds?’
</br>28 He said to them, ‘An enemy, a man, did this.’ They said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?’
</br>29 He said, ‘No; that by no chance, while collecting the weeds, YOU uproot the wheat with them.
</br>30 Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up, then go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.’”
<p></p>
</br>31 Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain, which a man took and planted in his field;
</br>32 which is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the largest of the vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches.”
<p></p>
</br>33 Another illustration he spoke to them: “The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three large measures of flour, until the whole mass was fermented.”
<p></p>
</br>34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them;
</br>35 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet who said: “I will open my mouth with illustrations, I will publish things hidden since the founding.”
<p></p>
</br>36 Then after dismissing the crowds he went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: “Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.”
</br>37 In response he said: “The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man;
</br>38 the field is the world; as for the fine seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one,
</br>39 and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things, and the reapers are angels.
</br>40 Therefore, just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things.
</br>41 The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and persons who are doing lawlessness,
</br>42 and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.
</br>43 At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him that has ears listen.
<p></p>
</br>44 “The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid; and for the joy he has he goes and sells what things he has and buys that field.
<p></p>
</br>45 “Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls.
</br>46 Upon finding one pearl of high value, away he went and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.
<p></p>
</br>47 “Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering up [fish] of every kind.
</br>48 When it got full they hauled it up onto the beach and, sitting down, they collected the fine ones into vessels, but the unsuitable they threw away.
</br>49 That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things: the angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous
</br>50 and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.
<p></p>
</br>51 “Did YOU get the sense of all these things?” They said to him: “Yes.”
</br>52 Then he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.”
<p></p>
</br>53 Now when Jesus had finished these illustrations he went across country from there.
</br>54 And after coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: “Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works?
</br>55 Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
</br>56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man get all these things?”
</br>57 So they began to stumble at him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not unhonored except in his home territory and in his own house.”
</br>58 And he did not do many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.

</br>1 At that particular time Herod, the district ruler, heard the report about Jesus
</br>2 and said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why the powerful works are operating in him.”
</br>3 For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him away in prison on account of He·ro´di·as the wife of Philip his brother.
</br>4 For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to be having her.”
</br>5 However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet.
</br>6 But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the daughter of He·ro´di·as danced at it and pleased Herod so much
</br>7 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
</br>8 Then she, under her mother’s coaching, said: “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
</br>9 Grieved though he was, the king out of regard for his oaths and for those reclining with him commanded it to be given;
</br>10 and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
</br>11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.
</br>12 Finally his disciples came up and removed the corpse and buried him and came and reported to Jesus.
</br>13 At hearing this Jesus withdrew from there by boat into a lonely place for isolation; but the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.
<p></p>
</br>14 Now when he came forth he saw a great crowd; and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones.
</br>15 But when evening fell his disciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely and the hour is already far advanced; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves things to eat.”
</br>16 However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave: YOU give them something to eat.”
</br>17 They said to him: “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes.”
</br>18 He said: “BRING them here to me.”
</br>19 Next he commanded the crowds to recline on the grass and took the five loaves and two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he said a blessing and, after breaking the loaves, he distributed them to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.
</br>20 So all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the surplus of fragments, twelve baskets full.
</br>21 Yet those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and young children.
</br>22 Then, without delay, he compelled his disciples to board the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
<p></p>
</br>23 Eventually, having sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. Though it became late, he was there alone.
</br>24 By now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land, being hard put to it by the waves, because the wind was against them.
</br>25 But in the fourth watch period of the night he came to them, walking over the sea.
</br>26 When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear.
</br>27 But at once Jesus spoke to them with the words: “Take courage, it is I; have no fear.”
</br>28 In reply Peter said to him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.”
</br>29 He said: “Come!” Thereupon Peter, getting down off the boat, walked over the waters and went toward Jesus.
</br>30 But looking at the windstorm, he got afraid and, after starting to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”
</br>31 Immediately stretching out his hand Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?”
</br>32 And after they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated.
</br>33 Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: “You are really God’s Son.”
</br>34 And they got across and came to land in Gen·nes´a·ret.
<p></p>
</br>35 Upon recognizing him the men of that place sent forth into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill.
</br>36 And they went entreating him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment; and all those who touched it were made completely well.

</br>1 Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying:
</br>2 “Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal.”
<p></p>
</br>3 In reply he said to them: “Why is it YOU also overstep the commandment of God because of YOUR tradition?
</br>4 For example, God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Let him that reviles father or mother end up in death.’
</br>5 But YOU say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother: “Whatever I have by which you might get benefit from me is a gift dedicated to God,”
</br>6 he must not honor his father at all.’ And so YOU have made the word of God invalid because of YOUR tradition.
</br>7 YOU hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about YOU, when he said,
</br>8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.
</br>9 It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”
</br>10 With that he called the crowd near and said to them: “Listen and get the sense of it:
</br>11 Not what enters into [his] mouth defiles a man; but it is what proceeds out of [his] mouth that defiles a man.”
<p></p>
</br>12 Then the disciples came up and said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees stumbled at hearing what you said?”
</br>13 In reply he said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.
</br>14 LET them be. Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”
</br>15 By way of response Peter said to him: “Make the illustration plain to us.”
</br>16 At this he said: “Are YOU also yet without understanding?
</br>17 Are YOU not aware that everything entering into the mouth passes along into the intestines and is discharged into the sewer?
</br>18 However, the things proceeding out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those things defile a man.
</br>19 For example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thieveries, false testimonies, blasphemies.
</br>20 These are the things defiling a man; but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”
<p></p>
</br>21 Leaving there, Jesus now withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Si´don.
</br>22 And, look! a Phoe·ni´cian woman from those regions came out and cried aloud, saying: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is badly demonized.”
</br>23 But he did not say a word in answer to her. So his disciples came up and began to request him: “Send her away; because she keeps crying out after us.”
</br>24 In answer he said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
</br>25 When the woman came she began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, help me!”
</br>26 In answer he said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.”
</br>27 She said: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”
</br>28 Then Jesus said in reply to her: “O woman, great is your faith; let it happen to you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed from that hour on.
<p></p>
</br>29 Crossing country from there, Jesus next came near the sea of Gal´i·lee, and, after going up into the mountain, he was sitting there.
</br>30 Then great crowds approached him, having along with them people that were lame, maimed, blind, dumb, and many otherwise, and they fairly threw them at his feet, and he cured them;
</br>31 so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb speaking and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>32 But Jesus called his disciples to him and said: “I feel pity for the crowd, because it is already three days that they have stayed with me and they have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away fasting. They may possibly give out on the road.”
</br>33 However, the disciples said to him: “Where are we in this lonely place going to get sufficient loaves to satisfy a crowd of this size?”
</br>34 At this Jesus said to them: “How many loaves have YOU?” They said: “Seven, and a few little fishes.”
</br>35 So, after instructing the crowd to recline upon the ground,
</br>36 he took the seven loaves and the fishes and, after offering thanks, he broke them and began distributing to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.
</br>37 And all ate and were satisfied, and as a surplus of fragments they took up seven provision baskets full.
</br>38 Yet those eating were four thousand men, besides women and young children.
</br>39 Finally, after sending the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the regions of Mag´a·dan.

</br>1 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him and, to tempt him, they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven.
</br>2 In reply he said to them: “[[When evening falls YOU are accustomed to say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red’;
</br>3 and at morning, ‘It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red, but gloomy-looking.’ YOU know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times YOU cannot interpret.]]
</br>4 A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jo´nah.” With that he went away, leaving them behind.
<p></p>
</br>5 Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take loaves along.
</br>6 Jesus said to them: “Keep YOUR eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
</br>7 So they began to reason among themselves, saying: “We did not take any loaves along.”
</br>8 Knowing this, Jesus said: “Why are YOU doing this reasoning among yourselves, because YOU have no loaves, YOU with little faith?
</br>9 Do YOU not yet see the point, or do YOU not remember the five loaves in the case of the five thousand and how many baskets YOU took up?
</br>10 Or the seven loaves in the case of the four thousand and how many provision baskets YOU took up?
</br>11 How is it YOU do not discern that I did not talk to YOU about loaves? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
</br>12 Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<p></p>
</br>13 Now when he had come into the parts of Caes·a·re´a Phi·lip´pi, Jesus went asking his disciples: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?”
</br>14 They said: “Some say John the Baptist, others E·li´jah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
</br>15 He said to them: “YOU, though, who do YOU say I am?”
</br>16 In answer Simon Peter said: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
</br>17 In response Jesus said to him: “Happy you are, Simon son of Jo´nah, because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to you, but my Father who is in the heavens did.
</br>18 Also, I say to you, You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Ha´des will not overpower it.
</br>19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will be the thing bound in the heavens, and whatever you may loose on earth will be the thing loosed in the heavens.”
</br>20 Then he sternly charged the disciples not to say to anybody that he was the Christ.
<p></p>
</br>21 From that time forward Jesus Christ commenced showing his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.
</br>22 At this Peter took him aside and commenced rebuking him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this [destiny] at all.”
</br>23 But, turning his back, he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”
<p></p>
</br>24 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.
</br>25 For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.
</br>26 For what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
</br>27 For the Son of man is destined to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will recompense each one according to his behavior.

</br>1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother along and brought them up into a lofty mountain by themselves.
</br>2 And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant as the light.
</br>3 And, look! there appeared to them Moses and E·li´jah, conversing with him.
</br>4 Responsively Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, it is fine for us to be here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for E·li´jah.”
</br>5 While he was yet speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and, look! a voice out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him.”
</br>6 At hearing this the disciples fell upon their faces and became very much afraid.
</br>7 Then Jesus came near and, touching them, said: “Get up and have no fear.”
</br>8 When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself only.
</br>9 And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.”
<p></p>
</br>10 However, the disciples put the question to him: “Why, then, do the scribes say that E·li´jah must come first?”
</br>11 In reply he said: “E·li´jah, indeed, is coming and will restore all things.
</br>12 However, I say to YOU that E·li´jah has already come and they did not recognize him but did with him the things they wanted. In this way also the Son of man is destined to suffer at their hands.”
</br>13 Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.
<p></p>
</br>14 And when they came toward the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down to him and saying:
</br>15 “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill, for he falls often into the fire and often into the water;
</br>16 and I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”
</br>17 In reply Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with YOU? How long must I put up with YOU? Bring him here to me.”
</br>18 Then Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out of him; and the boy was cured from that hour.
</br>19 Thereupon the disciples came up to Jesus privately and said: “Why is it we could not expel it?”
</br>20 He said to them: “Because of YOUR little faith. For truly I say to YOU, If YOU have faith the size of a mustard grain, YOU will say to this mountain, ‘Transfer from here to there,’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for YOU.”

</br>22 It was while they were gathered together in Gal´i·lee that Jesus said to them: “The Son of man is destined to be betrayed into men’s hands,

</br>24 After they arrived in Ca·per´na·um the men collecting the two drachmas [tax] approached Peter and said: “Does YOUR teacher not pay the two drachmas [tax]?”

</br>26 When he said: “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him: “Really, then, the sons are tax-free.

</br>2 So, calling a young child to him, he set it in their midst

</br>4 Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one that is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens;

</br>8 If, then, your hand or your foot is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire.
</br>9 Also, if your eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Ge·hen´na.

</br>14 Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.

</br>15 “Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
</br>16 But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.
</br>17 If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.

</br>27 Moved to pity at this, the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt.

</br>29 Therefore his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay you back.’
</br>30 However, he was not willing, but went off and had him thrown into prison until he should pay back what was owing.

</br>20 The young man said to him: “I have kept all these; what yet am I lacking?”
</br>21 Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.”
</br>22 When the young man heard this saying, he went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions.
</br>23 But Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to YOU that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.
</br>24 Again I say to YOU, It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.”
<p></p>
</br>25 When the disciples heard that, they expressed very great surprise, saying: “Who really can be saved?”
</br>26 Looking them in the face, Jesus said to them: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
<p></p>
</br>27 Then Peter said to him in reply: “Look! We have left all things and followed you; what actually will there be for us?”
</br>28 Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU, In the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, YOU who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
</br>29 And everyone that has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive many times more and will inherit everlasting life.

</br>1 “For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
</br>2 When he had agreed with the workers for a de·nar´i·us a day, he sent them forth into his vineyard.
</br>3 Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;
</br>4 and to those he said, ‘YOU also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is just I will give YOU.’
</br>5 So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.
</br>6 Finally, about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he said to them, ‘Why have YOU been standing here all day unemployed?’
</br>7 They said to him, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘YOU too go into the vineyard.’
<p></p>
</br>8 “When it became evening, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, proceeding from the last to the first.’
</br>9 When the eleventh-hour men came, they each received a de·nar´i·us.
</br>10 So, when the first came, they concluded they would receive more; but they also received pay at the rate of a de·nar´i·us.
</br>11 On receiving it they began to murmur against the householder
</br>12 and said, ‘These last put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’
</br>13 But in reply to one of them he said, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a de·nar´i·us, did you not?
</br>14 Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you.
</br>15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye wicked because I am good?’
</br>16 In this way the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.”
<p></p>
</br>17 Being now about to go up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples off privately and said to them on the road:
</br>18 “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
</br>19 and will deliver him up to [men of] the nations to make fun of and to scourge and to impale, and the third day he will be raised up.”
<p></p>
</br>20 Then the mother of the sons of Zeb´e·dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him.
</br>21 He said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Give the word that these my two sons may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”
</br>22 Jesus said in answer: “YOU men do not know what YOU are asking for. Can YOU drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.”
</br>23 He said to them: “YOU will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
<p></p>
</br>24 When the ten others heard of this, they became indignant at the two brothers.
</br>25 But Jesus, calling them to him, said: “YOU know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.
</br>26 This is not the way among YOU; but whoever wants to become great among YOU must be YOUR minister,
</br>27 and whoever wants to be first among YOU must be YOUR slave.
</br>28 Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.”
<p></p>
</br>29 Now as they were going out of Jer´i·cho a great crowd followed him.
</br>30 And, look! two blind men sitting beside the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
</br>31 But the crowd sternly told them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
</br>32 So Jesus stopped, called them and said: “What do YOU want me to do for YOU?”
</br>33 They said to him: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
</br>34 Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received sight, and they followed him.

</br>1 Well, when they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Beth´pha·ge on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent forth two disciples,
</br>2 saying to them: “Be on YOUR way into the village that is within sight of YOU, and YOU will at once find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.
</br>3 And if someone says anything to YOU, YOU must say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them forth.”
<p></p>
</br>4 This actually took place that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet, saying:
</br>5 “TELL the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! Your King is coming to you, mild-tempered, and mounted upon an ass, yes, upon a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”
<p></p>
</br>6 So the disciples got on their way and did just as Jesus ordered them.
</br>7 And they brought the ass and its colt, and they put upon these their outer garments, and he seated himself upon them.
</br>8 Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
</br>9 As for the crowds, those going ahead of him and those following kept crying out: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”
<p></p>
</br>10 Now when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was set in commotion, saying: “Who is this?”
</br>11 The crowds kept telling: “This is the prophet Jesus, from Naz´a·reth of Gal´i·lee!”
<p></p>
</br>12 And Jesus entered into the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
</br>13 And he said to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but YOU are making it a cave of robbers.”
</br>14 Also, blind and lame persons came up to him in the temple, and he cured them.
<p></p>
</br>15 When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys that were crying out in the temple and saying: “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” they became indignant
</br>16 and said to him: “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes. Did YOU never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise’?”
</br>17 And leaving them behind he went outside the city to Beth´a·ny and passed the night there.
<p></p>
</br>18 While returning to the city early in the morning, he got hungry.
</br>19 And he caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves only, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you anymore forever.” And the fig tree withered instantly.
</br>20 But when the disciples saw this, they wondered, saying: “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”
</br>21 In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU, If only YOU have faith and do not doubt, not only will YOU do what I did to the fig tree, but also if YOU say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.
</br>22 And all the things YOU ask in prayer, having faith, YOU will receive.”
<p></p>
</br>23 Now after he went into the temple, the chief priests and the older men of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: “By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”
</br>24 In reply Jesus said to them: “I, also, will ask YOU one thing. If YOU tell it to me, I also will tell YOU by what authority I do these things:
</br>25 The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?” But they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why, then, did YOU not believe him?’
</br>26 If, though, we say, ‘From men,’ we have the crowd to fear, for they all hold John as a prophet.”
</br>27 So in answer to Jesus they said: “We do not know.” He, in turn, said to them: “Neither am I telling YOU by what authority I do these things.
<p></p>
</br>28 “What do YOU think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in the vineyard.’
</br>29 In answer this one said, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go out.
</br>30 Approaching the second, he said the same. In reply this one said, ‘I will not.’ Afterwards he felt regret and went out.
</br>31 Which of the two did the will of [his] father?” They said: “The latter.” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to YOU that the tax collectors and the harlots are going ahead of YOU into the kingdom of God.
</br>32 For John came to YOU in a way of righteousness, but YOU did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the harlots believed him, and YOU, although YOU saw [this], did not feel regret afterwards so as to believe him.
<p></p>
</br>33 “Hear another illustration: There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad.
</br>34 When the season of the fruits came around, he dispatched his slaves to the cultivators to get his fruits.
</br>35 However, the cultivators took his slaves, and one they beat up, another they killed, another they stoned.
</br>36 Again he dispatched other slaves, more than the first, but they did the same to these.
</br>37 Lastly he dispatched his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
</br>38 On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’
</br>39 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
</br>40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?”
</br>41 They said to him: “Because they are evil, he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.”
<p></p>
</br>42 Jesus said to them: “Did YOU never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
</br>43 This is why I say to YOU, The kingdom of God will be taken from YOU and be given to a nation producing its fruits.
</br>44 Also, the person falling upon this stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.”
<p></p>
</br>45 Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his illustrations, they took note that he was speaking about them.

</br>1 In further reply Jesus again spoke to them with illustrations, saying:
</br>2 “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that made a marriage feast for his son.
</br>3 And he sent forth his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come.
</br>4 Again he sent forth other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’
</br>5 But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his commercial business;
</br>6 but the rest, laying hold of his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.
<p></p>
</br>7 “But the king grew wrathful, and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
</br>8 Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast indeed is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
</br>9 Therefore go to the roads leading out of the city, and anyone YOU find invite to the marriage feast.’
</br>10 Accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered together all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those reclining at the table.
<p></p>
</br>11 “When the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight there of a man not clothed with a marriage garment.
</br>12 So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here not having on a marriage garment?’ He was rendered speechless.
</br>13 Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing of [his] teeth will be.’
<p></p>
</br>14 “For there are many invited, but few chosen.”
<p></p>
</br>15 Then the Pharisees went their way and took counsel together in order to trap him in his speech.
</br>16 So they dispatched to him their disciples, together with party followers of Herod, saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care for anybody, for you do not look upon men’s outward appearance.
</br>17 Tell us, therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?”
</br>18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do YOU put me to the test, hypocrites?
</br>19 Show me the head tax coin.” They brought him a de·nar´i·us.
</br>20 And he said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?”
</br>21 They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”
</br>22 Well, when they heard [that], they marveled, and leaving him they went off.
<p></p>
</br>23 On that day Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up to him and asked him:
</br>24 “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If any man dies without having children, his brother must take his wife in marriage and raise up offspring for his brother.’
</br>25 Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and deceased, and, not having offspring, he left his wife for his brother.
</br>26 It went the same way also with the second and the third, until through all seven.
</br>27 Last of all the woman died.
</br>28 Consequently, in the resurrection, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all got her.”
<p></p>
</br>29 In reply Jesus said to them: “YOU are mistaken, because YOU know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God;
</br>30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
</br>31 As regards the resurrection of the dead, did YOU not read what was spoken to YOU by God, saying,
</br>32 ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.”
</br>33 On hearing [that], the crowds were astounded at his teaching.
<p></p>
</br>34 After the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together in one group.
</br>35 And one of them, versed in the Law, asked, testing him:
</br>36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
</br>37 He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’
</br>38 This is the greatest and first commandment.
</br>39 The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’
</br>40 On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”
<p></p>
</br>41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them:
</br>42 “What do YOU think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David’s.”
</br>43 He said to them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration calls him ‘Lord,’ saying,
</br>44 ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’?
</br>45 If, therefore, David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”

</br>3 For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them,
</br>4 whereas the discreet took oil in their receptacles with their lamps.
</br>5 While the bridegroom was delaying, they all nodded and went to sleep.
</br>6 Right in the middle of the night there arose a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Be on YOUR way out to meet him.’
</br>7 Then all those virgins rose and put their lamps in order.
</br>8 The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of YOUR oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’
</br>9 The discreet answered with the words, ‘Perhaps there may not be quite enough for us and YOU. Be on YOUR way, instead, to those who sell it and buy for yourselves.’
</br>10 While they were going off to buy, the bridegroom arrived, and the virgins that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.
</br>11 Afterwards the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, sir, open to us!’
</br>12 In answer he said, ‘I tell YOU the truth, I do not know YOU.’
<p></p>
</br>13 “Keep on the watch, therefore, because YOU know neither the day nor the hour.
<p></p>
</br>14 “For it is just as when a man, about to travel abroad, summoned slaves of his and committed to them his belongings.
</br>15 And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to still another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went abroad.
</br>16 Immediately the one that received the five talents went his way and did business with them and gained five more.
</br>17 In the same way the one that received the two gained two more.
</br>18 But the one that received just one went off, and dug in the ground and hid the silver money of his master.
<p></p>
</br>19 “After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
</br>20 So the one that had received five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Master, you committed five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’
</br>21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
</br>22 Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more.’
</br>23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
<p></p>
</br>24 “Finally the one that had received the one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be an exacting man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.
</br>25 So I grew afraid and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’
</br>26 In reply his master said to him, ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow?
</br>27 Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what is mine with interest.
<p></p>
</br>28 “‘Therefore TAKE away the talent from him and give it to him that has the ten talents.
</br>29 For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
</br>30 And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing of [his] teeth will be.’
<p></p>
</br>31 “When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.
</br>32 And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
</br>33 And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
<p></p>
</br>34 “Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, YOU who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for YOU from the founding of the world.
</br>35 For I became hungry and YOU gave me something to eat; I got thirsty and YOU gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and YOU received me hospitably;
</br>36 naked, and YOU clothed me. I fell sick and YOU looked after me. I was in prison and YOU came to me.’
</br>37 Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink?
</br>38 When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked, and clothe you?
</br>39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to you?’
</br>40 And in reply the king will say to them, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did it to one of the least of these my brothers, YOU did it to me.’
<p></p>
</br>41 “Then he will say, in turn, to those on his left, ‘Be on YOUR way from me, YOU who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
</br>42 For I became hungry, but YOU gave me nothing to eat, and I got thirsty, but YOU gave me nothing to drink.
</br>43 I was a stranger, but YOU did not receive me hospitably; naked, but YOU did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but YOU did not look after me.’
</br>44 Then they also will answer with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?’
</br>45 Then he will answer them with the words, ‘Truly I say to YOU, To the extent that YOU did not do it to one of these least ones, YOU did not do it to me.’
</br>46 And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”

<p></p>
</br>1 Now when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:
</br>2 “YOU know that two days from now the passover occurs, and the Son of man is to be delivered up to be impaled.”
<p></p>
</br>3 Then the chief priests and the older men of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest who was called Ca´ia·phas,
</br>4 and took counsel together to seize Jesus by crafty device and kill him.
</br>5 However, they kept saying: “Not at the festival, in order that no uproar may arise among the people.”
<p></p>
</br>6 While Jesus happened to be in Beth´a·ny in the house of Simon the leper,
</br>7 a woman with an alabaster case of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it upon his head as he was reclining at the table.
</br>8 On seeing this the disciples became indignant and said: “Why this waste?
</br>9 For this could have been sold for a great deal and been given to poor people.”
</br>10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them: “Why do YOU try to make trouble for the woman? For she did a fine deed toward me.
</br>11 For YOU always have the poor with YOU, but YOU will not always have me.
</br>12 For when this woman put this perfumed oil upon my body, she did it for the preparation of me for burial.
</br>13 Truly I say to YOU, Wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did shall also be told as a remembrance of her.”
<p></p>
</br>14 Then one of the twelve, the one called Judas Is·car´i·ot, went to the chief priests
</br>15 and said: “What will YOU give me to betray him to YOU?” They stipulated to him thirty silver pieces.
</br>16 So from then on he kept seeking a good opportunity to betray him.
<p></p>
</br>17 On the first day of the unfermented cakes the disciples came up to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover?”
</br>18 He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, The Teacher says, ‘My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the passover with my disciples at your home.’”
</br>19 And the disciples did as Jesus ordered them, and they got things ready for the passover.
<p></p>
</br>20 When, now, it had become evening, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
</br>21 While they were eating, he said: “Truly I say to YOU, One of YOU will betray me.”
</br>22 Being very much grieved at this, they commenced each and every one to say to him: “Lord, it is not I, is it?”
</br>23 In reply he said: “He that dips his hand with me in the bowl is the one that will betray me.
</br>24 True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been finer for him if that man had not been born.”
</br>25 By way of reply Judas, who was about to betray him, said: “It is not I, is it, Rabbi?” He said to him: “You yourself said [it].”
<p></p>
</br>26 As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: “TAKE, eat. This means my body.”
</br>27 Also, he took a cup and, having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: “Drink out of it, all of YOU;
</br>28 for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.
</br>29 But I tell YOU, I will by no means drink henceforth any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with YOU in the kingdom of my Father.”
</br>30 Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p></p>
</br>31 Then Jesus said to them: “All of YOU will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.’
</br>32 But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of YOU into Gal´i·lee.”
</br>33 But Peter, in answer, said to him: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, never will I be stumbled!”
</br>34 Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you, On this night, before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.”
</br>35 Peter said to him: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” All the other disciples also said the same thing.
<p></p>
</br>36 Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Geth·sem´a·ne, and he said to the disciples: “Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”
</br>37 And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zeb´e·dee, he started to be grieved and to be sorely troubled.
</br>38 Then he said to them: “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.”
</br>39 And going a little way forward, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”
<p></p>
</br>40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: “Could YOU men not so much as watch one hour with me?
</br>41 Keep on the watch and pray continually, that YOU may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.”
</br>42 Again, for the second time, he went off and prayed, saying: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.”
</br>43 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
</br>44 So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for the third time, saying once more the same word.
</br>45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them: “At such a time as this YOU are sleeping and taking YOUR rest! Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
</br>46 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.”
</br>47 And while he was yet speaking, look! Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and older men of the people.
<p></p>
</br>48 Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying: “Whoever it is I kiss, this is he; take him into custody.”
</br>49 And going straight up to Jesus he said: “Good day, Rabbi!” and kissed him very tenderly.
</br>50 But Jesus said to him: “Fellow, for what purpose are you present?” Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus and took him into custody.
</br>51 But, look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.
</br>52 Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.
</br>53 Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than twelve legions of angels?
</br>54 In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must take place this way?”
</br>55 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: “Have YOU come out with swords and clubs as against a robber to arrest me? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet YOU did not take me into custody.
</br>56 But all this has taken place for the scriptures of the prophets to be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.
<p></p>
</br>57 Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Ca´ia·phas the high priest, where the scribes and the older men were gathered together.
</br>58 But Peter kept following him at a good distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and, after going inside, he was sitting with the house attendants to see the outcome.
<p></p>
</br>59 Meantime the chief priests and the entire San´he·drin were looking for false witness against Jesus in order to put him to death,
</br>60 but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward. Later on two came forward
</br>61 and said: “This man said, ‘I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.’”
</br>62 With that the high priest stood up and said to him: “Have you no answer? What is it these are testifying against you?”
</br>63 But Jesus kept silent. So the high priest said to him: “By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!”
</br>64 Jesus said to him: “You yourself said [it]. Yet I say to YOU men, From henceforth YOU will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
</br>65 Then the high priest ripped his outer garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now YOU have heard the blasphemy.
</br>66 What is YOUR opinion?” They returned answer: “He is liable to death.”
</br>67 Then they spit into his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him in the face,
</br>68 saying: “Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that struck you?”
<p></p>
</br>69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a servant girl came up to him, saying: “You, too, were with Jesus the Gal·i·le´an!”
</br>70 But he denied it before them all, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”
</br>71 After he had gone out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him and said to those there: “This man was with Jesus the Naz·a·rene´.”
</br>72 And again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man!”
</br>73 After a little while those standing around came up and said to Peter: “Certainly you also are one of them, for, in fact, your dialect gives you away.”
</br>74 Then he started to curse and swear: “I do not know the man!” And immediately a cock crowed.
</br>75 And Peter called to mind the saying Jesus spoke, namely: “Before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.

<p></p>
</br>1 When it had become morning, all the chief priests and the older men of the people held a consultation against Jesus so as to put him to death.
</br>2 And, after binding him, they led him off and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
<p></p>
</br>3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing he had been condemned, felt remorse and turned the thirty silver pieces back to the chief priests and older men,
</br>4 saying: “I sinned when I betrayed righteous blood.” They said: “What is that to us? You must see to that!”
</br>5 So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and withdrew, and went off and hanged himself.
</br>6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: “It is not lawful to drop them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.”
</br>7 After consulting together, they bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers.
</br>8 Therefore that field has been called “Field of Blood” to this very day.
</br>9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying: “And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price upon the man that was priced, the one on whom some of the sons of Israel set a price,
</br>10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, according to what Jehovah had commanded me.”
<p></p>
</br>11 Jesus now stood before the governor; and the governor put the question to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied: “You yourself say [it].”
</br>12 But, while he was being accused by the chief priests and older men, he made no answer.
</br>13 Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
</br>14 Yet he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much.
<p></p>
</br>15 Now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, the one they wanted.
</br>16 Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Bar·ab´bas.
</br>17 Hence when they were gathered together Pilate said to them: “Which one do YOU want me to release to YOU, Bar·ab´bas or Jesus the so-called Christ?”
</br>18 For he was aware that out of envy they had handed him over.
</br>19 Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent out to him, saying: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him.”
</br>20 But the chief priests and the older men persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar·ab´bas, but to have Jesus destroyed.
</br>21 Now in responding the governor said to them: “Which of the two do YOU want me to release to YOU?” They said: “Bar·ab´bas.”
</br>22 Pilate said to them: “What, then, shall I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?” They all said: “Let him be impaled!”
</br>23 He said: “Why, what bad thing did he do?” Still they kept crying out all the more: “Let him be impaled!”
<p></p>
</br>24 Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this [man]. YOU yourselves must see to it.”
</br>25 At that all the people said in answer: “His blood come upon us and upon our children.”
</br>26 Then he released Bar·ab´bas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be impaled.
<p></p>
</br>27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace and gathered the whole body of troops together to him.
</br>28 And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak,
</br>29 and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand. And, kneeling before him, they made fun of him, saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!”
</br>30 And they spit upon him and took the reed and began hitting him upon his head.
</br>31 Finally, when they had made fun of him, they took the cloak off and put his outer garments upon him and led him off for impaling.
<p></p>
</br>32 As they were going out they found a native of Cy·re´ne named Simon. This man they impressed into service to lift up his torture stake.
</br>33 And when they came to a place called Gol´go·tha, that is to say, Skull Place,
</br>34 they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink; but, after tasting it, he refused to drink.
</br>35 When they had impaled him they distributed his outer garments by casting lots,
</br>36 and, as they sat, they watched over him there.
</br>37 Also, they posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”
<p></p>
</br>38 Then two robbers were impaled with him, one on his right and one on his left.
</br>39 So the passersby began speaking abusively of him, wagging their heads
</br>40 and saying: “O you would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!”
</br>41 In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and older men began making fun of him and saying:
</br>42 “Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe on him.
</br>43 He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”
</br>44 In the same way even the robbers that were impaled together with him began reproaching him.
<p></p>
</br>45 From the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land, until the ninth hour.
</br>46 About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: “E´li, E´li, la´ma sa·bach·tha´ni?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
</br>47 At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling E·li´jah.”
</br>48 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed and went giving him a drink.
</br>49 But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether E·li´jah comes to save him.” [[Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out.]]
</br>50 Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up [his] spirit.
<p></p>
</br>51 And, look! the curtain of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rock-masses were split.
</br>52 And the memorial tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones that had fallen asleep were raised up,
</br>53 (and persons, coming out from among the memorial tombs after his being raised up, entered into the holy city,) and they became visible to many people.
</br>54 But the army officer and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things happening, grew very much afraid, saying: “Certainly this was God’s Son.”
<p></p>
</br>55 Moreover, many women were there viewing from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Gal´i·lee to minister to him;
</br>56 among whom was Mary Mag´da·lene, also Mary the mother of James and Jo´ses, and the mother of the sons of Zeb´e·dee.
<p></p>
</br>57 Now as it was late in the afternoon, there came a rich man of Ar·i·ma·the´a, named Joseph, who had also himself become a disciple of Jesus.
</br>58 This man went up to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given over.
</br>59 And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen,
</br>60 and laid it in his new memorial tomb, which he had quarried in the rock-mass. And, after rolling a big stone to the door of the memorial tomb, he left.
</br>61 But Mary Mag´da·lene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave.
<p></p>
</br>62 The next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate,
</br>63 saying: “Sir, we have called to mind that that impostor said while yet alive, ‘After three days I am to be raised up.’
</br>64 Therefore command the grave to be made secure until the third day, that his disciples may never come and steal him and say to the people, ‘He was raised up from the dead!’ and this last imposture will be worse than the first.”
</br>65 Pilate said to them: “YOU have a guard. Go make it as secure as YOU know how.”
</br>66 So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and having the guard.
@@libMatthew 
</br>28 :
</br>1 -
</br>20 
<p></p>
</br>1 After the sabbath, when it was growing light on the first day of the week, Mary Mag´da·lene and the other Mary came to view the grave.
<p></p>
</br>2 And, notice! a great earthquake had taken place; for Jehovah’s angel had descended from heaven and approached and rolled away the stone, and was sitting on it.
</br>3 His outward appearance was as lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
</br>4 Yes, for fear of him the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.
<p></p>
</br>5 But the angel in answer said to the women: “Do not YOU be fearful, for I know YOU are looking for Jesus who was impaled.
</br>6 He is not here, for he was raised up, as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.
</br>7 And go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, and, look! he is going ahead of YOU into Gal´i·lee; there YOU will see him. Look! I have told YOU.”
<p></p>
</br>8 So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.
</br>9 And, look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and caught him by his feet and did obeisance to him.
</br>10 Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers, that they may go off into Gal´i·lee; and there they will see me.”
<p></p>
</br>11 While they were on their way, look! some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
</br>12 And after these had gathered together with the older men and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient number of silver pieces to the soldiers
</br>13 and said: “Say, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’
</br>14 And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will persuade [him] and will set YOU free from worry.”
</br>15 So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed; and this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.
<p></p>
</br>16 However, the eleven disciples went into Gal´i·lee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them,
</br>17 and when they saw him they did obeisance, but some doubted.
</br>18 And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.
</br>19 Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,
</br>20 teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU. And, look! I am with YOU all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”
