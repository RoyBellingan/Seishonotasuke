</br>2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘In case some man of YOU would present an offering to Jehovah from the domestic animals, YOU should present YOUR offering from the herd and from the flock.

</br>9 And its intestines and its shanks will be washed with water; and the priest must make all of it smoke on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a restful odor to Jehovah.

</br>5 Moses now said to the assembly: “This is the thing that Jehovah has given command to do.”
</br>6 So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and washed them with water.
</br>7 After that he put the robe upon him and girded him with the sash and clothed him with the sleeveless coat and put the eph´od upon him and girded him with the girdle of the eph´od and bound it closely to him with it.
</br>8 Next he placed the breastpiece upon him and put in the breastpiece the U´rim and the Thum´mim.
</br>9 Then he placed the turban upon his head and placed upon the turban at the forefront of it the shining plate of gold, the holy sign of dedication, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>10 Moses now took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and sanctified them.
</br>11 After that he spattered some of it seven times upon the altar and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand so as to sanctify them.
</br>12 Finally he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him so as to sanctify him.
<p></p>
</br>13 Moses then brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them with robes and girded them with sashes and wrapped the headgear upon them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>14 Then he led up the bull of the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of the sin offering.
</br>15 And Moses proceeded to slaughter it and take the blood and put it with his finger upon the horns of the altar round about and purify the altar from sin, but the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar, that he might sanctify it to make atonement upon it.
</br>16 After that he took all the fat that was upon the intestines, and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and Moses made them smoke upon the altar.
</br>17 And he had the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>18 He now brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons then laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
</br>19 After that Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood round about upon the altar.
</br>20 And he cut up the ram into its pieces, and Moses proceeded to make the head and the pieces and the suet smoke.
</br>21 And the intestines and the shanks he washed with water, and Moses then made the entire ram smoke upon the altar. It was a burnt offering for a restful odor. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>22 Then he brought the second ram, the ram of the installation, near, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the ram’s head.
</br>23 After that Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it upon the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the big toe of his right foot.
</br>24 Next Moses brought Aaron’s sons near and put some of the blood upon the lobe of their right ear and upon the thumb of their right hand and upon the big toe of their right foot; but Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood round about upon the altar.
<p></p>
</br>25 Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was upon the intestines, and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right leg.
</br>26 And out of the basket of unfermented cakes that was before Jehovah he took one unfermented ring-shaped cake and one ring-shaped cake of oiled bread and one wafer. He then placed them upon the fatty pieces and the right leg.
</br>27 After that he put all of them upon the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah.
</br>28 Then Moses took them off their palms and made them smoke upon the altar on top of the burnt offering. They were an installation sacrifice for a restful odor. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
<p></p>
</br>29 And Moses proceeded to take the breast and to wave it to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah. From the installation ram it became the portion for Moses, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<p></p>
</br>30 After that Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was upon the altar and spattered it upon Aaron and his garments and upon his sons and the garments of his sons with him. Thus he sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and the garments of his sons with him.
<p></p>
</br>31 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there is where YOU will eat it and the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was given the command, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’
</br>32 And what is left over of the flesh and the bread YOU will burn with fire.
</br>33 And YOU must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day of fulfilling the days of YOUR installation, because it will take seven days to fill YOUR hand with power.
</br>34 Just as it has been done this day, Jehovah has commanded to be done so as to make atonement for YOU.
</br>35 And YOU will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, and YOU must keep the obligatory watch of Jehovah, that YOU may not die; for so I have been commanded.”
<p></p>
</br>36 And Aaron and his sons proceeded to do all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses.

<p></p>
</br>1 And it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the older men of Israel.
</br>2 Then he said to Aaron: “Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah.
</br>3 But to the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering,
</br>4 and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and a grain offering moistened with oil, because today is when Jehovah will certainly appear to YOU.’”
<p></p>
</br>5 Accordingly they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting. Then the whole assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.
</br>6 And Moses went on to say: “This is the thing that Jehovah has commanded YOU should do, that the glory of Jehovah may appear to YOU.”
</br>7 Then Moses said to Aaron: “Go near to the altar and render up your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement in your own behalf and in behalf of your house; and render up the offering of the people and make atonement in their behalf, just as Jehovah has commanded.”
<p></p>
</br>8 Aaron immediately went near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering that was for him.
</br>9 Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar.
</br>10 And he made the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering smoke upon the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
</br>11 And he burned the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp.
<p></p>
</br>12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it round about upon the altar.
</br>13 And they handed him the burnt offering in its pieces and the head, and he proceeded to make them smoke upon the altar.
</br>14 Further, he washed the intestines and the shanks and made them smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar.
<p></p>
</br>15 He now went presenting the offering of the people and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and made an offering for sin with it as with the first.
</br>16 Then he presented the burnt offering and handled it according to the regular procedure.
<p></p>
</br>17 He next presented the grain offering and filled his hand with some of it and made it smoke upon the altar, apart from the burnt offering of the morning.
<p></p>
</br>18 After that he slaughtered the bull and the ram of the communion sacrifice that was for the people. Then Aaron’s sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it round about upon the altar.
</br>19 As for the fatty pieces of the bull and the fat tail of the ram and the fat covering and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver,
</br>20 they now placed the fatty pieces upon the breasts, after which he made the fatty pieces smoke upon the altar.
</br>21 But the breasts and the right leg Aaron waved to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.
<p></p>
</br>22 Then Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from rendering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices.
</br>23 Finally Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people.
<p></p>
Then Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the people,
</br>24 and fire came out from before Jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar. When all the people got to see it, they broke out into shouting and went falling upon their faces.

</br>1 Later on Aaron’s sons Na´dab and A·bi´hu took up and brought each one his fire holder and put fire in them and placed incense upon it, and they began offering before Jehovah illegitimate fire, which he had not prescribed for them.
</br>2 At this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died before Jehovah.
</br>3 Then Moses said to Aaron: “This is what Jehovah has spoken, saying, ‘Among those near to me let me be sanctified, and before the face of all the people let me be glorified.’” And Aaron kept silent.
<p></p>
</br>4 So Moses called Mish´a·el and El·za´phan, the sons of Uz´zi·el, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them: “Come near, carry YOUR brothers from in front of the holy place to outside the camp.”
</br>5 They accordingly came near and carried them in their robes to outside the camp, just as Moses had spoken.
<p></p>
</br>6 Subsequently Moses said to Aaron and to El·e·a´zar and Ith´a·mar his [other] sons: “Do not let YOUR heads go ungroomed, and YOU must not tear YOUR garments, that YOU may not die and that he may not become indignant against all the assembly; but YOUR brothers of the whole house of Israel will do the weeping over the burning, which Jehovah has made burn.
</br>7 And from the entrance of the tent of meeting YOU must not go out for fear YOU may die, because Jehovah’s anointing oil is upon YOU.” So they did according to Moses’ word.
<p></p>
</br>8 And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Aaron, saying:
</br>9 “Do not drink wine or intoxicating liquor, you and your sons with you, when YOU come into the tent of meeting, that YOU may not die. It is a statute to time indefinite for YOUR generations,
</br>10 both in order to make a distinction between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean,
</br>11 and in order to teach the sons of Israel all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them by means of Moses.”
<p></p>
</br>12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to El·e·a´zar and Ith´a·mar, his sons that were left: “Take the grain offering that was left over from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire and eat it unfermented near the altar, because it is something most holy.
</br>13 And YOU must eat it in a holy place, because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire; for so I have been commanded.
</br>14 And YOU will eat the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because they have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the sons of Israel.
</br>15 They will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings made by fire, of the fatty pieces, in order to wave the wave offering to and fro before Jehovah; and it must serve as an allowance to time indefinite for you and your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.”
<p></p>
</br>16 And Moses searched thoroughly for the goat of the sin offering, and, look! it had been burned up. So he grew indignant at El·e·a´zar and Ith´a·mar, Aaron’s sons that were left, saying:
</br>17 “Why did YOU not eat the sin offering in the place that is holy, since it is something most holy and he has given it to YOU that YOU may answer for the error of the assembly so as to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
</br>18 Look! Its blood has not been brought into the holy place within. YOU should have eaten it without fail in the holy place, just as I had been commanded.”
</br>19 At this Aaron spoke to Moses: “Look! Today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, while such things as these began to befall me; and had I eaten the sin offering today, would it prove satisfactory in Jehovah’s eyes?”
</br>20 When Moses got to hear that, then it proved satisfactory in his eyes.

</br>2 “In case a man develops in the skin of his flesh an eruption or a scab or a blotch and it does develop in the skin of his flesh into the plague of leprosy, he must then be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
</br>3 And the priest must look at the plague in the skin of the flesh. When the hair in the plague has turned white and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy. And the priest must look at it, and he must declare him unclean.
</br>4 But if the blotch is white in the skin of his flesh and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and its hair has not turned white, the priest must then quarantine the plague seven days.
</br>5 And the priest must look at him on the seventh day, and if in the way it looks the plague has stopped, the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest must also quarantine him another seven days.

</br>6 “And the priest must look at him on the seventh day the second time, and if the plague has grown dull and the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest must also pronounce him clean. It was a scab. And he must wash his garments and be clean.
</br>7 But if the scab has unquestionably spread in the skin after his appearing before the priest for the establishment of his purification, he must then appear the second time before the priest,

</br>56 “But if the priest has taken a look, and, there now, the plague is dull after it has been washed out, he must then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.

</br>36 And the priest must give orders, and they must clear out the house before the priest may come in to see the plague, that he may not declare unclean everything that is in the house; and after that the priest will come in to see the house.
</br>37 When he has seen the plague, then if the plague is in the walls of the house, with yellowish-green or reddish depressions, and their appearance is lower than the wall surface,
</br>38 the priest must then go out of the house to the entrance of the house and he must quarantine the house seven days.
<p></p>
</br>39 “And the priest must return on the seventh day and must take a look; and if the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
</br>40 the priest must then give orders, and they must tear out the stones in which the plague is, and they must throw them outside the city into an unclean place.
</br>41 And he will have the house scraped off all around inside, and they must pour the clay mortar that they cut off outside the city into an unclean place.
</br>42 And they must take other stones and insert them in the place of the former stones; and he will have different clay mortar taken, and he must have the house plastered.
<p></p>
</br>43 “If, though, the plague returns and it does break out in the house after having torn out the stones and after having cut off the house and plastered it,
</br>44 the priest must then come in and take a look; and if the plague has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in the house. It is unclean.
</br>45 And he must have the house pulled down with its stones and its timbers and all the clay mortar of the house and must have it carried forth outside the city to an unclean place.
</br>46 But whoever comes into the house any of the days of quarantining it will be unclean until the evening;
</br>47 and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments, and whoever eats in the house should wash his garments.
<p></p>
</br>48 “However, if the priest comes at all and he does take a look, and, there now, the plague has not spread in the house after having plastered the house, the priest must then pronounce the house clean, because the plague has been healed.
</br>49 And to purify the house from sin he must take two birds and cedarwood and coccus scarlet material and hyssop.
</br>50 And he must kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
</br>51 And he must take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the coccus scarlet material and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and he must spatter it toward the house seven times.

</br>55 and respecting the leprosy of the garment and in the house,

</br>5 They should not produce baldness upon their heads, and the extremity of their beard they should not shave, and on their flesh they should not make an incision.

</br>7 A prostitute or a violated woman they should not take; and a woman divorced from her husband they should not take, because he is holy to his God.
</br>8 So you must sanctify him, because he is one presenting the bread of your God. He should prove to be holy to you, because I Jehovah, who am sanctifying YOU, am holy.

</br>9 “‘Now in case the daughter of a priest should make herself profane by committing prostitution, it is her father that she is profaning. She should be burned in the fire.

</br>18 In case there is any man in whom there is a defect, he may not come near: a man blind or lame or with his nose slit or with one member too long,
</br>19 or a man in whom there proves to be a fracture of the foot or a fracture of the hand,
</br>20 or hunchback or thin or diseased in his eyes or scabby or having ringworms or having his testicles broken.

</br>6 The soul who touches any such must be unclean until the evening and may not eat any of the holy things, but he must bathe his flesh in water.
</br>7 When the sun has set, he must also be clean, and afterward he may eat some of the holy things, because it is his bread.

</br>13 But in case the daughter of a priest should become a widow or divorced when she has no offspring, and she must return to her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat some of her father’s bread; but no stranger at all may feed on it.

</br>23 After that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought forth the one who had called down evil to the outside of the camp, and they pelted him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

<p></p>
</br>1 And Jehovah spoke further to Moses in Mount Si´nai, saying:
</br>2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘When YOU eventually come into the land that I am giving YOU, then the land must observe a sabbath to Jehovah.
</br>3 Six years you should sow your field with seed, and six years you should prune your vineyard, and you must gather the land’s produce.
</br>4 But in the seventh year there should occur a sabbath of complete rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. Your field you must not sow with seed, and your vineyard you must not prune.
</br>5 The growth from spilled kernels of your harvest you must not reap, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you must not gather. There should occur a year of complete rest for the land.
</br>6 And the sabbath of the land must serve YOU people for food, for you and your slave man and your slave girl and your hired laborer and the settler with you, those who are residing as aliens with you,
</br>7 and for your domestic animal and for the wild beast that is in your land. All its produce should serve for eating.
<p></p>
</br>8 “‘And you must count for yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and the days of the seven sabbaths of years must amount to forty-nine years for you.
</br>9 And you must cause the horn of loud tone to sound in the seventh month on the tenth of the month; on the day of atonement YOU people should cause the horn to sound in all YOUR land.
</br>10 And YOU must sanctify the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants. It will become a Jubilee for YOU, and YOU must return each one to his possession and YOU should return each one to his family.
</br>11 A Jubilee is what that fiftieth year will become for YOU. YOU must not sow seed nor reap the land’s growth from spilled kernels nor gather the grapes of its unpruned vines.
</br>12 For it is a Jubilee. It should become something holy to YOU. From the field YOU may eat what the land produces.
<p></p>
</br>13 “‘In this year of the Jubilee YOU should return each one to his possession.
</br>14 Now in case YOU should sell merchandise to your associate or be buying from your associate’s hand, do not YOU wrong one another.
</br>15 By the number of the years after the Jubilee you should buy from your associate; by the number of the years of the crops he should sell to you.
</br>16 In proportion to the great number of years he should increase its purchase value, and in proportion to the fewness of years he should reduce its purchase value, because the number of the crops is what he is selling to you.
</br>17 And YOU must not wrong anyone his associate, and you must be in fear of your God, because I am Jehovah YOUR God.
</br>18 So YOU must carry out my statutes and YOU should keep my judicial decisions and YOU must carry them out. Then YOU will certainly dwell on the land in security.
</br>19 And the land will indeed give its fruitage, and YOU will certainly eat to satisfaction and dwell in security on it.
<p></p>
</br>20 “‘But in case YOU should say: “What are we going to eat in the seventh year seeing that we may not sow seed or gather our crops?”
</br>21 in that case I shall certainly command my blessing for YOU in the sixth year, and it must yield its crop for three years.
</br>22 And YOU must sow seed the eighth year and YOU must eat from the old crop until the ninth year. Until the coming of its crop YOU will eat the old.
<p></p>
</br>23 “‘So the land should not be sold in perpetuity, because the land is mine. For YOU are alien residents and settlers from my standpoint.
</br>24 And in all the land of YOUR possession YOU should grant to the land the right of buying back.
<p></p>
</br>25 “‘In case your brother grows poor and has to sell some of his possession, a repurchaser closely related to him must also come and buy back what his brother sold.
</br>26 And in case anyone proves to have no repurchaser and his own hand does make gain and he does find enough for its repurchase,
</br>27 he must also calculate the years from when he sold it and he must return what money remains over to the man to whom he made the sale, and he must return to his possession.
<p></p>
</br>28 “‘But if his hand does not find enough to give back to him, what he sold must also continue in the hand of its purchaser until the Jubilee year; and it must go out in the Jubilee, and he must return to his possession.
<p></p>
</br>29 “‘Now in case a man should sell a dwelling house in a walled city, his right of repurchase must also continue till the year from the time of his sale finishes out; his right of repurchase should continue a whole year.
</br>30 But if it should not be bought back before the complete year has come to the full for him, the house that is in the city that has a wall must also stand in perpetuity as the property of its purchaser during his generations. It should not go out in the Jubilee.
</br>31 However, the houses of settlements that have no wall about them should be accounted as part of the field of the country. Right of repurchase should continue for it, and in the Jubilee it should go out.
<p></p>
</br>32 “‘As for cities of the Levites with the houses of the cities of their possession, the right of repurchase should continue to time indefinite for the Levites.
</br>33 And where property of the Levites is not bought back, the house sold in the city of his possession must also go out in the Jubilee; because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.
</br>34 Moreover, the field of pasture ground of their cities may not be sold, because it is a possession to time indefinite for them.
<p></p>
</br>35 “‘And in case your brother grows poor and so he is financially weak alongside you, you must also sustain him. As an alien resident and a settler, he must keep alive with you.
</br>36 Do not take interest and usury from him, but you must be in fear of your God; and your brother must keep alive with you.
</br>37 You must not give him your money on interest, and you must not give your food out on usury.
</br>38 I am Jehovah YOUR God, who brought YOU out of the land of Egypt to give YOU the land of Ca´naan, to prove myself YOUR God.
<p></p>
</br>39 “‘And in case your brother grows poor alongside you and he has to sell himself to you, you must not use him as a worker in slavish service.
</br>40 He should prove to be with you like a hired laborer, like a settler. He should serve with you till the Jubilee year.
</br>41 And he must go out from you, he and his sons with him, and he must return to his family, and he should return to the possession of his forefathers.
</br>42 For they are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They must not sell themselves the way a slave is sold.
</br>43 You must not tread down upon him with tyranny, and you must be in fear of your God.
</br>44 As for your slave man and your slave girl who become yours from the nations that are round about YOU people, from them YOU may buy a slave man and a slave girl.
</br>45 And also from the sons of the settlers who are residing as aliens with YOU, from them YOU may buy, and from their families that are with YOU whom they had born to them in YOUR land; and they must become YOUR possession.
</br>46 And YOU must pass them on as an inheritance to YOUR sons after YOU to inherit as a possession to time indefinite. YOU may use them as workers, but upon YOUR brothers the sons of Israel, you must not tread, the one upon the other, with tyranny.
<p></p>
</br>47 “‘But in case the hand of the alien resident or the settler with you becomes wealthy, and your brother has become poor alongside him and must sell himself to the alien resident or the settler with you, or to a member of the family of the alien resident,
</br>48 after he has sold himself, the right of repurchase will continue in his case. One of his brothers may buy him back.
</br>49 Or his uncle or the son of his uncle may buy him back, or any blood relative of his flesh, one of his family, may buy him back.
<p></p>
“‘Or if his own hand has become wealthy, he must also buy himself back.
</br>50 And he must reckon with his purchaser from the year he sold himself to him till the Jubilee year, and the money of his sale must correspond with the number of years. The way workdays of a hired laborer are reckoned he should continue with him.
</br>51 If there are yet many years, he should in proportion to them pay his repurchase price over from the money of his purchase.
</br>52 But if only a few remain of the years until the Jubilee year, he must then make a calculation for himself. In proportion to the years of his he should pay over his repurchase price.
</br>53 He should continue with him like a hired laborer from year to year. He may not tread him down with tyranny before your eyes.
</br>54 However, if he cannot buy himself back on these terms, he must then go out in the year of Jubilee, he and his sons with him.
<p></p>
</br>55 “‘For to me the sons of Israel are slaves. They are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah YOUR God.

</br>20 And YOUR power will simply be expended for nothing, as YOUR earth will not give its yield, and the tree of the earth will not give its fruit.
<p></p>

</br>29 So YOU will have to eat the flesh of YOUR sons, and YOU will eat the flesh of YOUR daughters.
</br>30 And I shall certainly annihilate YOUR sacred high places and cut off YOUR incense stands and lay YOUR own carcasses upon the carcasses of YOUR dungy idols; and my soul will simply abhor YOU.
</br>31 And I shall indeed give YOUR cities to the sword and lay YOUR sanctuaries desolate, and I shall not smell YOUR restful odors.
</br>32 And I, for my part, will lay the land desolate, and YOUR enemies who are dwelling in it will simply stare in amazement over it.

</br>37 And they will certainly stumble against one another as if from before a sword without anyone chasing, and for YOU there will prove to be no ability to stand [in resistance] before YOUR enemies.
</br>38 And YOU must perish among the nations, and the land of YOUR enemies must eat YOU up.

</br>40 And they will certainly confess their own error and the error of their fathers in their unfaithfulness when they behaved unfaithfully toward me, yes, even when they walked in opposition to me.
</br>41 Yet I, for my part, proceeded to walk in opposition to them, and I had to bring them into the land of their enemies.
<p></p>
“‘Perhaps at that time their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, and at that time they will pay off their error.
</br>42 And I shall indeed remember my covenant with Jacob; and even my covenant with Isaac and even my covenant with Abraham I shall remember, and the land I shall remember.

</br>46 These are the regulations and the judicial decisions and the laws that Jehovah set between himself and the sons of Israel in Mount Si´nai by means of Moses.
@@libLeviticus 
</br>27 :
</br>1 -
</br>34 
<p></p>
</br>1 And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:
</br>2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘In case a man makes a special vow offering of souls to Jehovah according to the estimated value,
</br>3 and the estimated value has to be of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, the estimated value must then become fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.
</br>4 But if it is a female, the estimated value must then become thirty shekels.
</br>5 And if the age is from five years old up to twenty years old, the estimated value of the male must then become twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
</br>6 And if the age is from a month old up to five years old, the estimated value of the male must then become five shekels of silver and for the female the estimated value must be three shekels of silver.
<p></p>
</br>7 “‘Now if the age is from sixty years old upward, if it is a male, the estimated value must then become fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.
</br>8 But if he has become too poor for the estimated value, he must then stand the person before the priest, and the priest must put a valuation upon him. According to what the vower can afford, the priest will put a valuation upon him.
<p></p>
</br>9 “‘And if it is a beast such as one presents in offering to Jehovah, everything of what he may give to Jehovah will become something holy.
</br>10 He may not replace it, and he may not exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good. But if he should exchange it at all with beast for beast, it itself must then become and what is exchanged for it should become something holy.
</br>11 And if it is any unclean beast such as one may not present in offering to Jehovah, he must then stand the beast before the priest.
</br>12 And the priest must put a valuation upon it whether it is good or bad. According to the value estimated by the priest, so it should become.
</br>13 But if he wants to buy it back at all, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the estimated value.
<p></p>
</br>14 “‘Now in case a man should sanctify his house as something holy to Jehovah, the priest must then make a valuation of it whether it is good or bad. According to what valuation the priest makes of it, so much it should cost.
</br>15 But if the sanctifier wants to buy his house back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it; and it must become his.
<p></p>
</br>16 “‘And if it is some of the field of his possession that a man would sanctify to Jehovah, the value must then be estimated in proportion to its seed: if a ho´mer of barley seed, then at fifty shekels of silver.
</br>17 If he should sanctify his field from the year of Jubilee on, it should cost according to the estimated value.
</br>18 And if it is after the Jubilee that he sanctifies his field, the priest must then calculate for him the price in proportion to the years that are left over until the next year of Jubilee, and a deduction should be made from the estimated value.
</br>19 But if the sanctifier of it would at all buy the field back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it must stand fast as his.
</br>20 Now if he should not buy the field back but if the field is sold to another man, it may not be bought back again.
</br>21 And the field when it goes out in the Jubilee must become something holy to Jehovah, as a field that is devoted. The possession of it will become the priest’s.
<p></p>
</br>22 “‘And if he sanctifies to Jehovah a field purchased by him that is no part of the field of his possession,
</br>23 the priest must then calculate for him the amount of the valuation up till the year of Jubilee, and he must give the estimated value on that day. It is something holy to Jehovah.
</br>24 In the year of Jubilee the field will return to the one from whom he bought it, to the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.
<p></p>
</br>25 “‘Now every value should be estimated in the shekel of the holy place. The shekel should amount to twenty ge´rahs.
<p></p>
</br>26 “‘Only the firstborn among beasts, which is born as the firstborn for Jehovah, no man should sanctify it. Whether bull or sheep, it belongs to Jehovah.
</br>27 And if it is among the unclean beasts and he must redeem it according to the estimated value, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it should not be bought back, it must then be sold according to the estimated value.
<p></p>
</br>28 “‘Only no sort of devoted thing that a man might devote to Jehovah for destruction out of all that is his, whether from mankind or beasts or from the field of his possession, may be sold, and no sort of devoted thing may be bought back. It is something most holy to Jehovah.
</br>29 No devoted person who might be devoted to destruction from among mankind may be redeemed. He should be put to death without fail.
<p></p>
</br>30 “‘And every tenth part of the land, out of the seed of the land and the fruit of the tree, belongs to Jehovah. It is something holy to Jehovah.
</br>31 And if a man wants to buy any of his tenth part back at all, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it.
</br>32 As for every tenth part of the herd and flock, everything that passes under the crook, the tenth head should become something holy to Jehovah.
</br>33 He should not examine whether it is good or bad, neither should he exchange it. But if he would exchange it at all, it itself must then become and what is exchanged for it should become something holy. It may not be bought back.’”
<p></p>
</br>34 These are the commandments that Jehovah gave Moses as commands to the sons of Israel in Mount Si´nai.
