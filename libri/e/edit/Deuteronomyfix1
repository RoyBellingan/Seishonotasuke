<p></p>
</br>1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the region of the Jordan in the wilderness, on the desert plains in front of Suph, between Pa´ran and To´phel and La´ban and Ha·ze´roth and Di´za·hab,
</br>2 it being eleven days from Ho´reb by the way of Mount Se´ir to Ka´desh-bar´ne·a.
</br>3 And it came about that in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses spoke to the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah had commanded him for them,
</br>4 after his defeating Si´hon the king of the Am´or·ites, who was dwelling in Hesh´bon, and Og the king of Ba´shan, who was dwelling in Ash´ta·roth, in Ed´re·i.
</br>5 In the region of the Jordan in the land of Mo´ab Moses undertook to explain this law, saying:
<p></p>
</br>6 “Jehovah our God spoke to us in Ho´reb, saying, ‘YOU have dwelt long enough in this mountainous region.
</br>7 Turn and set out on YOUR way and go into the mountainous region of the Am´or·ites and to all their neighbors in the Ar´a·bah, the mountainous region and the She·phe´lah and the Neg´eb and the seacoast, the land of the Ca´naan·ites, and Leb´a·non, up to the great river, the river Eu·phra´tes.
</br>8 See, I do put the land before YOU people. Go in and take possession of the land about which Jehovah swore to YOUR fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give it to them and their seed after them.’
<p></p>
</br>9 “And I proceeded to say this to YOU at that particular time, ‘I am not able by myself to carry YOU.
</br>10 Jehovah YOUR God has multiplied YOU, and here YOU are today like the stars of the heavens for multitude.
</br>11 May Jehovah the God of YOUR forefathers increase YOU a thousand times as many as YOU are, and may he bless YOU just as he has promised YOU.
</br>12 How can I carry by myself the burden of YOU and the load of YOU and YOUR quarreling?
</br>13 Get wise and discreet and experienced men of YOUR tribes, that I may set them as heads over YOU.’
</br>14 At that YOU answered me and said, ‘The thing you have spoken for us to do is good.’
</br>15 So I took the heads of YOUR tribes, men wise and experienced, and put them as heads over YOU, chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds and chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens and officers of YOUR tribes.
<p></p>
</br>16 “And I went on to command YOUR judges at that particular time, saying, ‘When having a hearing between YOUR brothers, YOU must judge with righteousness between a man and his brother or his alien resident.
</br>17 YOU must not be partial in judgment. YOU should hear the little one the same as the great one. YOU must not become frightened because of a man, for the judgment belongs to God; and the case that is too hard for YOU, YOU should present to me, and I must hear it.’
</br>18 And I proceeded to command YOU at that particular time all the things that YOU should do.
<p></p>
</br>19 “Then we pulled away from Ho´reb and went marching through all that great and fear-inspiring wilderness, which YOU have seen, by the way of the mountainous region of the Am´or·ites, just as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we eventually came to Ka´desh-bar´ne·a.
</br>20 I now said to YOU, ‘YOU have come to the mountainous region of the Am´or·ites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.
</br>21 See, Jehovah your God has abandoned the land to you. Go up, take possession, just as Jehovah the God of your forefathers has spoken to you. Do not be afraid, nor be terrified.’
<p></p>
</br>22 “However, all of YOU came near to me and said, ‘Do let us send men ahead of us that they may search out the land for us and bring us back word concerning the way by which we should go up and the cities to which we will come.’
</br>23 Well, the thing proved to be good in my eyes, so that I took twelve men of YOURS, one for each tribe.
</br>24 Then they turned and went up into the mountainous region and got as far as the torrent valley of Esh´col and went spying on it.
</br>25 And they proceeded to take some of the fruitage of the land in their hand and to bring it down to us, and they came bringing us back word and saying, ‘The land that Jehovah our God is giving us is good.’
</br>26 But YOU did not wish to go up, and YOU began to behave rebelliously against the order of Jehovah YOUR God.
</br>27 And YOU kept grumbling in YOUR tents and saying, ‘It was because Jehovah hated us that he brought us out of the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Am´or·ites, to annihilate us.
</br>28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have caused our heart to melt, saying: “A people greater and taller than we are, cities great and fortified to the heavens and also the sons of the An´a·kim we saw there.”’
<p></p>
</br>29 “So I said to YOU, ‘YOU must not suffer a shock or be afraid because of them.
</br>30 Jehovah YOUR God is the one going before YOU. He will fight for YOU according to all that he did with YOU in Egypt under YOUR own eyes,
</br>31 and in the wilderness, where you saw how Jehovah your God carried you just as a man carries his son, in all the way that YOU walked until YOUR coming to this place.’
</br>32 But despite this word YOU were not putting faith in Jehovah YOUR God,
</br>33 who was going before YOU in the way to spy out for YOU a place for YOU to camp, by fire at night for YOU to see by what way YOU should walk and by a cloud in daytime.
<p></p>
</br>34 “All the while Jehovah heard the voice of YOUR words. So he became indignant and swore, saying,
</br>35 ‘Not one among these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to YOUR fathers,
</br>36 except Ca´leb the son of Je·phun´neh. He will see it, and to him and to his sons I shall give the land upon which he trod, by reason of the fact that he has followed Jehovah fully.
</br>37 (Even against me Jehovah got incensed on YOUR account, saying, ‘You too will not go in there.
</br>38 Joshua the son of Nun, who is standing before you, is the one who will go in there.’ Him he has made strong, because he will cause Israel to inherit it.)
</br>39 As for YOUR little ones of whom YOU said: “Plunder they will become!” and YOUR sons who today do not know good or bad, these will go in there, and to them I shall give it, and they will take possession of it.
</br>40 As for YOU yourselves, change your direction and pull away for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’
<p></p>
</br>41 “At this YOU answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Jehovah. We—we shall go up and fight in accord with all that Jehovah our God has commanded us!’ So YOU girded on, each one, his weapons of war and regarded it as easy to go up into the mountain.
</br>42 But Jehovah said to me, ‘Say to them: “YOU must not go up and fight, because I am not in YOUR midst; that YOU may not be defeated before YOUR enemies.”’
</br>43 So I spoke to YOU, and YOU did not listen but began to behave rebelliously against Jehovah’s order and to get all heated up, and you tried to go up into the mountain.
</br>44 Then the Am´or·ites who were dwelling in that mountain came out to meet YOU and went chasing YOU, just as bees do, and scattering YOU in Se´ir as far as Hor´mah.
</br>45 After that YOU returned and began to weep before Jehovah, but Jehovah did not listen to YOUR voice, neither did he give ear to YOU.
</br>46 So YOU kept dwelling in Ka´desh many days, as many days as YOU did dwell there.

<p></p>
</br>1 “Then we turned and pulled away for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, just as Jehovah had spoken to me; and we were many days in going around Mount Se´ir.
</br>2 Finally Jehovah said this to me,
</br>3 ‘YOU have gone around this mountain long enough. Change YOUR direction to the north.
</br>4 And command the people, saying: “YOU are passing along by the border of YOUR brothers, the sons of E´sau, who are dwelling in Se´ir; and they will be afraid because of YOU, and YOU must be very careful.
</br>5 Do not engage in strife with them, because I shall not give YOU of their land so much as the width of the sole of the foot; because I have given Mount Se´ir to E´sau as a holding.
</br>6 What food YOU may buy from them for money, YOU must eat; and also what water YOU may purchase from them for money, YOU must drink.
</br>7 For Jehovah your God has blessed you in every deed of your hand. He well knows of your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years Jehovah your God has been with you. You have not lacked a thing.”’
</br>8 So we passed on away from our brothers, the sons of E´sau, who are dwelling in Se´ir, from the way of the Ar´a·bah, from E´lath and from E´zi·on-ge´ber.
<p></p>
“Next we turned and passed on by the way of the wilderness of Mo´ab.
</br>9 Jehovah then said to me, ‘Do not molest Mo´ab or engage in war with them, because I shall not give you any of his land as a holding, for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar as a holding.
</br>10 (The E´mim dwelt in it in former times, a people great and numerous and tall like the An´a·kim.
</br>11 As for the Reph´a·im, they also were considered like the An´a·kim, and the Mo´ab·ites used to call them E´mim.
</br>12 And the Hor´ites dwelt in Se´ir in former times, and the sons of E´sau proceeded to dispossess them and to annihilate them from before them and to dwell in their place, just the same as Israel must do to the land that is his holding, which Jehovah will certainly give to them.)
</br>13 At this time rise and make YOUR way across the torrent valley of Ze´red.’ Accordingly we went crossing the torrent valley of Ze´red.
</br>14 And the days that we walked from Ka´desh-bar´ne·a until we crossed the torrent valley of Ze´red were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war had come to their end from the midst of the camp, just as Jehovah had sworn to them.
</br>15 And the hand of Jehovah also proved to be upon them to disquiet them out of the midst of the camp, until they came to their end.
<p></p>
</br>16 “And it came about that as soon as all the men of war had finished dying off from the midst of the people,
</br>17 Jehovah spoke further to me, saying,
</br>18 ‘You are passing today by the territory of Mo´ab, that is, Ar,
</br>19 and you must get close in front of the sons of Am´mon. Do not molest them or engage in strife with them, because I shall not give you any of the land of the sons of Am´mon as a holding, for it is to the sons of Lot that I have given it as a holding.
</br>20 As the land of the Reph´a·im it also used to be considered. (The Reph´a·im dwelt in it in former times, and the Am´mon·ites used to call them Zam·zum´mim.
</br>21 They were a great and numerous and tall people like the An´a·kim; and Jehovah went annihilating them from before them, that they might dispossess them and dwell in their place;
</br>22 just the same as he did for the sons of E´sau, who are dwelling in Se´ir, when he annihilated the Hor´ites from before them, that they might dispossess them and dwell in their place until this day.
</br>23 As for the Av´vim, who were dwelling in settlements as far as Ga´za, the Caph´to·rim, who came out from Caph´tor, annihilated them, that they might dwell in their place.)
<p></p>
</br>24 “‘GET up, pull away and cross the torrent valley of Ar´non. See, I have given into your hand Si´hon the king of Hesh´bon, the Am´or·ite. So start to take possession of his land, and engage in war with him.
</br>25 This day I shall start to put the dread of you and the fear of you before the peoples beneath all the heavens, who will hear the report about you; and they will indeed be agitated and have pains like those of childbirth because of you.’
<p></p>
</br>26 “Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Ked´e·moth to Si´hon the king of Hesh´bon with words of peace, saying,
</br>27 ‘Let me pass through your land. Only on the road I shall walk. I shall not turn to the right or to the left.
</br>28 What food you will sell me for money, I must eat; and what water you will give me for money, I must drink. Only let me pass through on my feet,
</br>29 just the same as the sons of E´sau dwelling in Se´ir and the Mo´ab·ites dwelling in Ar did to me, until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land that Jehovah our God is giving to us.’
</br>30 And Si´hon the king of Hesh´bon did not let us pass through him, because Jehovah your God had let his spirit become obstinate and his heart become hard, in order to give him into your hand just as at this day.
<p></p>
</br>31 “At this Jehovah said to me, ‘See, I have started to abandon Si´hon and his land to you. Start to take possession of his land.’
</br>32 When Si´hon came on out, he and all his people, to meet us in battle at Ja´haz,
</br>33 then Jehovah our God abandoned him to us, so that we defeated him and his sons and all his people.
</br>34 And we went capturing all his cities at that particular time and devoting every city to destruction, men and women and little children. We left no survivor.
</br>35 Only the domestic animals did we take as plunder for ourselves, together with the spoil of the cities that we had captured.
</br>36 From A·ro´er, which is by the bank of the torrent valley of Ar´non, and the city that is in the torrent valley, as far as Gil´e·ad, there proved to be no town that was too high up for us. Jehovah our God abandoned them all to us.
</br>37 Only you did not go near the land of the sons of Am´mon, the whole bank of the torrent valley of Jab´bok, nor the cities of the mountainous region, nor anything about which Jehovah our God had given command.

<p></p>
</br>1 “Then we turned and went up by the way of Ba´shan. At this Og the king of Ba´shan came on out, he and all his people, to meet us in battle at Ed´re·i.
</br>2 So Jehovah said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I shall certainly give him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you must do to him just as you did to Si´hon the king of the Am´or·ites, who was dwelling in Hesh´bon.’
</br>3 Accordingly Jehovah our God gave into our hand also Og the king of Ba´shan and all his people, and we kept striking him until he had no survivor remaining.
</br>4 And we went capturing all his cities at that particular time. There proved to be no town that we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Ar´gob, the kingdom of Og in Ba´shan.
</br>5 All these were cities fortified with a high wall, doors and bar, aside from very many rural towns.
</br>6 However, we devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to Si´hon the king of Hesh´bon, in devoting every city to destruction, men, women and little children.
</br>7 And all the domestic animals and the spoil of the cities we took as plunder for ourselves.
<p></p>
</br>8 “And we proceeded to take at that particular time the land from the hand of the two kings of the Am´or·ites who were in the region of the Jordan, from the torrent valley of Ar´non as far as Mount Her´mon;
</br>9 (the Si·do´ni·ans used to call Her´mon Sir´i·on, and the Am´or·ites used to call it Se´nir,)
</br>10 all the cities of the tableland and all Gil´e·ad and all Ba´shan as far as Sal´e·cah and Ed´re·i, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Ba´shan.
</br>11 For only Og the king of Ba´shan remained of what was left of the Reph´a·im. Look! His bier was a bier of iron. Is it not in Rab´bah of the sons of Am´mon? Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits its width, by the cubit of a man.
</br>12 And we took possession of this land at that particular time; from A·ro´er, which is by the torrent valley of Ar´non, and half of the mountainous region of Gil´e·ad, and its cities I have given to the Reu´ben·ites and the Gad´ites.
</br>13 And the rest of Gil´e·ad and all Ba´shan of the kingdom of Og I have given to the half tribe of Ma·nas´seh. All the region of Ar´gob of all Ba´shan, is it not called the land of the Reph´a·im?
<p></p>
</br>14 “Ja´ir the son of Ma·nas´seh took all the region of Ar´gob as far as the boundary of the Gesh´ur·ites and the Ma·ac´a·thites, and he proceeded to call those villages of Ba´shan by his own name, Hav´voth-ja´ir, to this day.
</br>15 And to Ma´chir I have given Gil´e·ad.
</br>16 And to the Reu´ben·ites and the Gad´ites I have given from Gil´e·ad to the torrent valley of Ar´non, the middle of the torrent valley being a boundary, and as far as Jab´bok, the torrent valley that is the boundary of the sons of Am´mon;
</br>17 and the Ar´a·bah and the Jordan and the border, from Chin´ne·reth to the sea of the Ar´a·bah, the Salt Sea, at the base of the slopes of Pis´gah toward the sunrising.
<p></p>
</br>18 “So I commanded YOU men at that particular time, saying, ‘Jehovah YOUR God has given YOU this land to take possession of it. YOU will pass over, equipped, before YOUR brothers, the sons of Israel, all the valiant men.
</br>19 Only YOUR wives and YOUR little ones and YOUR livestock (I well know that YOU have a great deal of livestock) will continue dwelling in YOUR cities that I have given YOU,
</br>20 until Jehovah gives YOUR brothers rest, as well as YOU, and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah YOUR God is giving them across the Jordan; after which YOU must come back, each one to his holding that I have given YOU.’
<p></p>
</br>21 “And I commanded Joshua at that particular time, saying, ‘Your eyes are seeing all that Jehovah YOUR God has done to these two kings. The same way Jehovah will do to all the kingdoms to which you are passing over there.
</br>22 YOU men must not be afraid of them, for Jehovah YOUR God is the One fighting for YOU.’
<p></p>
</br>23 “And I proceeded to implore favor from Jehovah at that particular time, saying,
</br>24 ‘O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you yourself have started to make your servant see your greatness and your strong arm, for who is a god in the heavens or on the earth that does deeds like yours and mighty performances like yours?
</br>25 Let me pass over, please, and see the good land that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous region and Leb´a·non.’
</br>26 And Jehovah continued to be furious against me on YOUR account and did not listen to me; but Jehovah said to me, ‘That is enough of you! Never speak to me further on this matter.
</br>27 Go up to the top of Pis´gah and raise your eyes to the west and north and south and east and see with your eyes, for you will not pass over this Jordan.
</br>28 And commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one to pass over before this people and he is the one to cause them to inherit the land that you will see.’

</br>2 YOU must not add to the word that I am commanding YOU, neither must YOU take away from it, so as to keep the commandments of Jehovah YOUR God that I am commanding YOU.
<p></p>
</br>3 “YOUR own eyes are the ones that saw what Jehovah did in the case of the Ba´al of Pe´or, that every man who walked after the Ba´al of Pe´or was the one whom Jehovah your God annihilated from your midst.
</br>4 But YOU who are cleaving to Jehovah YOUR God are all of YOU alive today.
</br>5 See, I have taught YOU regulations and judicial decisions, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, for YOU to do that way in the midst of the land to which YOU are going to take possession of it.
</br>6 And YOU must keep and do them, because this is wisdom on YOUR part and understanding on YOUR part before the eyes of the peoples who will hear of all these regulations, and they will certainly say, ‘This great nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people.’
</br>7 For what great nation is there that has gods near to it the way Jehovah our God is in all our calling upon him?
</br>8 And what great nation is there that has righteous regulations and judicial decisions like all this law that I am putting before YOU today?

<p></p>
</br>11 “So YOU people came near and stood at the base of the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to midheaven; there was darkness, cloud and thick gloom.
</br>12 And Jehovah began to speak to YOU out of the middle of the fire. The sound of words was what YOU were hearing, but no form were YOU seeing—nothing but a voice.
</br>13 And he proceeded to state to YOU his covenant, which he commanded YOU to perform—the Ten Words, after which he wrote them upon two tablets of stone.
</br>14 And it was I whom Jehovah commanded at that particular time to teach YOU regulations and judicial decisions, for YOU to do them in the land to which YOU are passing over to take possession of it.
<p></p>
</br>15 “And YOU must take good care of YOUR souls, because YOU did not see any form on the day of Jehovah’s speaking to YOU in Ho´reb out of the middle of the fire,
</br>16 that YOU may not act ruinously and may not really make for yourselves a carved image, the form of any symbol, the representation of male or female,
</br>17 the representation of any beast that is in the earth, the representation of any winged bird that flies in the heavens,
</br>18 the representation of anything moving on the ground, the representation of any fish that is in the waters under the earth;
</br>19 and that you may not raise your eyes to the heavens and indeed see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of the heavens, and actually get seduced and bow down to them and serve them, which Jehovah your God has apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens.
</br>20 But YOU are the ones Jehovah took that he might bring YOU out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to become a people of private ownership to him as at this day.
<p></p>
</br>21 “And Jehovah got incensed at me on YOUR account, so that he swore that I should not cross the Jordan or go into the good land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.
</br>22 For I am dying in this land. I am not crossing the Jordan, but YOU are crossing, and YOU must take possession of this good land.
</br>23 Watch out for yourselves that YOU may not forget the covenant of Jehovah YOUR God that he concluded with YOU and that YOU do not make for yourselves a carved image, the form of anything about which Jehovah your God has commanded you.
</br>24 For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, a God exacting exclusive devotion.
<p></p>
</br>25 “In case you become father to sons and grandsons and YOU have resided a long time in the land and do act ruinously and do make a carved image, a form of anything, and do commit evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God so as to offend him,
</br>26 I do take as witnesses against YOU today the heavens and the earth, that YOU will positively perish in a hurry from off the land to which YOU are crossing the Jordan to take possession of it. YOU will not lengthen YOUR days on it, because YOU will positively be annihilated.
</br>27 And Jehovah will certainly scatter YOU among the peoples, and YOU will indeed be let remain few in number among the nations to which Jehovah will drive YOU away.
</br>28 And there YOU will have to serve gods, the product of the hands of man, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
<p></p>
</br>29 “If YOU do look for Jehovah your God from there, you will also certainly find him, because you will inquire for him with all your heart and with all your soul.
</br>30 When you are in sore straits and all these words have found you out at the close of the days, then you will have to return to Jehovah your God and to listen to his voice.
</br>31 For Jehovah your God is a merciful God. He will not desert you or bring you to ruin or forget the covenant of your forefathers that he swore to them.
<p></p>
</br>32 “Now ask, please, concerning the former days that occurred before you, from the day that God created man on the earth and from one end of the heavens clear to the other end of the heavens, Was any great thing brought about like this or was anything heard like it?
</br>33 Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire the way you yourself have heard it, and kept on living?
</br>34 Or did God attempt to come to take a nation to himself out of the midst of another nation with provings, with signs and with miracles and with war and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great fearsomeness like all that Jehovah YOUR God has done for YOU in Egypt before your eyes?
</br>35 You—you have been shown, so as to know that Jehovah is the [true] God; there is no other besides him.
</br>36 Out of the heavens he made you hear his voice so as to correct you; and upon the earth he made you see his great fire, and his words you heard from the middle of the fire.
<p></p>
</br>37 “And [yet you continue to live], because he loved your forefathers so that he chose their seed after them and brought you out of Egypt in his sight with his great power,
</br>38 to drive away nations greater and mightier than you from before you, so as to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance as at this day.
</br>39 And you well know today, and you must call back to your heart that Jehovah is the [true] God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. There is no other.
</br>40 And you must keep his regulations and his commandments that I am commanding you today, that it may go well with you and your sons after you, and in order that you may lengthen your days on the soil that Jehovah your God is giving you, always.”

</br>41 At that time Moses proceeded to set apart three cities on the side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun,
</br>42 for the manslayer to flee there who slays his fellow without knowing it, while he was not hating him formerly; and he must flee to one of these cities and live,
</br>43 namely, Be´zer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reu´ben·ites, and Ra´moth in Gil´e·ad for the Gad´ites, and Go´lan in Ba´shan for the Ma·nas´sites.

</br>45 These are the testimonies and the regulations and the judicial decisions that Moses spoke to the sons of Israel on their coming out of Egypt,
</br>46 in the region of the Jordan in the valley in front of Beth-pe´or, in the land of Si´hon the king of the Am´or·ites, who was dwelling in Hesh´bon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated on their coming out of Egypt.
</br>47 And they went taking possession of his land and of the land of Og the king of Ba´shan, the two kings of the Am´or·ites who were in the region of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun,
</br>48 from A·ro´er, which is on the bank of the torrent valley of Ar´non, up to Mount Si´on, that is to say, Her´mon,
</br>49 and all the Ar´a·bah in the region of the Jordan toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Ar´a·bah at the base of the slopes of Pis´gah.

</br>14 Let me alone that I may annihilate them and wipe out their name from under the heavens, and let me make you a nation mightier and more populous than they are.’

</br>17 At that I took hold of the two tablets and flung them down from both my hands and shattered them before YOUR eyes.

</br>18 As for Jehovah, he has induced you to say today that you will become his people, a special property, just as he has promised you, and that you will observe all his commandments,
</br>19 and that he will put you high above all the other nations that he has made, resulting in praise and reputation and beauty, while you prove yourself a people holy to Jehovah your God, just as he has promised.”

</br>2 And it must occur that in the day when YOU will cross the Jordan into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must also set up for yourself great stones and whitewash them with lime.
</br>3 And you must write upon them all the words of this law when you have crossed, in order that you may enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, according to what Jehovah the God of your forefathers has spoken to you.

</br>5 You must also build an altar there to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones. You must not wield an iron tool upon them.
</br>6 With whole stones you should build the altar of Jehovah your God, and you must offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it.

</br>61 Also, any sickness and any plague that is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah will bring them upon you until you have been annihilated.

<p></p>
</br>63 “And it must occur that just as Jehovah exulted over YOU to do YOU good and to multiply YOU, so Jehovah will exult over YOU to destroy YOU and to annihilate YOU; and YOU will simply be torn away from off the soil to which you are going to take possession of it.
<p></p>
</br>64 “And Jehovah will certainly scatter you among all the peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, and there you will have to serve other gods whom you have not known, neither you nor your forefathers, wood and stone.
</br>65 And among those nations you will have no ease, nor will there prove to be any resting-place for the sole of your foot; and Jehovah will indeed give you there a trembling heart and a failing of the eyes and despair of soul.
</br>66 And you will certainly be in the greatest peril for your life and be in dread night and day, and you will not be sure of your life.
</br>67 In the morning you will say, ‘If it only were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If it only were morning!’ because of the dread of your heart with which you will be in dread and because of the sight of your eyes that you will see.
</br>68 And Jehovah will certainly bring you back to Egypt by ships by the way about which I have said to you, ‘You will never see it again,’ and YOU will have to sell yourselves there to your enemies as slave men and maidservants, but there will be no buyer.”

</br>1 These are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to conclude with the sons of Israel in the land of Mo´ab aside from the covenant that he had concluded with them in Ho´reb.
<p></p>
</br>2 And Moses proceeded to call all Israel and to say to them: “YOU were the ones seeing all that Jehovah did before YOUR eyes in the land of Egypt to Phar´aoh and all his servants and all his land,
</br>3 the great provings that your eyes saw, those great signs and miracles.
</br>4 And yet Jehovah has not given YOU a heart to know and eyes to see and ears to hear down to this day.
</br>5 ‘While I kept guiding YOU forty years in the wilderness, YOUR garments did not wear out upon YOU, and your sandal did not wear out upon your foot.
</br>6 Bread YOU did not eat, and wine and intoxicating liquor YOU did not drink, in order that YOU might know that I am Jehovah YOUR God.’
</br>7 Eventually YOU came to this place, and Si´hon the king of Hesh´bon and Og the king of Ba´shan proceeded to come out to meet us in battle, but we defeated them.
</br>8 After that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reu´ben·ites and the Gad´ites and half the tribe of the Ma·nas´sites.
</br>9 So YOU must keep the words of this covenant and do them, in order that YOU may make everything YOU will do turn out well.
<p></p>
</br>10 “YOU are all of YOU stationed today before Jehovah YOUR God, the heads of YOUR tribes, YOUR older men and YOUR officers, every man of Israel,
</br>11 YOUR little ones, YOUR wives, and your alien resident who is in the midst of your camp, from the gatherer of your wood to the drawer of your water,
</br>12 in order for you to enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God and his oath, which Jehovah your God is concluding with you today;
</br>13 for the purpose of establishing you today as his people and that he may prove himself your God, just as he has promised you and just as he has sworn to your forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
<p></p>
</br>14 “Now it is not with YOU alone that I am concluding this covenant and this oath,
</br>15 but it is with him who is here standing with us today before Jehovah our God and with those who are not here with us today;
</br>16 (for YOU yourselves well know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the midst of the nations through whom YOU passed.
</br>17 And YOU used to see their disgusting things and their dungy idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, that were with them;)
</br>18 that there may not be among YOU a man or a woman or a family or a tribe whose heart is turning today away from Jehovah our God to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there may not be among YOU a root bearing the fruit of a poisonous plant and wormwood.
<p></p>
</br>19 “And it must occur that when someone has heard the words of this oath, and he has blessed himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall come to have peace, although I shall walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ with the intention of sweeping away the well-watered one along with the thirsty ones,
</br>20 Jehovah will not want to forgive him, but then Jehovah’s anger and his ardor will smoke against that man, and all the oath written in this book will certainly settle down on him, and Jehovah will indeed wipe out his name from under the heavens.
</br>21 So Jehovah will have to separate him for calamity from all the tribes of Israel in accord with all the oath of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
<p></p>
</br>22 “And the future generation, YOUR sons who will rise up after YOU, will be bound to say, also the foreigner who will come from a distant land, even [when] they have seen the plagues of that land and its maladies with which Jehovah has sickened it,
</br>23 sulphur and salt and burning, so that its whole land will not be sown, nor sprout, nor will any vegetation spring up in it, like the overthrow of Sod´om and Go·mor´rah, Ad´mah and Ze·boi´im, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath;
</br>24 yes, all the nations will be bound to say, ‘Why did Jehovah do like this to this land? Why the heat of this great anger?’
</br>25 Then they will have to say, ‘It was because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah the God of their forefathers, which he concluded with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
</br>26 And they proceeded to go and serve other gods and to bow down to them, gods that they had not known and he had not apportioned to them.
</br>27 Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against that land by bringing upon it the whole malediction written in this book.
</br>28 Hence Jehovah uprooted them from off their soil in anger and rage and great indignation and threw them into another land as at this day.’

</br>2 and said to them: “A hundred and twenty years old I am today. I shall no more be allowed to go out and come in, as Jehovah has said to me, ‘You will not cross this Jordan.’
</br>3 Jehovah your God is the one crossing before you. He himself will annihilate these nations from before you, and you must drive them away. Joshua is the one crossing before you, just as Jehovah has spoken.
</br>4 And Jehovah will certainly do to them just as he has done to Si´hon and to Og, the kings of the Am´or·ites, and to their land, when he annihilated them.
</br>5 And Jehovah has abandoned them to YOU, and YOU must do to them according to all the commandment that I have commanded YOU.
</br>6 BE courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or suffer a shock before them, because Jehovah your God is the one marching with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely.”
<p></p>
</br>7 And Moses proceeded to call Joshua and say to him before the eyes of all Israel: “Be courageous and strong, because you—you will bring this people into the land that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them, and you yourself will give it to them as an inheritance.
</br>8 And Jehovah is the one marching before you. He himself will continue with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely. Do not be afraid or be terrified.”
<p></p>
</br>9 Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests the sons of Le´vi, the carriers of the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, and to all the older men of Israel.
</br>10 And Moses went on to command them, saying: “At the end of every seven years, in the appointed time of the year of the release, in the festival of booths,
</br>11 when all Israel comes to see the face of Jehovah your God in the place that he will choose, you will read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing.
</br>12 Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones and your alien resident who is within your gates, in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn, as they must fear Jehovah YOUR God and take care to carry out all the words of this law.
</br>13 And their sons who have not known should listen, and they must learn to fear Jehovah YOUR God all the days that YOU are living upon the soil to which YOU are crossing the Jordan to take possession of it.”
<p></p>
</br>14 After that Jehovah said to Moses: “Look! The days have drawn near for you to die. Call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and stationed themselves in the tent of meeting.
</br>15 Then Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud began to stand by the entrance of the tent.
<p></p>
</br>16 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Look! You are lying down with your forefathers; and this people will certainly get up and have immoral intercourse with foreign gods of the land to which they are going, in their very midst, and they will certainly forsake me and break my covenant that I have concluded with them.
</br>17 At that my anger will indeed blaze against them in that day, and I shall certainly forsake them and conceal my face from them, and they must become something to be consumed; and many calamities and distresses must come upon them, and they will be bound to say in that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not in our midst that these calamities have come upon us?’
</br>18 As for me, I shall absolutely conceal my face in that day because of all the badness that they have done, because they have turned to other gods.
<p></p>
</br>19 “And now WRITE for yourselves this song and teach it to the sons of Israel. Place it in their mouths in order that this song may serve as my witness against the sons of Israel.
</br>20 For I shall bring them to the ground that I have sworn about to their forefathers, which flows with milk and honey, and they will certainly eat and be satisfied and grow fat and turn to other gods, and they will indeed serve them and treat me with disrespect and break my covenant.
</br>21 And it must occur that when many calamities and distresses will come upon them, this song must also answer before them as a witness, because it should not be forgotten out of the mouth of their offspring, for I well know their inclination that they are developing today before I bring them into the land about which I have sworn.”
<p></p>
</br>22 So Moses wrote this song in that day, that he might teach it to the sons of Israel.
<p></p>
</br>23 And he proceeded to commission Joshua the son of Nun and to say: “Be courageous and strong, because you—you will bring the sons of Israel into the land about which I have sworn to them, and I myself shall continue with you.”
<p></p>
</br>24 And it came about that as soon as Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book until their completion,
</br>25 Moses began to command the Levites, the carriers of the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, saying:
</br>26 “Taking this book of the law, YOU must place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah YOUR God, and it must serve as a witness there against you.
</br>27 For I—I well know your rebelliousness and your stiff neck. If while I am yet alive with YOU today, YOU have proved rebellious in behavior toward Jehovah, then how much more so after my death!
</br>28 Congregate to me all the older men of YOUR tribes and YOUR officers, and let me speak in their hearing these words, and let me take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them.
</br>29 For I well know that after my death YOU will without fail act ruinously, and YOU will certainly turn aside from the way about which I have commanded YOU; and calamity will be bound to befall YOU at the close of the days, because YOU will do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah so as to offend him by the works of YOUR hands.”
<p></p>
</br>30 And Moses proceeded to speak in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until their completion:

</br>44 Thus Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Ho·she´a the son of Nun.
</br>45 After Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
</br>46 he went on to say to them: “Apply YOUR hearts to all the words that I am speaking in warning to YOU today, that YOU may command YOUR sons to take care to do all the words of this law.
</br>47 For it is no valueless word for YOU, but it means YOUR life, and by this word YOU may lengthen YOUR days upon the soil to which YOU are crossing the Jordan to take possession of it.”
<p></p>
</br>48 And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses on this same day, saying:
</br>49 “Go up into this mountain of Ab´a·rim, Mount Ne´bo, which is in the land of Mo´ab, which fronts toward Jer´i·cho, and see the land of Ca´naan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel as a possession.
</br>50 Then die on the mountain into which you are going up, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and got to be gathered to his people;
</br>51 for the reason that YOU men acted undutifully toward me in the middle of the sons of Israel at the waters of Mer´i·bah of Ka´desh in the wilderness of Zin; for the reason that YOU men did not sanctify me in the middle of the sons of Israel.

</br>2 and all Naph´ta·li and the land of E´phra·im and Ma·nas´seh and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
</br>3 and the Neg´eb and the District, the valley plain of Jer´i·cho, the city of the palm trees, as far as Zo´ar.

</br>4 And Jehovah went on to say to him: “This is the land about which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘To your seed I shall give it.’ I have caused you to see it with your own eyes, as you will not cross over there.”

</br>5 After that Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Mo´ab at the order of Jehovah.

</br>7 And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at his death. His eye had not grown dim, and his vital strength had not fled.
</br>8 And the sons of Israel proceeded to weep for Moses on the desert plains of Mo´ab thirty days. At length the days of weeping of the mourning period for Moses were completed.

</br>9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand upon him; and the sons of Israel began to listen to him and they went doing just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
</br>10 But there has never yet risen up a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
</br>11 as respects all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Phar´aoh and all his servants and all his land,
