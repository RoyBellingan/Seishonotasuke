</br>1 The proverbs of Sol´o·mon the son of David, the king of Israel,
</br>2 for one to know wisdom and discipline, to discern the sayings of understanding,
</br>3 to receive the discipline that gives insight, righteousness and judgment and uprightness,
</br>4 to give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness, to a young man knowledge and thinking ability.
<p></p>
</br>5 A wise person will listen and take in more instruction, and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction,
</br>6 to understand a proverb and a puzzling saying, the words of wise persons and their riddles.
<p></p>
</br>7 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge. Wisdom and discipline are what mere fools have despised.
<p></p>
</br>8 Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.
</br>9 For they are a wreath of attractiveness to your head and a fine necklace to your throat.
<p></p>
</br>10 My son, if sinners try to seduce you, do not consent.
</br>11 If they keep saying: “Do go with us. Do let us lie in ambush for blood. Do let us lie in concealment for the innocent men without any cause.
</br>12 Let us swallow them down alive just like She´ol, even whole, like those going down into a pit.
</br>13 Let us find all sorts of precious valuables. Let us fill our houses with spoil.
</br>14 Your lot you ought to cast in among us. Let there come to be just one bag belonging to all of us”—
</br>15 my son, do not go in the way with them. Hold back your foot from their roadway.
</br>16 For their feet are those that run to sheer badness, and they keep hastening to shed blood.
</br>17 For it is for nothing that the net is spread before the eyes of anything owning wings.
</br>18 Consequently they themselves lie in ambush for the very blood of these; they lie in concealment for their souls.
</br>19 Thus are the paths of everyone making unjust profit. It takes away the very soul of its owners.
<p></p>
</br>20 True wisdom itself keeps crying aloud in the very street. In the public squares it keeps giving forth its voice.
</br>21 At the upper end of the noisy streets it calls out. At the entrances of the gates into the city it says its own sayings:
<p></p>
</br>22 “How long will YOU inexperienced ones keep loving inexperience, and [how long] must YOU ridiculers desire for yourselves outright ridicule, and [how long] will YOU stupid ones keep hating knowledge?
</br>23 Turn back at my reproof. Then to YOU I will cause my spirit to bubble forth; I will make my words known to YOU.
</br>24 Because I have called out but YOU keep refusing, I have stretched out my hand but there is no one paying attention,
</br>25 and YOU keep neglecting all my counsel, and my reproof YOU have not accepted,
</br>26 I also, for my part, shall laugh at YOUR own disaster, I shall mock when what YOU dread comes,
</br>27 when what YOU dread comes just like a storm, and YOUR own disaster gets here just like a storm wind, when distress and hard times come upon YOU.
</br>28 At that time they will keep calling me, but I shall not answer; they will keep looking for me, but they will not find me,
</br>29 for the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah they did not choose.
</br>30 They did not consent to my counsel; they disrespected all my reproof.
</br>31 So they will eat from the fruitage of their way, and they will be glutted with their own counsels.
</br>32 For the renegading of the inexperienced ones is what will kill them, and the easygoingness of the stupid is what will destroy them.
</br>33 As for the one listening to me, he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity.”

<p></p>
</br>1 My son, if you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself,
</br>2 so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear, that you may incline your heart to discernment;
</br>3 if, moreover, you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself,
</br>4 if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it,
</br>5 in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.
</br>6 For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment.
</br>7 And for the upright ones he will treasure up practical wisdom; for those walking in integrity he is a shield,
</br>8 by observing the paths of judgment, and he will guard the very way of his loyal ones.
</br>9 In that case you will understand righteousness and judgment and uprightness, the entire course of what is good.
<p></p>
</br>10 When wisdom enters into your heart and knowledge itself becomes pleasant to your very soul,
</br>11 thinking ability itself will keep guard over you, discernment itself will safeguard you,
</br>12 to deliver you from the bad way, from the man speaking perverse things,
</br>13 from those leaving the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
</br>14 from those who are rejoicing in doing bad, who are joyful in the perverse things of badness;
</br>15 those whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their general course;
</br>16 to deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreign woman who has made her own sayings smooth,
</br>17 who is leaving the confidential friend of her youth and who has forgotten the very covenant of her God.
</br>18 For down to death her house does sink and down to those impotent in death her tracks.
</br>19 None of those having relations with her will come back, nor will they regain the paths of those living.
<p></p>
</br>20 The purpose is that you may walk in the way of good people and that the paths of the righteous ones you may keep.
</br>21 For the upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it.
</br>22 As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.

</br>1 My son, my law do not forget, and my commandments may your heart observe,
</br>2 because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you.
</br>3 May loving-kindness and trueness themselves not leave you. Tie them about your throat. Write them upon the tablet of your heart,
</br>4 and so find favor and good insight in the eyes of God and of earthling man.
</br>5 Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.
</br>6 In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.
<p></p>
</br>7 Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.
</br>8 May it become a healing to your navel and a refreshment to your bones.
<p></p>
</br>9 Honor Jehovah with your valuable things and with the firstfruits of all your produce.
</br>10 Then your stores of supply will be filled with plenty; and with new wine your own press vats will overflow.
<p></p>
</br>11 The discipline of Jehovah, O my son, do not reject; and do not abhor his reproof,
</br>12 because the one whom Jehovah loves he reproves, even as a father does a son in whom he finds pleasure.
<p></p>
</br>13 Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment,
</br>14 for having it as gain is better than having silver as gain and having it as produce than gold itself.
</br>15 It is more precious than corals, and all other delights of yours cannot be made equal to it.
</br>16 Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand there are riches and glory.
</br>17 Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its roadways are peace.
</br>18 It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.
<p></p>
</br>19 Jehovah himself in wisdom founded the earth. He solidly fixed the heavens in discernment.
</br>20 By his knowledge the watery deeps themselves were split apart, and the cloudy skies keep dripping down light rain.
</br>21 My son, may they not get away from your eyes. Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability,
</br>22 and they will prove to be life to your soul and charm to your throat.
</br>23 In that case you will walk in security on your way, and even your foot will not strike against anything.
</br>24 Whenever you lie down you will feel no dread; and you will certainly lie down, and your sleep must be pleasurable.
</br>25 You will not need to be afraid of any sudden dreadful thing, nor of the storm upon the wicked ones, because it is coming.
</br>26 For Jehovah himself will prove to be, in effect, your confidence, and he will certainly keep your foot against capture.
<p></p>
</br>27 Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do [it].
</br>28 Do not say to your fellowman: “Go, and come back and tomorrow I shall give,” when there is something with you.
</br>29 Do not fabricate against your fellowman anything bad, when he is dwelling in a sense of security with you.
</br>30 Do not quarrel with a man without cause, if he has rendered no bad to you.
<p></p>
</br>31 Do not become envious of the man of violence, nor choose any of his ways.
</br>32 For the devious person is a detestable thing to Jehovah, but His intimacy is with the upright ones.
</br>33 The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one, but the abiding place of the righteous ones he blesses.
</br>34 If it has to do with ridiculers, he himself will deride; but to the meek ones he will show favor.
</br>35 Honor is what the wise ones will come to possess, but the stupid ones are exalting dishonor.

</br>1 Listen, O sons, to the discipline of a father and pay attention, so as to know understanding.
</br>2 For good instruction is what I certainly shall give to YOU. My law DO not leave.
</br>3 For I proved to be a real son to my father, tender and the only one before my mother.
</br>4 And he would instruct me and say to me: “May your heart keep fast hold of my words. Keep my commandments and continue living.
</br>5 Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding. Do not forget, and do not turn aside from the sayings of my mouth.
</br>6 Do not leave it, and it will keep you. Love it, and it will safeguard you.
</br>7 Wisdom is the prime thing. Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.
</br>8 Highly esteem it, and it will exalt you. It will glorify you because you embrace it.
</br>9 To your head it will give a wreath of charm; a crown of beauty it will bestow upon you.”
<p></p>
</br>10 Hear, my son, and accept my sayings. Then for you the years of life will become many.
</br>11 I will instruct you even in the way of wisdom; I will cause you to tread in the tracks of uprightness.
</br>12 When you walk, your pace will not be cramped; and if you run, you will not stumble.
</br>13 Take hold on discipline; do not let go. Safeguard it, for it itself is your life.
<p></p>
</br>14 Into the path of the wicked ones do not enter, and do not walk straight on into the way of the bad ones.
</br>15 Shun it, do not pass along by it; turn aside from it, and pass along.
</br>16 For they do not sleep unless they do badness, and their sleep has been snatched away unless they cause someone to stumble.
</br>17 For they have fed themselves with the bread of wickedness, and the wine of acts of violence is what they drink.
</br>18 But the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.
</br>19 The way of the wicked ones is like the gloom; they have not known at what they keep stumbling.
<p></p>
</br>20 My son, to my words do pay attention. To my sayings incline your ear.
</br>21 May they not get away from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart.
</br>22 For they are life to those finding them and health to all their flesh.
</br>23 More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.
</br>24 Remove from yourself the crookedness of speech; and the deviousness of lips put far away from yourself.
</br>25 As for your eyes, straight ahead they should look, yes, your own beaming eyes should gaze straight in front of you.
</br>26 Smooth out the course of your foot, and may all your own ways be firmly established.

</br>2 so as to guard thinking abilities; and may your own lips safeguard knowledge itself.
<p></p>
</br>3 For as a honeycomb the lips of a strange woman keep dripping, and her palate is smoother than oil.
</br>4 But the aftereffect from her is as bitter as wormwood; it is as sharp as a two-edged sword.
</br>5 Her feet are descending to death. Her very steps take hold on She´ol itself.
</br>6 The path of life she does not contemplate. Her tracks have wandered she does not know [where].
</br>7 So now, O sons, listen to me and do not turn away from the sayings of my mouth.
</br>8 Keep your way far off from alongside her, and do not get near to the entrance of her house,
</br>9 that you may not give to others your dignity, nor your years to what is cruel;
</br>10 that strangers may not satisfy themselves with your power, nor the things you got by pain be in the house of a foreigner,
</br>11 nor you have to groan in your future when your flesh and your organism come to an end.
</br>12 And you will have to say: “How I have hated discipline and my heart has disrespected even reproof!
</br>13 And I have not listened to the voice of my instructors, and to my teachers I have not inclined my ear.
</br>14 Easily I have come to be in every sort of badness in the midst of the congregation and of the assembly.”

</br>17 Let them prove to be for you alone, and not for strangers with you.
</br>18 Let your water source prove to be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,
</br>19 a lovable hind and a charming mountain goat. Let her own breasts intoxicate you at all times. With her love may you be in an ecstasy constantly.
</br>20 So why should you, my son, be in an ecstasy with a strange woman or embrace the bosom of a foreign woman?
</br>21 For the ways of man are in front of the eyes of Jehovah, and he is contemplating all his tracks.
</br>22 His own errors will catch the wicked one, and in the ropes of his own sin he will be taken hold of.
</br>23 He will be the one to die because there is no discipline, and [because] in the abundance of his foolishness he goes astray.

</br>2 [if] you have been ensnared by the sayings of your mouth, [if] you have been caught by the sayings of your mouth,
</br>3 take this action then, my son, and deliver yourself, for you have come into the palm of your fellowman: Go humble yourself and storm your fellowman with importunities.

</br>6 Go to the ant, you lazy one; see its ways and become wise.
</br>7 Although it has no commander, officer or ruler,
</br>8 it prepares its food even in the summer; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest.
</br>9 How long, you lazy one, will you keep lying down? When will you rise up from your sleep?
</br>10 A little more sleep, a little more slumbering, a little more folding of the hands in lying down,
</br>11 and your poverty will certainly come just like some rover, and your want like an armed man.
<p></p>
</br>12 A good-for-nothing man, a man of hurtfulness, is walking with crookedness of speech,
</br>13 winking with his eye, making signs with his foot, making indications with his fingers.
</br>14 Perverseness is in his heart. He is fabricating something bad all the time. He keeps sending out merely contentions.
</br>15 That is why suddenly there will come his disaster; in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no healing.
<p></p>
</br>16 There are six things that Jehovah does hate; yes, seven are things detestable to his soul:
</br>17 lofty eyes, a false tongue, and hands that are shedding innocent blood,
</br>18 a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness,
</br>19 a false witness that launches forth lies, and anyone sending forth contentions among brothers.
<p></p>
</br>20 Observe, O my son, the commandment of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.
</br>21 Tie them upon your heart constantly; bind them upon your throat.
</br>22 When you walk about, it will lead you; when you lie down, it will stand guard over you; and when you have waked up, it itself will make you its concern.
</br>23 For the commandment is a lamp, and a light the law is, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
</br>24 to guard you against the bad woman, against the smoothness of the tongue of the foreign woman.
</br>25 Do not desire her prettiness in your heart, and may she not take you with her lustrous eyes,
</br>26 because in behalf of a woman prostitute [one comes down] to a round loaf of bread; but as regards another man’s wife, she hunts even for a precious soul.
</br>27 Can a man rake together fire into his bosom and yet his very garments not be burned?
</br>28 Or can a man walk upon the coals and his feet themselves not be scorched?
</br>29 Likewise with anyone having relations with the wife of his fellowman, no one touching her will remain unpunishable.
</br>30 People do not despise a thief just because he commits thievery to fill his soul when he is hungry.
</br>31 But, when found, he will make it good with seven times as much; all the valuables of his house he will give.
</br>32 Anyone committing adultery with a woman is in want of heart; he that does it is bringing his own soul to ruin.
</br>33 A plague and dishonor he will find, and his reproach itself will not be wiped out.
</br>34 For the rage of an able-bodied man is jealousy, and he will not show compassion in the day of vengeance.

</br>11 She is boisterous and stubborn. In her house her feet do not keep residing.
</br>12 Now she is outdoors, now she is in the public squares, and near every corner she lies in wait.

</br>20 A bag of money he has taken in his hand. On the day of the full moon he will come to his house.”

</br>23 until an arrow cleaves open his liver, just as a bird hastens into the trap, and he has not known that it involves his very soul.

</br>21 Anyone becoming father to a stupid child—it is a grief to him; and the father of a senseless child does not rejoice.

</br>22 A heart that is joyful does good as a curer, but a spirit that is stricken makes the bones dry.

</br>23 One who is wicked will take even a bribe from the bosom to bend the paths of judgment.

</br>24 Wisdom is before the face of the understanding one, but the eyes of the stupid one are at the extremity of the earth.

</br>27 Anyone holding back his sayings is possessed of knowledge, and a man of discernment is cool of spirit.

<p></p>
</br>2 The glory of God is the keeping of a matter secret, and the glory of kings is the searching through a matter.
<p></p>
</br>3 The heavens for height and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings, that is unsearchable.

</br>4 Let there be a removing of scummy dross from the silver, and all of it will come forth refined.
<p></p>
</br>5 Let there be the removing of the wicked one before the king, and his throne will be firmly established by righteousness itself.
<p></p>
</br>6 Do not do yourself honor before the king, and in the place of great ones do not stand.
</br>7 For it is better [for him] to say to you: “Come up here,” than to abase you before a noble whom your eyes have seen.
<p></p>
</br>8 Do not go forth to conduct a legal case hastily, that it may not be a question of what you will do in the culmination of it when your fellowman now humiliates you.
</br>9 Plead your own cause with your fellowman, and do not reveal the confidential talk of another;
</br>10 that the one listening may not put you to shame and the bad report by you can have no recall.

</br>11 As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it.
<p></p>
</br>12 An earring of gold, and an ornament of special gold, is a wise reprover upon the hearing ear.
<p></p>
</br>13 Just like the coolness of snow in the day of harvest is the faithful envoy to those sending him, for he restores the very soul of his masters.
<p></p>
</br>14 As vaporous clouds and a wind without any downpour is a man boasting himself about a gift in falsehood.

</br>17 Make your foot rare at the house of your fellowman, that he may not have his sufficiency of you and certainly hate you.
<p></p>
</br>18 As a war club and a sword and a sharpened arrow is a man testifying against his fellowman as a false witness.
<p></p>
</br>19 As a broken tooth and a wobbling foot is the confidence in one proving treacherous in the day of distress.

</br>20 He that is removing a garment on a cold day is as vinegar upon alkali and as a singer with songs upon a gloomy heart.
