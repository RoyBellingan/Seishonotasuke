</br>2 And he proceeded to say:
<p></p>
“Jehovah—out of Zion he will roar, and out of Jerusalem he will give forth his voice; and the pasture grounds of the shepherds must go to mourning, and the summit of Car´mel must dry up.”

</br>8 And I will cut off [the] inhabitant from Ash´dod, and the holder of [the] scepter from Ash´ke·lon; and I will turn my hand back upon Ek´ron, and the remaining ones of the Phi·lis´tines must perish,” the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said.’
<p></p>
</br>9 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘On account of three revolts of Tyre, and on account of four, I shall not turn it back, on account of their handing over a complete body of exiles to E´dom, and [because] they did not remember the covenant of brothers.
</br>10 And I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre, and it must devour her dwelling towers.’

</br>11 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘On account of three revolts of E´dom, and on account of four, I shall not turn it back, on account of his pursuing his own brother with the sword, and [because] he ruined his [own] merciful qualities, and his anger keeps tearing away forever; and his fury—he has kept it perpetually.
</br>12 And I will send a fire into Te´man, and it must devour the dwelling towers of Boz´rah.’

</br>13 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘“On account of three revolts of the sons of Am´mon, and on account of four, I shall not turn it back, on account of their slitting open the pregnant women of Gil´e·ad, for the purpose of widening out their own territory.
