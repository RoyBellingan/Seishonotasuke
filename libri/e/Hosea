       <span id="vs1">The word of Jehovah that occurred to Ho&middot;se&acute;a the son of Be&middot;e&acute;ri in the days of Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah, Jo&acute;tham, A&acute;haz [and] Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Jo&acute;ash, the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">There was a start of the word of Jehovah by Ho&middot;se&acute;a, and Jehovah proceeded to say to Ho&middot;se&acute;a: “Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication and children of fornication, because by fornication the land positively turns from following Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jehovah went on to say to him: “Call his name Jez&acute;re&middot;el, for yet a little while and I must hold an accounting for the acts of bloodshed of Jez&acute;re&middot;el against the house of Je&acute;hu, and I must cause the royal rule of the house of Israel to cease.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it must occur in that day that I must break the bow of Israel in the low plain of Jez&acute;re&middot;el.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And she proceeded to become pregnant another time and to give birth to a daughter. And He went on to say to him: “Call her name Lo-ru&middot;ha&acute;mah, for I shall no more show mercy again to the house of Israel, because I shall positively take them away.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But to the house of Judah I shall show mercy, and I will save them by Jehovah their God; but I shall not save them by a bow or by a sword or by war, by horses or by horsemen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And she gradually weaned Lo-ru&middot;ha&acute;mah, and she proceeded to become pregnant and give birth to a son.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So He said: “Call his name Lo-am&acute;mi, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are not my people and I myself shall prove to be not <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“And the number of the sons of Israel must become like the grains of the sand of the sea that cannot be measured or numbered. And it must occur that in the place in which it used to be said to them, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men are not my people,’ it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will certainly be collected together into a unity and will actually set up for themselves one head and go up out of the land, because great will be the day of Jez&acute;re&middot;el.</span>

       <span id="vs2">There are the pronouncing of curses and practicing of deception and murdering and stealing and committing of adultery that have broken forth, and acts of bloodshed have touched other acts of bloodshed.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">That is why the land will mourn and every inhabitant in it will have to fade away with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens, and even the fishes of the sea themselves will be gathered [in death].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“However, let no man contend, neither let a man reprove, as your people are like those who are contending against a priest.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And you will certainly stumble in the daytime, and even a prophet must stumble with you, as at night. And I will put your mother to silence.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">My people will certainly be silenced, because there is no knowledge. Because the knowledge is what you yourself have rejected, I shall also reject you from serving as a priest to me; and [because] you keep forgetting the law of your God, I shall forget your sons, even I.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">In proportion to the multitude of them, so they have sinned against me. My own glory they have exchanged for mere dishonor.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The sin of my people is what they keep devouring, and to their error they keep lifting up their soul.</span>

       <span id="vs10">And they will actually eat, but will not get satisfied. They will actually treat [women] as harlots; but they will not increase, because they have left off paying regard to Jehovah himself.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Fornication and wine and sweet wine are what take away good motive.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Of their wooden [idol] my own people keep inquiring, and their own [hand] staff keeps telling them; because the very spirit of fornication has caused them to wander off, and by fornication they go out from under their God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, and on the hills they make sacrificial smoke, under massive tree and storax tree and big tree, because its shade is good. That is why <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters commit fornication and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own daughters-in-law commit adultery.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“I shall not hold an accounting against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters because they commit fornication, and against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters-in-law because they commit adultery. For, as to the [men], it is with the harlots that they get off to themselves, and with the female temple prostitutes that they sacrifice; and a people [that] does not understand will be trodden down.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Although you are committing fornication, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty, and do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people come to Gil&acute;gal, neither go up to Beth-a&acute;ven nor swear ‘As Jehovah is alive!’</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For, like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn. Is it now that Jehovah will shepherd them like a young ram in a roomy place?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">E&acute;phra&middot;im is joined with idols. Let him be to himself!</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Their wheat beer being gone, they have positively treated [woman] as a harlot. Her shielders have positively loved dishonor.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs2">And they do not say to their own heart that all their badness I will remember. Now their dealings have surrounded them. In front of my face they have come to be.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">By their badness they make [the] king rejoice, and, by their deceptions, princes.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs5">On the day of our king, princes have sickened themselves—there is a rage because of wine. He has drawn his hand along with deriders.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For they have brought their heart near as to a furnace; it is burning inside them. All night long their baker is sleeping; by morning [the furnace] is burning as with a flaming fire.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They get hot, all of them, like the furnace, and they actually devour their judges. Their own kings have all fallen; none among them is calling out to me.</span>

       <span id="vs14">And they did not call to me for aid with their heart, although they kept howling on their beds. On account of their grain and sweet wine they kept loafing about; they kept turning against me.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I, for my part, did disciplining; I strengthened their arms, but against me they kept scheming what was bad.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And they proceeded to return, not to anything higher; they had become like a loose bow. By the sword their princes will fall because of the denunciation of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">Their heart has become hypocritical; now they will be found guilty.</span>
