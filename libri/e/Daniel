<p class="title">Daniel 1:1-21</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="12">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="21">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the third year of the kingship of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and proceeded to lay siege to it.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">In time Jehovah gave into his hand Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah and a part of the utensils of the house of the [true] God, so that he brought them to the land of Shi&acute;nar to the house of his god; and the utensils he brought to the treasure-house of his god.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then the king said to Ash&acute;pe&middot;naz his chief court official to bring some of the sons of Israel and of the royal offspring and of the nobles,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">children in whom there was no defect at all, but good in appearance and having insight into all wisdom and being acquainted with knowledge, and having discernment of what is known, in whom also there was ability to stand in the palace of the king; and to teach them the writing and the tongue of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Furthermore, to them the king appointed a daily allowance from the delicacies of the king and from his drinking wine, even to nourish them for three years, that at the end of these they might stand before the king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Now there happened to be among them some of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, Mish&acute;a&middot;el and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And to them the principal court official went assigning names. So he assigned to Daniel [the name of] Bel&middot;te&middot;shaz&acute;zar; and to Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, Sha&acute;drach; and to Mish&acute;a&middot;el, Me&acute;shach; and to Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah, A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But Daniel determined in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the delicacies of the king and with his drinking wine. And he kept requesting of the principal court official that he might not pollute himself.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Accordingly the [true] God gave Daniel over to loving-kindness and to mercy before the principal court official.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So the principal court official said to Daniel: “I am in fear of my lord the king, who has appointed <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> food and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> drink. Why, then, should he see <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faces dejected-looking in comparison with the children who are of the same age as <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>, and [why] should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have to make my head guilty to the king?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over Daniel, Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, Mish&acute;a&middot;el and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Please, put your servants to the test for ten days, and let them give us some vegetables that we may eat and water that we may drink;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and let our countenances and the countenance of the children who are eating the delicacies of the king appear before you, and according to what you see do with your servants.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Finally he listened to them as regards this matter and put them to the test for ten days.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the children who were eating the delicacies of the king.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So the guardian kept on taking away their delicacies and their drinking wine and giving them vegetables.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And as for these children, the four of them, to them the [true] God gave knowledge and insight in all writing and wisdom; and Daniel himself had understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in, the principal court official also proceeded to bring them in before Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the king began to speak with them, and out of them all no one was found like Daniel, Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, Mish&acute;a&middot;el and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah; and they continued to stand before the king.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And as regards every matter of wisdom [and] understanding that the king inquired about from them, he even got to find them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests [and] the conjurers that were in all his royal realm.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Daniel continued on until the first year of Cyrus the king.</span>

<p class="title">Daniel 2:1-49</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="12">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="49">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And in the second year of the kingship of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar dreamed dreams; and his spirit began to feel agitated, and his very sleep was made to be something beyond him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So the king said to call the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers and the sorcerers and the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans to tell the king his dreams. And they proceeded to come in and to stand before the king.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then the king said to them: “There is a dream that I have dreamed, and my spirit is agitated to know the dream.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At that the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans spoke to the king in the Ar&middot;a&middot;ma&acute;ic language: “O king, live on even for times indefinite. Say what the dream is to your servants, and we shall show the very interpretation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The king was answering and saying to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans: “The word is being promulgated by me: If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men do not make the dream known to me, and its interpretation, dismembered is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be, and into public privies <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own houses will be turned.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But if the dream and its interpretation <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will show, gifts and a present and much dignity <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will receive on my part. Therefore show me the very dream and its interpretation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They answered a second time and were saying: “Let the king say what the dream is to his servants, and we shall show its very interpretation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The king was answering and saying: “For a fact, I am aware that time is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are trying to gain, forasmuch as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have perceived that the word is being promulgated by me.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not make known to me the very dream, this one and only sentence is upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. But it is a lying and wrong word that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have agreed to say before me, until the time itself is changed. Therefore tell me the very dream, and I shall know that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can show the very interpretation of it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The Chal&middot;de&acute;ans answered before the king, and they were saying: “There does not exist a man on the dry land that is able to show the matter of the king, forasmuch as no grand king or governor has asked such a thing as this of any magic-practicing priest or conjurer or Chal&middot;de&acute;an.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But the thing that the king himself is asking is difficult, and nobody else exists who can show it before the king except the gods, whose own dwelling does not exist with flesh at all.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Because of this the king himself became angry and got very furious, and he said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the order itself went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they looked for Daniel and his companions, for them to be killed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At that time Daniel, for his part, addressed himself with counsel and sensibleness to Ar&acute;i&middot;och the chief of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">He was answering and saying to Ar&acute;i&middot;och the officer of the king: “For what reason is there such a harsh order on the part of the king?” Then it was that Ar&acute;i&middot;och made known the matter itself to Daniel.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So Daniel himself went in and asked from the king that he should give him time expressly to show the very interpretation to the king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">After that Daniel went to his own house; and to Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, Mish&acute;a&middot;el and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah his companions he made known the matter,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">even [for them] to ask for mercies on the part of the God of heaven concerning this secret, in order that they might not destroy Daniel and his companions with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then it was that to Daniel in a night vision the secret was revealed. Consequently Daniel himself blessed the God of heaven.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Daniel was answering and saying: “Let the name of God become blessed from time indefinite even to time indefinite, for wisdom and mightiness—for they belong to him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he is changing times and seasons, removing kings and setting up kings, giving wisdom to the wise ones and knowledge to those knowing discernment.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">He is revealing the deep things and the concealed things, knowing what is in the darkness; and with him the light does dwell.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">To you, O God of my forefathers, I am giving praise and commendation, because wisdom and mightiness you have given to me. And now you have made known to me what we requested of you, for you have made known to us the very matter of the king.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Because of this Daniel himself went in to Ar&acute;i&middot;och, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went, and this is what he said to him: “Do not destroy any wise men of Babylon. Take me in before the king, that I may show the interpretation itself to the king.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then it was that Ar&acute;i&middot;och, in a hurry, took Daniel in before the king, and this is what he said to him: “I have found an able-bodied man of the exiles of Judah who can make known the interpretation itself to the king.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">The king was answering and saying to Daniel, whose name was Bel&middot;te&middot;shaz&acute;zar: “Are you competent enough to make known to me the dream that I beheld, and its interpretation?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Daniel was answering before the king and saying: “The secret that the king himself is asking, the wise men, the conjurers, the magic-practicing priests [and] the astrologers themselves are unable to show to the king.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">However, there exists a God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets, and he has made known to King Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar what is to occur in the final part of the days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed—this it is:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“As for you, O king, on your bed your own thoughts came up as regards what is to occur after this, and the One who is the Revealer of secrets has made known to you what is to occur.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And as for me, it is not through any wisdom that exists in me more than in any others alive that this secret is revealed to me, except to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king himself and that the thoughts of your heart you may know.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“You, O king, happened to be beholding, and, look! a certain immense image. That image, which was large and the brightness of which was extraordinary, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was dreadful.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">As regards that image, its head was of good gold, its breasts and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs were of copper,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">its legs were of iron, its feet were partly of iron and partly of molded clay.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">You kept on looking until a stone was cut out not by hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and of molded clay and crushed them.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">At that time the iron, the molded clay, the copper, the silver and the gold were, all together, crushed and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away so that no trace at all was found of them. And as for the stone that struck the image, it became a large mountain and filled the whole earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“This is the dream, and its interpretation we shall say before the king.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">You, O king, the king of kings, you to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the might, and the strength and the dignity,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and into whose hand he has given, wherever the sons of mankind are dwelling, the beasts of the field and the winged creatures of the heavens, and whom he has made ruler over all of them, you yourself are the head of gold.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">“And after you there will rise another kingdom inferior to you; and another kingdom, a third one, of copper, that will rule over the whole earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“And as for the fourth kingdom, it will prove to be strong like iron. Forasmuch as iron is crushing and grinding everything else, so, like iron that shatters, it will crush and shatter even all these.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“And whereas you beheld the feet and the toes to be partly of molded clay of a potter and partly of iron, the kingdom itself will prove to be divided, but somewhat of the hardness of iron will prove to be in it, forasmuch as you beheld the iron mixed with moist clay.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And as for the toes of the feet being partly of iron and partly of molded clay, the kingdom will partly prove to be strong and will partly prove to be fragile.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Whereas you beheld iron mixed with moist clay, they will come to be mixed with the offspring of mankind; but they will not prove to be sticking together, this one to that one, just as iron is not mixing with molded clay.</span>

       <span id="vs44">“And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite;</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">forasmuch as you beheld that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, and [that] it crushed the iron, the copper, the molded clay, the silver and the gold. The grand God himself has made known to the king what is to occur after this. And the dream is reliable, and the interpretation of it is trustworthy.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">At that time King Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar himself fell down upon his face, and to Daniel he paid homage, and he said to offer even a present and incense to him.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">The king was answering Daniel and saying: “Truly the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a Revealer of secrets, because you were able to reveal this secret.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Consequently the king made Daniel someone great, and many big gifts he gave to him, and he made him the ruler over all the jurisdictional district of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And Daniel, for his part, made a request of the king, and he appointed over the administration of the jurisdictional district of Babylon Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, but Daniel was in the court of the king.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits [and] the breadth of which was six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Du&acute;ra in the jurisdictional district of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar himself as king sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the police magistrates and all the administrators of the jurisdictional districts to come to the inauguration of the image that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king had set up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At that time the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the police magistrates and all the administrators of the jurisdictional districts were assembling themselves for the inauguration of the image that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king had set up, and they were standing in front of the image that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar had set up.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the herald was crying out loudly: “To <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> it is being said, O peoples, national groups and languages,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">that at the time that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fall down and worship the image of gold that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king has set up.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And whoever does not fall down and worship will at the same moment be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Because of this, at the same time as all the peoples were hearing the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument and all sorts of musical instruments, all the peoples, national groups and languages were falling down [and] worshiping the image of gold that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king had set up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Because of this, at that same time certain Chal&middot;de&acute;ans approached and accused the Jews.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">They answered, and they were saying to Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king: “O king, live on even for times indefinite.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">You yourself, O king, set forth the command that every man that hears the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, and the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, should fall down and worship the image of gold;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">There exist certain Jews whom you appointed over the administration of the jurisdictional district of Babylon, Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go; these able-bodied men have paid no regard to you, O king, they are not serving your own gods, and the image of gold that you have set up they are not worshiping.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At that time Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, in a rage and fury, said to bring in Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go. Consequently these able-bodied men were brought in before the king.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar was answering and saying to them: “Is it really so, O Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not serving my own gods, and the image of gold that I have set up <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not worshiping?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are ready so that when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, and the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fall down and worship the image that I have made, [all right]. But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not worship, at that same moment <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is that god that can rescue <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of my hands?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go answered, and they were saying to the king: “O Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, we are under no necessity in this regard to say back a word to you.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If it is to be, our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand, O king, he will rescue [us].</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But if not, let it become known to you, O king, that your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then it was that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar himself got filled with fury, and the very expression of his face was changed toward Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go. He was answering and saying to heat up the furnace seven times more than it was customary to heat it up.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And to certain able-bodied men of vital energy who were in his military force he said to bind Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, in order to throw [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then it was that these able-bodied men were bound in their mantles, their garments and their caps and their other clothing and were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Just because the king’s word was harsh and the furnace was heated to excess, these able-bodied men that took up Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go were the ones that the fiery flame killed.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But these [other] able-bodied men, the three of them, Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, fell down bound in the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At that time Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king himself became frightened and he rose up in a hurry. He was answering and saying to his high royal officials: “Was it not three able-bodied men that we threw bound into the midst of the fire?” They were answering and saying to the king: “Yes, O king.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He was answering and saying: “Look! I am beholding four able-bodied men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt to them, and the appearance of the fourth one is resembling a son of the gods.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then it was that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace. He was answering and saying: “Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> servants of the Most High God, step out and come here!” At that time Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go were stepping out from the midst of the fire.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the satraps, the prefects and the governors and the high officials of the king that were assembled were beholding these able-bodied men, that the fire had had no power over their bodies, and not a hair of their head had been singed, and even their mantles had not been changed and the smell of fire itself had not come onto them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar was answering and saying: “Blessed be the God of Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go, who sent his angel and rescued his servants that trusted in him and that changed the very word of the king and gave over their bodies, because they would not serve and would not worship any god at all except their own God.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And from me an order is being put through, that any people, national group or language that says anything wrong against the God of Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go should be dismembered, and its house should be turned into a public privy; forasmuch as there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">At that time the king himself caused Sha&acute;drach, Me&acute;shach and A&middot;bed&acute;ne&middot;go to prosper in the jurisdictional district of Babylon.</span>

       <span id="vs22">it is you, O king, because you have grown great and become strong, and your grandeur has grown great and reached to the heavens, and your rulership to the extremity of the earth.</span>

       <span id="vs27">Therefore, O king, may my counsel seem good to you, and remove your own sins by righteousness, and your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor ones. Maybe there will occur a lengthening of your prosperity.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">All this befell Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king.</span>

       <span id="vs29">At the end of twelve lunar months he happened to be walking upon the royal palace of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">The king was answering and saying: “Is not this Babylon the Great, that I myself have built for the royal house with the strength of my might and for the dignity of my majesty?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, there was a voice that fell from the heavens: “To you it is being said, O Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar the king, ‘The kingdom itself has gone away from you,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">and from mankind they are driving even you away, and with the beasts of the field your dwelling will be.

</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">At that moment the word itself was fulfilled upon Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, and from mankind he was being driven away, and vegetation he began to eat just like bulls, and with the dew of the heavens his own body got to be wet, until his very hair grew long just like eagles’ [feathers] and his nails like birds’ [claws].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“And at the end of the days I, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, lifted up to the heavens my eyes, and my own understanding began to return to me; and I blessed the Most High himself, and the One living to time indefinite I praised and glorified, because his rulership is a rulership to time indefinite and his kingdom is for generation after generation.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And all the inhabitants of the earth are being considered as merely nothing, and he is doing according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth.

</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“At the same time my understanding itself began to return to me, and for the dignity of my kingdom my majesty and my brightness themselves began to return to me; and for me even my high royal officers and my grandees began eagerly searching, and I was reestablished upon my own kingdom, and greatness extraordinary was added to me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“Now I, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar, am praising and exalting and glorifying the King of the heavens, because all his works are truth and his ways are justice, and because those who are walking in pride he is able to humiliate.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">As regards Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar the king, he made a big feast for a thousand of his grandees, and in front of the thousand he was drinking wine.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar, under the influence of the wine, said to bring in the vessels of gold and of silver that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar his father had taken away from the temple that was in Jerusalem, that from them the king and his grandees, his concubines and his secondary wives might drink.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At that time they brought in the vessels of gold that they had taken away from the temple of the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and from them the king and his grandees, his concubines and his secondary wives drank.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">They drank wine, and they praised the gods of gold and of silver, copper, iron, wood and stone.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At that moment the fingers of a man’s hand came forth and were writing in front of the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was beholding the back of the hand that was writing.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that time, as regards the king, his very complexion was changed in him, and his own thoughts began to frighten him, and his hip joints were loosening and his very knees were knocking each other.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The king was calling out loudly to bring in the conjurers, the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans and the astrologers. The king was answering and saying to the wise men of Babylon: “Any man that will read this writing and show me its very interpretation, with purple he will be clothed, with a necklace of gold about his neck, and as the third one in the kingdom he will rule.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that time all the wise men of the king were coming in, but they were not competent enough to read the writing itself or to make known to the king the interpretation.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Consequently King Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar was very much frightened and his complexion was changing within him; and his grandees were perplexed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">As regards the queen, because of the words of the king and his grandees she entered right into the banqueting hall. The queen answered and said: “O king, keep living even to times indefinite. Do not let your thoughts frighten you, nor let your complexion be changed.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">There exists a capable man in your kingdom in whom there is the spirit of holy gods; and in the days of your father illumination and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of gods were found in him, and King Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar your father himself set him up as chief of the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans [and] the astrologers, [even] your father, O king;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">forasmuch as an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams and the explanation of riddles and the untying of knots had been found in him, in Daniel, whom the king himself named Bel&middot;te&middot;shaz&acute;zar. Now let Daniel himself be called, that he may show the very interpretation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Accordingly Daniel himself was brought in before the king. The king was speaking up and saying to Daniel: “Are you the Daniel that is of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I have also heard concerning you that the spirit of gods is in you, and illumination and insight and wisdom extraordinary have been found in you.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And now there have been brought in before me the wise men [and] the conjurers, that they may read this very writing, even to make known to me its interpretation; but they are not competent enough to show the very interpretation of the word.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I myself have heard concerning you, that you are able to furnish interpretations and to untie knots themselves. Now, if you are able to read the writing and to make known to me its very interpretation, with purple you will be clothed, with a necklace of gold around your neck, and as the third one in the kingdom you will rule.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At that time Daniel was answering and saying before the king: “Let your gifts prove to be to you yourself, and your presents do you give to others. However, I shall read the writing itself to the king, and the interpretation I shall make known to him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">As for you, O king, the Most High God himself gave to Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar your father the kingdom and the greatness and the dignity and the majesty.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And because of the greatness that He gave him, all peoples, national groups and languages proved to be quaking and showing fear before him. Whom he happened to want to, he was killing; and whom he happened to want to, he was striking; and whom he happened to want to, he was exalting; and whom he happened to want to, he was humiliating.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But when his heart became haughty and his own spirit became hard, so as to act presumptuously, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and his own dignity was taken away from him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And from the sons of mankind he was driven away, and his very heart was made like that of a beast, and with the wild asses his dwelling was. Vegetation they would give him to eat just like bulls, and with the dew of the heavens his own body got to be wet, until he knew that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that the one whom he wants to, he sets up over it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“And as for you, his son Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar, you have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But against the Lord of the heavens you exalted yourself, and they brought before you even the vessels of his house; and you yourself and your grandees, your concubines and your secondary wives have been drinking wine from them, and you have praised mere gods of silver and of gold, copper, iron, wood and stone, that are beholding nothing or hearing nothing or knowing nothing; but the God in whose hand your breath is and to whom all your ways belong you have not glorified.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Consequently from before him there was being sent the back of a hand, and this very writing was inscribed.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And this is the writing that was inscribed: ME&acute;NE, ME&acute;NE, TE&acute;KEL and PAR&acute;SIN.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“This is the interpretation of the word: ME&acute;NE, God has numbered [the days of] your kingdom and has finished it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“TE&acute;KEL, you have been weighed in the balances and have been found deficient.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“PE&acute;RES, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">At that time Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, with a necklace of gold about his neck; and they heralded concerning him that he was to become the third ruler in the kingdom.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In that very night Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar the Chal&middot;de&acute;an king was killed</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">and Da&middot;ri&acute;us the Mede himself received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.</span>

       <span id="vs1">It seemed good to Da&middot;ri&acute;us, and he set up over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, who were to be over the whole kingdom;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, in order that these satraps might continually be giving to them the report and the king himself might not become the loser.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then it was that this Daniel was steadily distinguishing himself over the high officials and the satraps, forasmuch as an extraordinary spirit was in him; and the king was intending to elevate him over all the kingdom.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At that time the high officials and the satraps themselves were constantly seeking to find some pretext against Daniel respecting the kingdom; but there was no pretext or corrupt thing at all that they were able to find, forasmuch as he was trustworthy and no negligence or corrupt thing at all was found in him.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Consequently these able-bodied men were saying: “We shall find in this Daniel no pretext at all, except we have to find [it] against him in the law of his God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly these high officials and satraps themselves entered as a throng to the king, and this is what they were saying to him: “O Da&middot;ri&acute;us the king, live on even for times indefinite.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high royal officers and the governors, have taken counsel together to establish a royal statute and to enforce an interdict, that whoever makes a petition to any god or man for thirty days except to you, O king, should be thrown to the lions’ pit.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now, O king, may you establish the statute and sign the writing, in order for [it] not to be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which is not annulled.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In accord with this, King Da&middot;ri&acute;us himself signed the writing and the interdict.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But Daniel, as soon as he knew that the writing had been signed, entered into his house, and, the windows in his roof chamber being open for him toward Jerusalem, even three times in a day he was kneeling on his knees and praying and offering praise before his God, as he had been regularly doing prior to this.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At that time these able-bodied men themselves crowded in and found Daniel petitioning and imploring favor before his God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then it was that they approached and were saying before the king concerning the interdict of the king: “Is there not an interdict that you have signed that any man that asks a petition from any god or man for thirty days except from you, O king, he should be thrown to the lions’ pit?” The king was answering and saying: “The matter is well established according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which is not annulled.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Immediately they answered, and they were saying before the king: “Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judah, has paid no regard to you, O king, nor to the interdict that you signed, but three times in a day he is making his petition.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Consequently the king, as soon as he heard the word, it was very displeasing to him, and toward Daniel he set [his] mind in order to rescue him; and till the setting of the sun he kept on striving to deliver him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Finally these able-bodied men themselves entered as a throng to the king, and they were saying to the king: “Take note, O king, that the law belonging to the Medes and the Persians is that any interdict or statute that the king himself establishes is not to be changed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly the king himself commanded, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the pit of the lions. The king was answering and saying to Daniel: “Your God whom you are serving with constancy, he himself will rescue you.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And a stone was brought and placed on the mouth of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet ring of his grandees, in order that nothing should be changed in the case of Daniel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that time the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no musical instruments were brought in before him, and his very sleep fled from him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Finally the king himself, at dawn, proceeded to get up in the daylight, and in a hurry he went right to the lions’ pit.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And as he got near to the pit, he cried out with a sad voice even to Daniel. The king was speaking up and saying to Daniel: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are serving with constancy been able to rescue you from the lions?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Immediately Daniel himself spoke even with the king: “O king, live on even to times indefinite.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">My own God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not brought me to ruin, forasmuch as before him innocence itself was found in me; and also before you, O king, no hurtful act have I done.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then it was that the king himself became very glad, and Daniel himself he commanded to be lifted up out of the pit. And Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, and there was no hurt at all found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the king commanded, and they brought these able-bodied men who had accused Daniel, and into the lions’ pit they threw them, their sons and their wives; and they had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions had got the mastery over them, and all their bones they crushed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then it was that Da&middot;ri&acute;us the king himself wrote to all the peoples, the national groups and the tongues that are dwelling in all the earth: “May <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> peace grow very much!</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">From before me there has been put through an order that, in every dominion of my kingdom, people are to be quaking and fearing before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God and One enduring to times indefinite, and his kingdom is one that will not be brought to ruin, and his dominion is forever.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He is rescuing and delivering and performing signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for he has rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And as for this Daniel, he prospered in the kingdom of Da&middot;ri&acute;us and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="28">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the first year of Bel&middot;shaz&acute;zar the king of Babylon, Daniel himself beheld a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. At that time he wrote down the dream itself. The complete account of the matters he told.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Daniel was speaking up and saying:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">“I happened to be beholding in my visions during the night, and, see there! the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And four huge beasts were coming up out of the sea, each one being different from the others.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I kept on beholding until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet just like a man, and there was given to it the heart of a man.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“And, see there! another beast, a second one, it being like a bear. And on one side it was raised up, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and this is what they were saying to it, ‘Get up, eat much flesh.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“After this I kept on beholding, and, see there! another [beast], one like a leopard, but it had four wings of a flying creature on its back. And the beast had four heads, and there was given to it rulership indeed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“After this I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! a fourth beast, fearsome and terrible and unusually strong. And it had teeth of iron, big ones. It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it was treading down with its feet. And it was something different from all the [other] beasts that were prior to it, and it had ten horns.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">I kept on considering the horns, and, look! another horn, a small one, came up in among them, and there were three of the first horns that were plucked up from before it. And, look! there were eyes like the eyes of a man in this horn, and there was a mouth speaking grandiose things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“I kept on beholding until there were thrones placed and the Ancient of Days sat down. His clothing was white just like snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool. His throne was flames of fire; its wheels were a burning fire.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">There was a stream of fire flowing and going out from before him. There were a thousand thousands that kept ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand that kept standing right before him. The Court took its seat, and there were books that were opened.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“I kept on beholding at that time because of the sound of the grandiose words that the horn was speaking; I kept on beholding until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed and it was given to the burning fire.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But as for the rest of the beasts, their rulerships were taken away, and there was a lengthening in life given to them for a time and a season.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within on account of it, and the very visions of my head began to frighten me.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">I went up close to one of those who were standing, that I might request from him reliable information on all this. And he said to me, as he went on to make known to me the very interpretation of the matters,</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“‘As for these huge beasts, because they are four, there are four kings that will stand up from the earth.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But the holy ones of the Supreme One will receive the kingdom, and they will take possession of the kingdom for time indefinite, even for time indefinite upon times indefinite.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Then it was that I desired to make certain concerning the fourth beast, which proved to be different from all the others, extraordinarily fearsome, the teeth of which were of iron and the claws of which were of copper, which was devouring [and] crushing, and which was treading down even what was left with its feet;</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] that came up and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking grandiose things and the appearance of which was bigger than that of its fellows.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“I kept on beholding when that very horn made war upon the holy ones, and it was prevailing against them,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">until the Ancient of Days came and judgment itself was given in favor of the holy ones of the Supreme One, and the definite time arrived that the holy ones took possession of the kingdom itself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“This is what he said, ‘As for the fourth beast, there is a fourth kingdom that will come to be on the earth, that will be different from all the [other] kingdoms; and it will devour all the earth and will trample it down and crush it.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And as for the ten horns, out of that kingdom there are ten kings that will rise up; and still another one will rise up after them, and he himself will be different from the first ones, and three kings he will humiliate.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And he will speak even words against the Most High, and he will harass continually the holy ones themselves of the Supreme One. And he will intend to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time, and times and half a time.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the Court itself proceeded to sit, and his own rulership they finally took away, in order to annihilate [him] and to destroy [him] totally.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“‘And the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One. Their kingdom is an indefinitely lasting kingdom, and all the rulerships will serve and obey even them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“Up to this point is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my own thoughts kept frightening me a great deal, so that my very complexion changed in me; but the matter itself I kept in my own heart.”</span>

       <span id="vs3">When I raised my eyes, then I saw, and, look! a ram standing before the watercourse, and it had two horns. And the two horns were tall, but the one was taller than the other, and the taller was the one that came up afterward.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I saw the ram making thrusts to the west and to the north and to the south, and no wild beasts kept standing before it, and there was no one doing any delivering out of its hand. And it did according to its will, and it put on great airs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I, for my part, kept on considering, and, look! there was a male of the goats coming from the sunset upon the surface of the whole earth, and it was not touching the earth. And as regards the he-goat, there was a conspicuous horn between its eyes.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And it kept coming all the way to the ram possessing the two horns, which I had seen standing before the watercourse; and it came running toward it in its powerful rage.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I saw it coming into close touch with the ram, and it began showing bitterness toward it, and it proceeded to strike down the ram and to break its two horns, and there proved to be no power in the ram to stand before it. So it threw it to the earth and trampled it down, and the ram proved to have no deliverer out of its hand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the male of the goats, for its part, put on great airs to an extreme; but as soon as it became mighty, the great horn was broken, and there proceeded to come up conspicuously four instead of it, toward the four winds of the heavens.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And out of one of them there came forth another horn, a small one, and it kept getting very much greater toward the south and toward the sunrising and toward the Decoration.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And it kept getting greater all the way to the army of the heavens, so that it caused some of the army and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it went trampling them down.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all the way to the Prince of the army it put on great airs, and from him the constant [feature] was taken away, and the established place of his sanctuary was thrown down.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And an army itself was gradually given over, together with the constant [feature], because of transgression; and it kept throwing truth to the earth, and it acted and had success.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I got to hear a certain holy one speaking, and another holy one proceeded to say to the particular one who was speaking: “How long will the vision be of the constant [feature] and of the transgression causing desolation, to make both [the] holy place and [the] army things to trample on?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So he said to me: “Until two thousand three hundred evenings [and] mornings; and [the] holy place will certainly be brought into its right condition.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then it came about that, while I myself, Daniel, was seeing the vision and seeking an understanding, why, look! there was standing in front of me someone in appearance like an able-bodied man.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I began to hear the voice of an earthling man in the midst of the U&acute;lai, and he proceeded to call out and say: “Ga&acute;bri&middot;el, make that one there understand the thing seen.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So he came beside where I was standing, but when he came I got terrified so that I fell upon my face. And he proceeded to say to me: “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of [the] end.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And while he was speaking with me, I had become fast asleep on my face on the earth. So he touched me and made me stand up where I had been standing.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he went on to say: “Here I am causing you to know what will occur in the final part of the denunciation, because it is for the appointed time of [the] end.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“The ram that you saw possessing the two horns [stands for] the kings of Me&acute;di&middot;a and Persia.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the hairy he-goat [stands for] the king of Greece; and as for the great horn that was between its eyes, it [stands for] the first king.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And that one having been broken, so that there were four that finally stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from [his] nation that will stand up, but not with his power.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“And in the final part of their kingdom, as the transgressors act to a completion, there will stand up a king fierce in countenance and understanding ambiguous sayings.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And his power must become mighty, but not by his own power. And in a wonderful way he will cause ruin, and he will certainly prove successful and do effectively. And he will actually bring mighty ones to ruin, also the people made up of [the] holy ones.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And according to his insight he will also certainly cause deception to succeed in his hand. And in his heart he will put on great airs, and during a freedom from care he will bring many to ruin. And against the Prince of princes he will stand up, but it will be without hand that he will be broken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“And the thing seen concerning the evening and the morning, which has been said, it is true. And you, for your part, keep secret the vision, because it is yet for many days.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And as for me, Daniel, I felt exhausted and was made sick for [some] days. Then I got up and did the work of the king; but I kept showing myself numbed on account of the thing seen, and there was nobody understanding [it].</span>

       <span id="vs1">In the first year of Da&middot;ri&acute;us the son of A&middot;has&middot;u&middot;e&acute;rus of the seed of the Medes, who had been made king over the kingdom of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">in the first year of his reigning I myself, Daniel, discerned by the books the number of the years concerning which the word of Jehovah had occurred to Jeremiah the prophet, for fulfilling the devastations of Jerusalem, [namely,] seventy years.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And I proceeded to set my face to Jehovah the [true] God, in order to seek [him] with prayer and with entreaties, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I began to pray to Jehovah my God and to make confession and to say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">“Ah Jehovah the [true] God, the great One and the fear-inspiring One, keeping the covenant and the loving-kindness to those loving him and to those keeping his commandments,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled; and there has been a turning aside from your commandments and from your judicial decisions.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And we have not listened to your servants the prophets, who have spoken in your name to our kings, our princes and our forefathers and to all the people of the land.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">To you, O Jehovah, there belongs the righteousness, but to us the shame of face as at this day, to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all those of Israel, those nearby and those far away in all the lands to which you dispersed them because of their unfaithfulness with which they acted against you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“O Jehovah, to us belongs the shame of face, to our kings, to our princes and to our forefathers, because we have sinned against you.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">To Jehovah our God belong the mercies and the acts of forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God by walking in his laws that he set before us by the hand of his servants the prophets.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all those of Israel have overstepped your law, and there has been a turning aside by not obeying your voice, so that you poured out upon us the curse and the sworn oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of the [true] God, for we have sinned against Him.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he proceeded to carry out his words that he had spoken against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great calamity, such as was not done under the whole heavens as what has been done in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity—it has come upon us, and we have not softened the face of Jehovah our God by turning back from our error and by showing insight into your trueness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And Jehovah kept alert to the calamity and finally brought it upon us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works that he has done; and we have not obeyed his voice.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“And now, O Jehovah our God, you who brought your people out from the land of Egypt by a strong hand and proceeded to make a name for yourself as at this day, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">O Jehovah, according to all your acts of righteousness, please, may your anger and your rage turn back from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; for, because of our sins and because of the errors of our forefathers, Jerusalem and your people are an object of reproach to all those round about us.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And now listen, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his entreaties, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolated, for the sake of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Incline your ear, O my God, and hear. Do open your eyes and see our desolated conditions and the city that has been called by your name; for not according to our righteous acts are we letting our entreaties fall before you, but according to your many mercies.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. O Jehovah, do pay attention and act. Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">While I was yet speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and letting my request for favor fall before Jehovah my God concerning the holy mountain of my God,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and [while] I was yet speaking in the prayer, why, the man Ga&acute;bri&middot;el, whom I had seen in the vision at the start, having been made weary with tiredness, was arriving by me at the time of the evening gift offering.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And he proceeded to impart understanding and speak with me and say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs22-2">“O Daniel, now I have come forth to make you have insight with understanding.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At the start of your entreaties a word went forth, and I myself have come to make report, because you are someone very desirable. So give consideration to the matter, and have understanding in the thing seen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“There are seventy weeks that have been determined upon your people and upon your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, and to finish off sin, and to make atonement for error, and to bring in righteousness for times indefinite, and to imprint a seal upon vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And you should know and have the insight [that] from the going forth of [the] word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Mes&middot;si&acute;ah [the] Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“And after the sixty-two weeks Mes&middot;si&acute;ah will be cut off, with nothing for himself.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs26-2">“And the city and the holy place the people of a leader that is coming will bring to their ruin. And the end of it will be by the flood. And until [the] end there will be war; what is decided upon is desolations.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“And he must keep [the] covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs27-2">“And upon the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation; and until an extermination, the very thing decided upon will go pouring out also upon the one lying desolate.”</span>

       <span id="vs5">I also proceeded to raise my eyes and see, and here was a certain man clothed in linen, with his hips girded with gold of U&acute;phaz.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And his body was like chrys&acute;o&middot;lite, and his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like fiery torches, and his arms and the place of his feet were like the sight of burnished copper, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a crowd.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I saw, I Daniel by myself, the appearance; but as for the men that happened to be with me, they did not see the appearance. However, there was a great trembling that fell upon them, so that they went running away in hiding themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And I—I was left remaining by myself, so that I saw this great appearance. And there was left remaining in me no power, and my own dignity became changed upon me to ruination, and I retained no power.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And I began hearing the sound of his words; and while I was hearing the sound of his words, I myself also happened to be fast asleep upon my face, with my face to the earth.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And, look! there was a hand that touched me, and it gradually stirred me up to [get] upon my knees and the palms of my hands.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he proceeded to say to me:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-2">“O Daniel, you very desirable man, have understanding in the words that I am speaking to you, and stand up where you were standing, for now I have been sent to you.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-3">And when he spoke with me this word, I did stand up, shivering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went on to say to me: “Do not be afraid, O Daniel, for from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and humbling yourself before your God your words have been heard, and I myself have come because of your words.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But the prince of the royal realm of Persia was standing in opposition to me for twenty-one days, and, look! Mi&acute;cha&middot;el, one of the foremost princes, came to help me; and I, for my part, remained there beside the kings of Persia.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And I have come to cause you to discern what will befall your people in the final part of the days, because it is a vision yet for the days [to come].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now when he spoke with me words like these, I had set my face to the earth and had become speechless.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And, look! one similar to the likeness of the sons of mankind was touching my lips, and I began to open my mouth and speak and say to the one who was standing in front of me: “O my lord, because of the appearance my convulsions were turned within me, and I did not retain any power.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So how was the servant of this my lord able to speak with this my lord? And as for me, up to now there kept standing in me no power, and no breath at all was left remaining in me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the one like the appearance of an earthling man proceeded to touch me again and strengthen me.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then he said: “Do not be afraid, O very desirable man. May you have peace. Be strong, yes, be strong.” And as soon as he spoke with me I exerted my strength and finally said: “Let my lord speak, because you have strengthened me.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So he went on to say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs20-2">“Do you really know why I have come to you? And now I shall go back to fight with the prince of Persia. When I am going forth, look! also the prince of Greece is coming.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">However, I shall tell you the things noted down in the writing of truth, and there is no one holding strongly with me in these [things] but Mi&acute;cha&middot;el, the prince of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">“And as for me, in the first year of Da&middot;ri&acute;us the Mede I stood up as a strengthener and as a fortress to him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And now what is truth I shall tell to you:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">“Look! There will yet be three kings standing up for Persia, and the fourth one will amass greater riches than all [others]. And as soon as he has become strong in his riches, he will rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“And a mighty king will certainly stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do according to his will.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And when he will have stood up, his kingdom will be broken and be divided toward the four winds of the heavens, but not to his posterity and not according to his dominion with which he had ruled; because his kingdom will be uprooted, even for others than these.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“And the king of the south will become strong, even [one] of his princes; and he will prevail against him and will certainly rule with extensive dominion [greater than] that one’s ruling power.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“And at the end of [some] years they will ally themselves with each other, and the very daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north in order to make an equitable arrangement. But she will not retain the power of her arm; and he will not stand, neither his arm; and she will be given up, she herself, and those bringing her in, and he who caused her birth, and the one making her strong in [those] times.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And one from the sprout of her roots will certainly stand up in his position, and he will come to the military force and come against the fortress of the king of the north and will certainly act against them and prevail.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And also with their gods, with their molten images, with their desirable articles of silver and of gold, [and] with the captives he will come to Egypt. And he himself will for [some] years stand off from the king of the north.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“And he will actually come into the kingdom of the king of the south and go back to his own soil.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Now as for his sons, they will excite themselves and actually gather together a crowd of large military forces. And in coming he will certainly come and flood over and pass through. But he will go back, and he will excite himself all the way to his fortress.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“And the king of the south will embitter himself and will have to go forth and fight with him, [that is,] with the king of the north; and he will certainly have a large crowd stand up, and the crowd will actually be given into the hand of that one.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the crowd will certainly be carried away. His heart will become exalted, and he will actually cause tens of thousands to fall; but he will not use his strong position.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“And the king of the north must return and set up a crowd larger than the first; and at the end of the times, [some] years, he will come, doing so with a great military force and with a great deal of goods.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And in those times there will be many who will stand up against the king of the south.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs14-2">“And the sons of the robbers belonging to your people will, for their part, be carried along to try making a vision come true; and they will have to stumble.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“And the king of the north will come and throw up a siege rampart and actually capture a city with fortifications. And as for the arms of the south, they will not stand, neither the people of his picked ones; and there will be no power to keep standing.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the one coming against him will do according to his will, and there will be no one standing before him. And he will stand in the land of the Decoration, and there will be extermination in his hand.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he will set his face to come with the forcefulness of his entire kingdom, and there will be equitable [terms] with him; and he will act effectively. And as regards the daughter of womankind, it will be granted to him to bring her to ruin. And she will not stand, and she will not continue to be his.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And he will turn his face back to the coastlands and will actually capture many. And a commander will have to make the reproach from him cease for himself, [so that] his reproach will not be. He will make it turn back upon that one.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he will turn his face back to the fortresses of his [own] land, and he will certainly stumble and fall, and he will not be found.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And there must stand up in his position one who is causing an exactor to pass through the splendid kingdom, and in a few days he will be broken, but not in anger nor in warfare.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“And there must stand up in his position one who is to be despised, and they will certainly not set upon him the dignity of [the] kingdom; and he will actually come in during a freedom from care and take hold of [the] kingdom by means of smoothness.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And as regards the arms of the flood, they will be flooded over on account of him, and they will be broken; as will also the Leader of [the] covenant.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And because of their allying themselves with him he will carry on deception and actually come up and become mighty by means of a little nation.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">During freedom from care, even into the fatness of the jurisdictional district he will enter in and actually do what his fathers and the fathers of his fathers have not done. Plunder and spoil and goods he will scatter among them; and against fortified places he will scheme out his schemes, but only until a time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“And he will arouse his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great military force; and the king of the south, for his part, will excite himself for the war with an exceedingly great and mighty military force. And he will not stand, because they will scheme out against him schemes.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the very ones eating his delicacies will bring his breakdown.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs26-2">“And as for his military force, it will be flooded away, and many will certainly fall down slain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“And as regards these two kings, their heart will be inclined to doing what is bad, and at one table a lie is what they will keep speaking. But nothing will succeed, because [the] end is yet for the time appointed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“And he will go back to his land with a great amount of goods, and his heart will be against the holy covenant. And he will act effectively and certainly go back to his land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“At the time appointed he will go back, and he will actually come against the south; but it will not prove to be at the last the same as at the first.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And there will certainly come against him the ships of Kit&acute;tim, and he will have to become dejected.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs30-2">“And he will actually go back and hurl denunciations against the holy covenant and act effectively; and he will have to go back and will give consideration to those leaving the holy covenant.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And there will be arms that will stand up, proceeding from him; and they will actually profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and remove the constant [feature].</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs31-2">“And they will certainly put in place the disgusting thing that is causing desolation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“And those who are acting wickedly against [the] covenant, he will lead into apostasy by means of smooth words. But as regards the people who are knowing their God, they will prevail and act effectively.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And as regards those having insight among the people, they will impart understanding to the many. And they will certainly be made to stumble by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plundering, for [some] days.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But when they are made to stumble they will be helped with a little help; and many will certainly join themselves to them by means of smoothness.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And some of those having insight will be made to stumble, in order to do a refining work because of them and to do a cleansing and to do a whitening, until the time of [the] end; because it is yet for the time appointed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“And the king will actually do according to his own will, and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god; and against the God of gods he will speak marvelous things. And he will certainly prove successful until [the] denunciation will have come to a finish; because the thing decided upon must be done.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And to the God of his fathers he will give no consideration; and to the desire of women and to every other god he will give no consideration, but over everyone he will magnify himself.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">But to the god of fortresses, in his position he will give glory; and to a god that his fathers did not know he will give glory by means of gold and by means of silver and by means of precious stone and by means of desirable things.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And he will act effectively against the most fortified strongholds, along with a foreign god. Whoever has given [him] recognition he will make abound with glory, and he will actually make them rule among many; and [the] ground he will apportion out for a price.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“And in the time of [the] end the king of the south will engage with him in a pushing, and against him the king of the north will storm with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships; and he will certainly enter into the lands and flood over and pass through.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">He will also actually enter into the land of the Decoration, and there will be many [lands] that will be made to stumble. But these are the ones that will escape out of his hand, E&acute;dom and Mo&acute;ab and the main part of the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And he will keep thrusting out his hand against the lands; and as regards the land of Egypt, she will not prove to be an escapee.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And he will actually rule over the hidden treasures of the gold and the silver and over all the desirable things of Egypt. And the Lib&acute;y&middot;ans and the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans will be at his steps.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“But there will be reports that will disturb him, out of the sunrising and out of the north, and he will certainly go forth in a great rage in order to annihilate and to devote many to destruction.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And he will plant his palatial tents between [the] grand sea and the holy mountain of Decoration; and he will have to come all the way to his end, and there will be no helper for him.</span>

And there will certainly occur a time of distress such as has not been made to occur since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time your people will escape, every one who is found written down in the book.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And there will be many of those asleep in the ground of dust who will wake up, these to indefinitely lasting life and those to reproaches [and] to indefinitely lasting abhorrence.</span>

       <span id="vs7">And I began to hear the man clothed with the linen, who was up above the waters of the stream, as he proceeded to raise his right [hand] and his left [hand] to the heavens and to swear by the One who is alive for time indefinite: “It will be for an appointed time, appointed times and a half. And as soon as there will have been a finishing of the dashing of the power of the holy people to pieces, all these things will come to their finish.”</span>

       <span id="vs8">Now as for me, I heard, but I could not understand; so that I said: “O my lord, what will be the final part of these things?”</span>
