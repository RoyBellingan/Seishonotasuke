<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="24">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Ga&middot;la&acute;ti&middot;a:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">He gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from the present wicked system of things according to the will of our God and Father,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">I marvel that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are being so quickly removed from the One who called <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with Christ’s undeserved kindness over to another sort of good news.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But it is not another; only there are certain ones who are causing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> trouble and wanting to pervert the good news about the Christ.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as good news something beyond what we declared to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as good news, let him be accursed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">As we have said above, I also now say again, Whoever it is that is declaring to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as good news something beyond what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> accepted, let him be accursed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For I put <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on notice, brothers, that the good news which was declared by me as good news is not something human;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught [it], except through revelation by Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Ju&acute;da&middot;ism, that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and I was making greater progress in Ju&acute;da&middot;ism than many of my own age in my race, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called [me] through his undeserved kindness, thought good</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">to reveal his Son in connection with me, that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not go at once into conference with flesh and blood.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles previous to me, but I went off into Arabia, and I came back again to Damascus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Ce&acute;phas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But I saw no one else of the apostles, only James the brother of the Lord.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now as to the things I am writing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, look! in the sight of God, I am not lying.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that I went into the regions of Syria and of Ci&middot;li&acute;cia.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But I was unknown by face to the congregations of Ju&middot;de&acute;a that were in union with Christ;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">they only used to hear: “The man that formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith which he formerly devastated.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So they began glorifying God because of me.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="21">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Bar&acute;na&middot;bas, taking also Titus along with me.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But I went up as a result of a revelation. And I laid before them the good news which I am preaching among the nations, privately, however, before those who were outstanding men, for fear that somehow I was running or had run in vain.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Nevertheless, not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But because of the false brothers brought in quietly, who sneaked in to spy upon our freedom which we have in union with Christ Jesus, that they might completely enslave us—</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">to these we did not yield by way of submission, no, not for an hour, in order that the truth of the good news might continue with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But on the part of those who seemed to be something—whatever sort of men they formerly were makes no difference to me—God does not go by a man’s outward appearance—to me, in fact, those outstanding men imparted nothing new.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But, on the contrary, when they saw that I had entrusted to me the good news for those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter [had it] for those who are circumcised—</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">for He who gave Peter powers necessary for an apostleship to those who are circumcised gave powers also to me for those who are of the nations;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">yes, when they came to know the undeserved kindness that was given me, James and Ce&acute;phas and John, the ones who seemed to be pillars, gave me and Bar&acute;na&middot;bas the right hand of sharing together, that we should go to the nations, but they to those who are circumcised.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Only we should keep the poor in mind. This very thing I have also earnestly endeavored to do.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, when Ce&acute;phas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face, because he stood condemned.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For before the arrival of certain men from James, he used to eat with people of the nations; but when they arrived, he went withdrawing and separating himself, in fear of those of the circumcised class.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense, so that even Bar&acute;na&middot;bas was led along with them in their pretense.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But when I saw they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news, I said to Ce&acute;phas before them all: “If you, though you are a Jew, live as the nations do, and not as Jews do, how is it that you are compelling people of the nations to live according to Jewish practice?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners from the nations,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">knowing as we do that a man is declared righteous, not due to works of law, but only through faith toward Christ Jesus, even we have put our faith in Christ Jesus, that we may be declared righteous due to faith toward Christ, and not due to works of law, because due to works of law no flesh will be declared righteous.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Now if we, in seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ, have also ourselves been found sinners, is Christ in reality sin’s minister? May that never happen!</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For if the very things that I once threw down I build up again, I demonstrate myself to be a transgressor.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As for me, through law I died toward law, that I might become alive toward God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">I am impaled along with Christ. It is no longer I that live, but it is Christ that is living in union with me. Indeed, the life that I now live in flesh I live by the faith that is toward the Son of God, who loved me and handed himself over for me.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">I do not shove aside the undeserved kindness of God; for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing.</span>

       <span id="vs1">O senseless Ga&middot;la&acute;tians, who is it that brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> under evil influence, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed impaled?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This alone I want to learn from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> receive the spirit due to works of law or due to a hearing by faith?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> so senseless? After starting in spirit are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> now being completed in flesh?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> undergo so many sufferings to no purpose? If it really was to no purpose.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">He, therefore, who supplies <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the spirit and performs powerful works among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, does he do it owing to works of law or owing to a hearing by faith?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Just as Abraham “put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”</span>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs8">Now the Scripture, seeing in advance that God would declare people of the nations righteous due to faith, declared the good news beforehand to Abraham, namely: “By means of you all the nations will be blessed.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs11">Moreover, that by law no one is declared righteous with God is evident, because “the righteous one will live by reason of faith.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now the Law does not adhere to faith, but “he that does them shall live by means of them.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Christ by purchase released us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: “Accursed is every man hanged upon a stake.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham might come to be by means of Jesus Christ for the nations, that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Brothers, I speak with a human illustration: A validated covenant, though it is a man’s, no one sets aside or attaches additions to it.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It says, not: “And to seeds,” as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one: “And to your seed,” who is Christ.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Further, I say this: As to the covenant previously validated by God, the Law that has come into being four hundred and thirty years later does not invalidate it, so as to abolish the promise.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For if the inheritance is due to law, it is no longer due to promise; whereas God has kindly given it to Abraham through a promise.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the seed should arrive to whom the promise had been made; and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now there is no mediator where only one person is concerned, but God is only one.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? May that never happen! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, righteousness would actually have been by means of law.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But the Scripture delivered up all things together to the custody of sin, that the promise resulting from faith toward Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">However, before the faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being delivered up together into custody, looking to the faith that was destined to be revealed.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Consequently the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a tutor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are all, in fact, sons of God through <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are all one [person] in union with Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Moreover, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> belong to Christ, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="31">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now I say that as long as the heir is a babe he does not differ at all from a slave, lord of all things though he is,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">but he is under men in charge and under stewards until the day his father appointed beforehand.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Likewise we also, when we were babes, continued enslaved by the elementary things belonging to the world.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But when the full limit of the time arrived, God sent forth his Son, who came to be out of a woman and who came to be under law,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">that he might release by purchase those under law, that we, in turn, might receive the adoption as sons.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Now because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts and it cries out: <i>“Abba,</i> Father!”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So, then, you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, also an heir through God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Nevertheless, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not know God, then it was that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> slaved for those who by nature are not gods.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But now that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have come to know God, or rather now that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have come to be known by God, how is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are turning back again to the weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">I fear for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that somehow I have toiled to no purpose respecting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Brothers, I beg <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Become as I am, because I used to be also as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> did me no wrong.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that it was through a sickness of my flesh I declared the good news to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the first time.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And what was a trial to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in my flesh, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not treat with contempt or spit at in disgust; but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Where, then, is that happiness <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had? For I bear <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> witness that, if it had been possible, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would have gouged out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes and given them to me.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Well, then, have I become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemy because I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They zealously seek <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, not in a fine way, but they want to shut <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> off [from me], that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may zealously seek them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">However, it is fine for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be zealously sought for in a fine cause at all times, and not only when I am present with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">my little children, with whom I am again in childbirth pains until Christ is formed in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But I could wish to be present with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> just now and to speak in a different way, because I am perplexed over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Tell me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who want to be under law, Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not hear the Law?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For example, it is written that Abraham acquired two sons, one by the servant girl and one by the free woman;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but the one by the servant girl was actually born in the manner of flesh, the other by the free woman through a promise.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">These things stand as a symbolic drama; for these [women] mean two covenants, the one from Mount Si&acute;nai, which brings forth children for slavery, and which is Ha&acute;gar.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now this Ha&acute;gar means Si&acute;nai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For it is written: “Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break out and cry aloud, you woman who does not have childbirth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than [those] of her who has the husband.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But just as then the one born in the manner of flesh began persecuting the one born in the manner of spirit, so also now.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Nevertheless, what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the servant girl and her son, for by no means shall the son of the servant girl be an heir with the son of the free woman.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Wherefore, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">See! I, Paul, am telling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Moreover, I bear witness again to every man getting circumcised that he is under obligation to perform the whole Law.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are parted from Christ, whoever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are that try to be declared righteous by means of law; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have fallen away from his undeserved kindness.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For our part we by spirit are eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness as a result of faith.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For as regards Christ Jesus neither circumcision is of any value nor is uncircumcision, but faith operating through love [is].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> were running well. Who hindered <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from keeping on obeying the truth?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">This sort of persuasion is not from the One calling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">A little leaven ferments the whole lump.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">I am confident about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are in union with [the] Lord that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> trouble will bear [his] judgment, no matter who he may be.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then, indeed, the stumbling block of the torture stake has been abolished.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I wish the men who are trying to overturn <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would even get themselves emasculated.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> were, of course, called for freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an inducement for the flesh, but through love slave for one another.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">If, though, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not get annihilated by one another.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But I say, Keep walking by spirit and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will carry out no fleshly desire at all.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would like to do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not do.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Furthermore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are being led by spirit, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not under law.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs1">Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving his own mind.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But let each one prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For each one will carry his own load.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Moreover, let anyone who is being orally taught the word share in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching.</span>

       <span id="vs7">Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">because he who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but he who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to [us] in the faith.</span>

       <span id="vs13">For not even do those who are getting circumcised keep the Law themselves, but they want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be circumcised that they may have cause for boasting in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flesh.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Never may it occur that I should boast, except in the torture stake of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been impaled to me and I to the world.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation [is something].</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</span>
