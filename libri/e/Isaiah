<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The vision of Isaiah the son of A&acute;moz that he visioned concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah, Jo&acute;tham, A&acute;haz [and] Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, kings of Judah:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken: “Sons I have brought up and raised, but they themselves have revolted against me.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">A bull well knows its buyer, and the ass the manger of its owner; Israel itself has not known, my own people have not behaved understandingly.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Woe to the sinful nation, the people heavy with error, an evildoing seed, ruinous sons! They have left Jehovah, they have treated the Holy One of Israel with disrespect, they have turned backwards.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Where else will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be struck still more, in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> add more revolt? The whole head is in a sick condition, and the whole heart is feeble.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no sound spot in it. Wounds and bruises and fresh stripes—they have not been squeezed out or bound up, nor has there been a softening with oil.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> land is a desolation, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> cities are burned with fire; <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ground—right in front of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> strangers are eating it up, and the desolation is like an overthrow by strangers.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the daughter of Zion has been left remaining like a booth in a vineyard, like a lookout hut in a field of cucumbers, like a blockaded city.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Unless Jehovah of armies himself had left remaining to us just a few survivors, we should have become just like Sod&acute;om, we should have resembled Go&middot;mor&acute;rah itself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Hear the word of Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> dictators of Sod&acute;om. Give ear to the law of our God, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people of Go&middot;mor&acute;rah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Of what benefit to me is the multitude of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sacrifices?” says Jehovah. “I have had enough of whole burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed animals; and in the blood of young bulls and male lambs and he-goats I have taken no delight.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people keep coming in to see my face, who is it that has required this from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand, to trample my courtyards?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Stop bringing in any more valueless grain offerings. Incense—it is something detestable to me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of a convention—I cannot put up with the [use of] uncanny power along with the solemn assembly.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> new moons and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> festal seasons my soul has hated. To me they have become a burden; I have become tired of bearing [them].</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> spread out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> palms, I hide my eyes from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Even though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> make many prayers, I am not listening; with bloodshed <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> very hands have become filled.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the badness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings from in front of my eyes; cease to do bad.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Learn to do good; search for justice; set right the oppressor; render judgment for the fatherless boy; plead the cause of the widow.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Come, now, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and let us set matters straight between us,” says Jehovah. “Though the sins of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people should prove to be as scarlet, they will be made white just like snow; though they should be red like crimson cloth, they will become even like wool.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people show willingness and do listen, the good of the land <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people refuse and are actually rebellious, with a sword <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be eaten up; for the very mouth of Jehovah has spoken [it].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">O how the faithful town has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness itself used to lodge in her, but now murderers.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Your silver itself has become scummy dross. Your wheat beer is diluted with water.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Your princes are stubborn and partners with thieves. Every one of them is a lover of a bribe and a chaser after gifts. For a fatherless boy they do not render judgment; and even the legal case of a widow does not get admittance to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore the utterance of the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, the Powerful One of Israel, is: “Aha! I shall relieve myself of my adversaries, and I will avenge myself on my enemies.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And I will turn back my hand upon you, and I shall smelt away your scummy dross as with lye, and I will remove all your waste products.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And I will bring back again judges for you as at the first, and counselors for you as at the start. After this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">With justice Zion herself will be redeemed, and those returning of her, with righteousness.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the crash of revolters and that of sinful ones will be at the same time, and those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people desired, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be abashed because of the gardens that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have chosen.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will become like a big tree the foliage of which is withering, and like a garden that has no water.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the vigorous man will certainly become tow, and the product of his activity a spark; and both of them will certainly go up in flames at the same time, with no one to do the extinguishing.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">For, look! the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, is removing from Jerusalem and from Judah support and stay, the whole support of bread and the whole support of water,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">mighty man and warrior, judge and prophet, and practicer of divination and elderly man,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">chief of fifty and highly respected man and counselor and expert in magical arts, and the skilled charmer.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I shall certainly make boys their princes, and mere arbitrary power will rule over them.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the people will actually tyrannize one over the other, even each one over his fellowman. They will storm, the boy against the old man, and the lightly esteemed one against the one to be honored.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For each one will lay hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying:] “You have a mantle. A dictator you ought to become to us, and this overthrown mass should be under your hand.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He will raise [his voice] in that day, saying: “I shall not become a wound dresser; and in my house there is neither bread nor a mantle. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men must not set me as dictator over the people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah itself has fallen, because their tongue and their dealings are against Jehovah, in behaving rebelliously in the eyes of his glory.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The very expression of their faces actually testifies against them, and of their sin like that of Sod&acute;om they do tell. They have not hidden [it]. Woe to their soul! For they have dealt out to themselves calamity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Say, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, that it [will be] well with the righteous one, for they will eat the very fruitage of their dealings.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Woe to the wicked one!—Calamity; for the treatment [rendered] by his own hands will be rendered to him!</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for my people, its task assigners are dealing severely, and mere women actually rule over it. O my people, those leading you on are causing [you] to wander, and the way of your paths they have confused.</span>

       <span id="vs15">What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men mean in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> crush my people, and that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> grind the very faces of the afflicted ones?” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.</span>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Jehovah says: “For the reason that the daughters of Zion have become haughty and they walk with their throats stretched forth and ogling with their eyes, they go walking with tripping steps, and with their feet they make a tinkling sound,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Jehovah also will actually make the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion scabby, and Jehovah himself will lay their very forehead bare.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In that day Jehovah will take away the beauty of the bangles and the headbands and the moon-shaped ornaments,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">the eardrops and the bracelets and the veils,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">the headdresses and the step chains and the breastbands and the ‘houses of the soul’ and the ornamental humming shells,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">the finger rings and the nose rings,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">the robes of state and the overtunics and the cloaks and the purses,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and the hand mirrors and the undergarments and the turbans and the large veils.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“And it must occur that instead of balsam oil there will come to be merely a musty smell; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of an artistic hair arrangement, baldness; and instead of a rich garment, a girding of sackcloth; a brand mark instead of prettiness.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">By the sword your own men will fall, and your mightiness by war.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And her entrances will have to mourn and express sorrow, and she will certainly be cleaned out. She will sit down on the very earth.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to dig it up and to rid it of stones and to plant it with a choice red vine, and to build a tower in the middle of it. And there was also a winepress that he hewed out in it. And he kept hoping for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“And now, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabitants of Jerusalem and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">What is there yet to do for my vineyard that I have not already done in it? Why is it that I hoped for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And now, please, may I make known to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men what I am doing to my vineyard: There will be a removing of its hedge, and it must be destined for burning down. There must be a breaking down of its stone wall, and it must be destined for a place of trampling.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I shall set it as a thing destroyed. It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed. And it must come up with the thornbush and weeds; and upon the clouds I shall lay a command to keep from precipitating any rain upon it.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For the vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plantation of which he was fond. And he kept hoping for judgment, but, look! the breaking of law; for righteousness, but, look! an outcry.”</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

       <span id="vs9">In my ears Jehovah of armies [has sworn that] many houses, though great and good, will become an outright object of astonishment, without an inhabitant.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For even ten acres of vineyard will produce but one bath measure, and even a ho&acute;mer measure of seed will produce but an e&acute;phah measure.</span>

       <span id="vs11">Woe to those who are getting up early in the morning that they may seek just intoxicating liquor, who are lingering till late in the evening darkness so that wine itself inflames them!</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And there must prove to be harp and stringed instrument, tambourine and flute, and wine at their feasts; but the activity of Jehovah they do not look at, and the work of his hands they have not seen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs14">Therefore She&acute;ol has made its soul spacious and has opened its mouth wide beyond bounds; and what is splendid in her, also her crowd and her uproar and the exultant one, will certainly go down into it.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And earthling man will bow down, and man will become low, and even the eyes of the high ones will become low.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Jehovah of armies will become high through judgment, and the [true] God, the Holy One, will certainly sanctify himself through righteousness.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the male lambs will actually graze as in their pasture; and the desolate places of well-fed animals alien residents will eat.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Woe to those drawing error with ropes of untruth, and as with wagon cords sin;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">those who are saying: “Let his work hasten; do let it come quickly, in order that we may see [it]; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know [it]!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness, those who are putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Woe to those wise in their own eyes and discreet even in front of their own faces!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine, and to the men with vital energy for mixing intoxicating liquor,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">those who are pronouncing the wicked one righteous in consideration of a bribe, and who take away even the righteousness of the righteous one from him!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore just as a tongue of fire eats up the stubble and into the flames mere dried grass sinks down, their very rootstock will become just like a musty smell, and their blossom itself will go up just like powder, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of armies, and the saying of the Holy One of Israel they have disrespected.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">That is why the anger of Jehovah has grown hot against his people, and he will stretch out his hand against them and strike them. And the mountains will be agitated, and their dead bodies will become like the offal in the midst of the streets.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs25-2">In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he has raised up a signal to a great nation far away, and he has whistled to it at the extremity of the earth; and, look! in haste it will swiftly come in.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">There is no one tired nor is anyone stumbling among them. No one is drowsy and no one sleeps. And the belt around their loins will certainly not be opened, nor the laces of their sandals be torn in two;</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">because their arrows are sharpened and all their bows are bent. The very hoofs of their horses will have to be accounted as flint itself, and their wheels as a storm wind.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The roaring of theirs is like that of a lion, and they roar like maned young lions. And they will growl and grab hold of the prey and bring [it] safely away, and there will be no deliverer.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And they will growl over it in that day as with the growling of the sea. And one will actually gaze at the land, and, look! there is distressing darkness; and even the light has grown dark because of the drops falling on it.</span>

       <span id="vs1">In the year that King Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah died I, however, got to see Jehovah, sitting on a throne lofty and lifted up, and his skirts were filling the temple.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Seraphs were standing above him. Each one had six wings. With two he kept his face covered, and with two he kept his feet covered, and with two he would fly about.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And this one called to that one and said: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies. The fullness of all the earth is his glory.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the pivots of the thresholds began to quiver at the voice of the one calling, and the house itself gradually filled with smoke.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I proceeded to say: “Woe to me! For I am as good as brought to silence, because a man unclean in lips I am, and in among a people unclean in lips I am dwelling; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of armies, himself!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that, one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand there was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs off the altar.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he proceeded to touch my mouth and to say: “Look! This has touched your lips, and your error has departed and your sin itself is atoned for.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And I began to hear the voice of Jehovah saying: “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I proceeded to say: “Here I am! Send me.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he went on to say: “Go, and you must say to this people, ‘Hear again and again, O men, but do not understand; and see again and again, but do not get any knowledge.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Make the heart of this people unreceptive, and make their very ears unresponsive, and paste their very eyes together, that they may not see with their eyes and with their ears they may not hear, and that their own heart may not understand and that they may not actually turn back and get healing for themselves.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At this I said: “How long, O Jehovah?” Then he said: “Until the cities actually crash in ruins, to be without an inhabitant, and the houses be without earthling man, and the ground itself is ruined into a desolation;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and Jehovah actually removes earthling men far away, and the deserted condition does become very extensive in the midst of the land.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And there will still be in it a tenth, and it must again become something for burning down, like a big tree and like a massive tree in which, when there is a cutting down [of them], there is a stump; a holy seed will be the stump of it.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And a report was made to the house of David, saying: “Syria has leaned upon E&acute;phra&middot;im.”</span>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">And his heart and the heart of his people began to quiver, like the quivering of the trees of the forest because of a wind.</span>

       <span id="vs5">for the reason that Syria [with] E&acute;phra&middot;im and the son of Rem&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah has advised what is bad against you, saying:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Let us go up against Judah and tear it apart and by breakthroughs take it for ourselves; and let us make another king reign inside it, the son of Tab&acute;e&middot;el.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “It will not stand, neither will it take place.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Re&acute;zin; and within just sixty-five years E&acute;phra&middot;im will be shattered to pieces so as not to be a people.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs13">And he proceeded to say: “Listen, please, O house of David. Is it such a little thing for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to tire out men, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should also tire out my God?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore Jehovah himself will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men a sign: Look!

       <span id="vs15">Butter and honey he will eat by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs19">and they will certainly come in and settle down, all of them, upon the precipitous torrent valleys and upon the clefts of the crags and upon all the thorn thickets and upon all the watering places.</span>

       <span id="vs20">“In that day, by means of a hired razor in the region of the River, even by means of the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, Jehovah will shave the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away even the beard itself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>

       <span id="vs22">And it must occur that, due to the abundance of the producing of milk, he will eat butter; because butter and honey are what everyone left remaining in the midst of the land will eat.</span>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“And it must occur in that day that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, will come to be—for the thornbushes and for the weeds it will come to be.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">With arrows and the bow he will come there, because all the land will become mere thornbushes and weeds.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And all the mountains that used to be cleared of troublesome plants with a hoe—you will not come there for fear of thornbushes and weeds; and it will certainly become a place for letting bulls loose and a trampling ground of sheep.”</span>

       <span id="vs7">even therefore, look! Jehovah is bringing up against them the mighty and the many waters of the River, the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a and all his glory. And he will certainly come up over all his streambeds and go over all his banks</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and move on through Judah. He will actually flood and pass over. Up to the neck he will reach. And the outspreading of his wings must occur to fill the breadth of your land, O Im&middot;man&acute;u&middot;el!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Be injurious, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> peoples, and be shattered to pieces; and give ear, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in distant parts of the earth! Gird yourselves, and be shattered to pieces! Gird yourselves, and be shattered to pieces!</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Plan out a scheme, and it will be broken up! Speak any word, and it will not stand, for God is with us!</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For this is what Jehovah has said to me with strongness of the hand, that he may make me turn aside from walking in the way of this people, saying:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men must not say, ‘A conspiracy!’ respecting all that of which this people keep saying, ‘A conspiracy!’ and the object of their fear <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men must not fear, nor must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> tremble at it.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Jehovah of armies—he is the One whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should treat as holy, and he should be the object of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fear, and he should be the One causing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to tremble.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he must become as a sacred place; but as a stone to strike against and as a rock over which to stumble to both the houses of Israel, as a trap and as a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And many among them will be certain to stumble and to fall and be broken, and to be snared and caught.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Wrap up the attestation, put a seal about the law among my disciples!</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I will keep in expectation of Jehovah, who is concealing his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Look! I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in Israel from Jehovah of armies, who is residing in Mount Zion.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And in case they should say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people: “Apply to the spiritistic mediums or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping and making utterances in low tones,” is it not to its God that any people should apply? [Should there be application] to dead persons in behalf of living persons?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">To the law and to the attestation!</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs20-2">Surely they will keep saying what is according to this statement that will have no light of dawn.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And each one will certainly pass through the land hard pressed and hungry; and it must occur that because he is hungry and has made himself feel indignant, he will actually call down evil upon his king and upon his God and will certainly peer upward.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And to the earth he will look, and, lo! distress and darkness, obscurity, hard times and gloominess with no brightness.</span>

       <span id="vs1">However, the obscureness will not be as when the land had stress, as at the former time when one treated with contempt the land of Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun and the land of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li and when at the later time one caused [it] to be honored—the way by the sea, in the region of the Jordan, Gal&acute;i&middot;lee of the nations.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light. As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">You have made the nation populous; for it you have made the rejoicing great. They have rejoiced before you as with the rejoicing in the harvesttime, as those who are joyful when they divide up the spoil.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For the yoke of their load and the rod upon their shoulders, the staff of the one driving them to work, you have shattered to pieces as in the day of Mid&acute;i&middot;an.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For every boot of the one tramping with tremors and the mantle rolled in blood have even come to be for burning as food for fire.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For there has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite. The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">There was a word that Jehovah sent against Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the people will certainly know [it], even all of them, E&acute;phra&middot;im and the inhabitant of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, because of [their] haughtiness and because of [their] insolence of heart in saying:</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Bricks are what have fallen, but with hewn stone we shall build. Sycamore trees are what have been cut down, but with cedars we shall make replacement.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah will set the adversaries of Re&acute;zin on high against him, and the enemies of that one he will goad on,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Syria from the east and the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines from behind, and they will eat up Israel with open mouth. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the people themselves have not returned to the One striking them, and Jehovah of armies they have not sought.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, shoot and rush, in one day.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">The aged and highly respected one is the head, and the prophet giving false instruction is the tail.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And those who are leading this people on prove to be the ones causing [them] to wander; and those of them who are being led on, the ones who are being confused.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">That is why Jehovah will not rejoice even over their young men, and upon their fatherless boys and upon their widows he will have no mercy; because all of them are apostates and evildoers and every mouth is speaking senselessness. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For wickedness has become aflame just like a fire; thornbushes and weeds it will eat up. And it will catch fire in the thickets of the forest, and they will be borne aloft as the billowing of smoke.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In the fury of Jehovah of armies the land has been set afire, and the people will become as food for the fire. No one will show compassion even on his brother.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And one will cut down on the right and will certainly be hungry; and one will eat on the left, and they will certainly not be satisfied. They will each one eat the flesh of his own arm,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh E&acute;phra&middot;im, and E&acute;phra&middot;im Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh. Together they will be against Judah. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still.</span>

       <span id="vs6">Against an apostate nation I shall send him, and against the people of my fury I shall issue a command to him, to take much spoil and to take much plunder and to make it a trampling place like the clay of the streets.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs13">For he has said, ‘With the power of my hand I shall certainly act, and with my wisdom, for I do have understanding; and I shall remove the boundaries of peoples, and their things stored up I shall certainly pillage, and I shall bring down the inhabitants just like a powerful one.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And just as if a nest, my hand will reach the resources of the peoples; and just as when one gathers eggs that have been left, I myself will gather up even all the earth, and there will certainly be no one fluttering [his] wings or opening [his] mouth or chirping.’”</span>

       <span id="vs16">Therefore the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies, will keep sending upon his fat ones a wasting disease, and under his glory a burning will keep burning away like the burning of a fire.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

       <span id="vs13">That is why I shall cause heaven itself to become agitated, and the earth will rock out of its place at the fury of Jehovah of armies and at the day of his burning anger.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And it must occur that, like a gazelle chased away and like a flock without anyone to collect them together, they will turn, each one to his own people; and they will flee, each one to his own land.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs16">and their very children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be pillaged, and their own wives will be raped.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Here I am arousing against them the Medes, who account silver itself as nothing and who, as respects gold, take no delight in it.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And [their] bows will dash even young men to pieces. And the fruitage of the belly they will not pity; for sons their eye will not feel sorry.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Babylon, the decoration of kingdoms, the beauty of the pride of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, must become as when God overthrew Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">She will never be inhabited, nor will she reside for generation after generation. And there the Arab will not pitch his tent, and no shepherds will let [their flocks] lie down there.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And there the haunters of waterless regions will certainly lie down, and their houses must be filled with eagle owls. And there the ostriches must reside, and goat-shaped demons themselves will go skipping about there.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And jackals must howl in her dwelling towers, and the big snake will be in the palaces of exquisite delight. And the season for her is near to come, and her days themselves will not be postponed.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And peoples will actually take them and bring them to their own place, and the house of Israel must take them to themselves as a possession upon the soil of Jehovah as menservants and as maidservants; and they must become the captors of those holding them captive, and they must have in subjection those who were driving them to work.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs4">that you must raise up this proverbial saying against the king of Babylon and say:</span>
</p>

<p>

       <span id="vs6">the one striking peoples in fury with a stroke incessantly, the one subduing nations in sheer anger with a persecution without restraint.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The whole earth has come to rest, has become free of disturbance. People have become cheerful with joyful cries.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Even the juniper trees have also rejoiced at you, the cedars of Leb&acute;a&middot;non, [saying,] ‘Ever since you have lain down, no [wood]cutter comes up against us.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Even She&acute;ol underneath has become agitated at you in order to meet you on coming in. At you it has awakened those impotent in death, all the goatlike leaders of the earth. It has made all the kings of the nations get up from their thrones.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">All of them speak up and say to you, ‘Have you yourself also been made weak like us? Is it to us that you have been made comparable?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Down to She&acute;ol your pride has been brought, the din of your stringed instruments. Beneath you, maggots are spread out as a couch; and worms are your covering.’</span>

       <span id="vs13">As for you, you have said in your heart, ‘To the heavens I shall go up. Above the stars of God I shall lift up my throne, and I shall sit down upon the mountain of meeting, in the remotest parts of the north.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

       <span id="vs16">Those seeing you will gaze even at you; they will give close examination even to you, [saying,] ‘Is this the man that was agitating the earth, that was making kingdoms rock,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">that made the productive land like the wilderness and that overthrew its very cities, that did not open the way homeward even for his prisoners?’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs19">But as for you, you have been thrown away without a burial place for you, like a detested sprout, clothed with killed men stabbed with the sword that are going down to the stones of a pit, like a carcass trodden down.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">You will not become united with them in a grave, because you brought your own land to ruin, you killed your own people. To time indefinite the offspring of evildoers will not be named.</span>

       <span id="vs27">For Jehovah of armies himself has counseled, and who can break [it] up? And his hand is the one stretched out, and who can turn it back?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In the year that King A&acute;haz died this pronouncement occurred:</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Do not rejoice, O Phi&middot;lis&acute;ti&middot;a, any one of you, just because the staff of the one striking you has been broken. For out of the root of the serpent there will come forth a poisonous snake, and its fruit will be a flying fiery snake.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And the firstborn ones of the lowly ones will certainly feed, and in security the poor ones themselves will lie down. And with famine I will put your root to death, and what remains over of you will be killed.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Howl, O gate! Cry out, O city! All of you must become disheartened, O Phi&middot;lis&acute;ti&middot;a! For out of the north a smoke is coming, and there is no one getting isolated from his ranks.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And what will anyone say in answer to the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah himself has laid the foundation of Zion, and in her the afflicted ones of his people will take refuge.</span>

       <span id="vs1">The pronouncement against Egypt: Look! Jehovah is riding on a swift cloud and coming into Egypt. And the valueless gods of Egypt will certainly quiver because of him, and the very heart of Egypt will melt in the midst of it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“And I will goad Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will certainly war each one against his brother, and each one against his companion, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the spirit of Egypt must become bewildered in the midst of it, and I shall confuse its own counsel. And they will be certain to resort to the valueless gods and to the charmers and to the spirit mediums and to the professional foretellers of events.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I will deliver up Egypt into the hand of a hard master, and strong will be the king that will rule over them,” is the utterance of the [true] Lord, Jehovah of armies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the water will certainly be dried up from the sea, and the river itself will become parched and actually run dry.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the rivers must stink; the Nile canals of Egypt must become low and parched. The reed and the rush themselves must molder.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The bare places by the Nile River, at the mouth of the Nile River, and every seedland of the Nile River will dry up. It will certainly be driven away, and it will be no more.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the fishers will have to mourn, and all those casting fishhooks into the Nile River must express sorrow, and even those spreading fishing nets upon the surface of the water will actually fade away.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the workers in carded flax must become ashamed; also the loom workers on white fabrics.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And her weavers must become crushed, all the wage workers grieved in soul.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The princes of Zo&acute;an are indeed foolish. As regards the wise ones of Phar&acute;aoh’s counselors, [their] counsel is something unreasonable. How will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men say to Phar&acute;aoh: “I am the son of wise ones, the son of kings of ancient time”?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Where, then, are they—the wise men of yours—that they may now tell you and that they may know what Jehovah of armies has counseled concerning Egypt?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">The princes of Zo&acute;an have acted foolishly, the princes of Noph have been deceived, the keymen of her tribes have caused Egypt to wander about.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Jehovah himself has mingled in the midst of her the spirit of disconcertedness; and they have caused Egypt to wander about in all its work, just as someone drunk is made to wander about in his vomit.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Egypt will not come to have any work that the head or the tail, the shoot or the rush, can do.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In that day Egypt will become like women, and it will certainly tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of Jehovah of armies which he is waving against it.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the ground of Judah must become to Egypt a cause for reeling. Everybody to whom one mentions it is in dread because of the counsel of Jehovah of armies that he is counseling against him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In that day there will prove to be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Ca&acute;naan and swearing to Jehovah of armies. The City of Tearing Down will one [city] be called.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In that day there will prove to be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah beside its boundary.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And it must prove to be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry out to Jehovah because of the oppressors, and he will send them a savior, even a grand one, who will actually deliver them.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah will certainly become known to the Egyptians; and the Egyptians must know Jehovah in that day, and they must render sacrifice and gift and must make a vow to Jehovah and pay it.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jehovah will certainly deal Egypt a blow. There will be a dealing of a blow and a healing; and they must return to Jehovah, and he must let himself be entreated by them and must heal them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In that day there will come to be a highway out of Egypt to As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, and As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a will actually come into Egypt, and Egypt into As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a; and they will certainly render service, Egypt with As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In that day Israel will come to be the third with Egypt and with As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, namely, a blessing in the midst of the earth,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">because Jehovah of armies will have blessed it, saying: “Blessed be my people, Egypt, and the work of my hands, As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, and my inheritance, Israel.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">The pronouncement of the valley of the vision: What is the matter with you, then, that you have gone up in your entirety to the roofs?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">With turmoil you were full, a boisterous city, an exultant town. Your slain ones are not those slain with the sword, nor those dead in battle.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">All your dictators themselves have fled at one time. Without [need of] a bow they have been taken prisoner. All those of you who have been found have been taken prisoner together. Far off they had run away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">That is why I have said: “Turn <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> gaze away from me. I will show bitterness in weeping. Do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people insist on comforting me over the despoiling of the daughter of my people.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For it is the day of confusion and of downtreading and of confounding that the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has in the valley of the vision. There is the demolisher of the wall, and the cry to the mountain.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And E&acute;lam itself has taken up the quiver, in the war chariot of earthling man, [with] steeds; and Kir itself has uncovered the shield.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And it will occur that the choicest of your low plains must become full of war chariots, and the very steeds must without fail set themselves in position at the gate,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and one will remove the screen of Judah. And you will look in that day toward the armory of the house of the forest,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will certainly see the very breaches of the City of David, for they will actually be many. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will collect the waters of the lower pool.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the houses of Jerusalem <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will actually count. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will also pull down the houses to make the wall unattainable.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And there will be a collecting basin that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must make between the two walls for the waters of the old pool. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly not look at the grand maker of it, and the one forming it long ago <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly not see.</span>

       <span id="vs13">But, look! exultation and rejoicing, the killing of cattle and the slaughtering of sheep, the eating of flesh and the drinking of wine, ‘Let there be eating and drinking, for tomorrow we shall die.’”</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And in my ears Jehovah of armies has revealed himself: “‘This error will not be atoned for in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> behalf until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people die,’ the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has said.”</span>

       <span id="vs16">‘What is there of interest to you here, and who is there of interest to you here, that you have hewed out for yourself here a burial place?’ On a height he is hewing out his burial place; in a crag he is cutting out a residence for himself.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">‘Look! Jehovah is hurling you down with violent hurling, O able-bodied man, and grasping you forcibly.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Without fail he will wrap you up tightly, like a ball for a wide land. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be the dishonor of the house of your master.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I will push you away from your position; and from your official standing one will tear you down.</span>

       <span id="vs22">And I will put the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he must open without anyone’s shutting, and he must shut without anyone’s opening.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And I will drive him in as a peg in a lasting place, and he must become as a throne of glory to the house of his father.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they must hang upon him all the glory of the house of his father, the descendants and the offshoots, all the vessels of the small sort, the vessels of the bowl sort as well as all the vessels of the large jars.</span>

       <span id="vs2">Be silent, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabitants of the coastland. The merchants from Si&acute;don, the ones crossing over the sea—they have filled you.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And on many waters has been the seed of Shi&acute;hor, the harvest of the Nile, her revenue; and it came to be the profit of the nations.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Be ashamed, O Si&acute;don; because the sea, O you stronghold of the sea, has said: “I have not had birth pains, and I have not given birth, nor have I brought up young men, raised up virgins.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Just as at the report pertaining to Egypt, people will likewise be in severe pains at the report on Tyre.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs9">Therefore by this means the error of Jacob will be atoned for, and this is all the fruit [when] he takes away his sin, when he makes all the stones of the altar like chalkstones that have been pulverized, so that the sacred poles and the incense stands will not rise up.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For the fortified city will be solitary, the pasture ground will be left to itself and abandoned like a wilderness. There the calf will graze, and there it will lie down; and he will actually consume her boughs.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">When her sprigs have dried up, women coming in will break [them] off, lighting them up. For it is not a people of keen understanding. That is why its Maker will show it no mercy, and its own Former will show it no favor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And it must occur in that day that Jehovah will beat off [the fruit], from the flowing stream of the River to the torrent valley of Egypt, and so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will be picked up one after the other, O sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it must occur in that day that there will be a blowing on a great horn, and those who are perishing in the land of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a and those who are dispersed in the land of Egypt will certainly come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Woe to the eminent crown of the drunkards of E&acute;phra&middot;im, and the fading blossom of its decoration of beauty that is upon the head of the fertile valley of those overpowered by wine!</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Look! Jehovah has someone strong and vigorous. Like a thunderous storm of hail, a destructive storm, like a thunderous storm of powerful, flooding waters, he will certainly do a casting down to the earth with force.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">With the feet the eminent crowns of the drunkards of E&acute;phra&middot;im will be trampled down.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the fading flower of its decoration of beauty that is upon the head of the fertile valley must become like the early fig before summer, that, when the seer sees it, while it is yet in his palm, he swallows it down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In that day Jehovah of armies will become as a crown of decoration and as a garland of beauty to the ones remaining over of his people,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and as a spirit of justice to the one sitting in the judgment, and as mightiness [to] those turning away the battle from the gate.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And these also—because of wine they have gone astray and because of intoxicating liquor they have wandered about. Priest and prophet—they have gone astray because of intoxicating liquor, they have become confused as a result of the wine, they have wandered about as a result of the intoxicating liquor; they have gone astray in their seeing, they have reeled as to decision.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For the tables themselves have all become full of filthy vomit—there is no place [without it].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Whom will one instruct in knowledge, and whom will one make understand what has been heard? Those who have been weaned from the milk, those moved away from the breasts?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For it is “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, here a little, there a little.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For by those stammering with their lips and by a different tongue he will speak to this people,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">those to whom he has said: “This is the resting-place. G<span class="smallcaps">IVE</span> rest to the weary one. And this is the place of ease,” but who were not willing to hear.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And to them the word of Jehovah will certainly become “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, here a little, there a little,” in order that they may go and certainly stumble backwards and actually be broken and ensnared and caught.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> braggarts, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rulers of this people who are in Jerusalem:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men have said: “We have concluded a covenant with Death; and with She&acute;ol we have effected a vision; the overflowing flash flood, in case it should pass through, will not come to us, for we have made a lie our refuge and in falsehood we have concealed ourselves”;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, the precious corner of a sure foundation. No one exercising faith will get panicky.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the leveling instrument; and the hail must sweep away the refuge of a lie, and the waters themselves will flood out the very place of concealment.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> covenant with Death will certainly be dissolved, and that vision of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> with She&acute;ol will not stand. The overflowing flash flood, when it passes through—<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must also become for it a trampling place.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As often as it passes through, it will take <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men away, because morning by morning it will pass through, during the day and during the night; and it must become nothing but a reason for quaking to make [others] understand what has been heard.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For the couch has proved too short for stretching oneself on, and the woven sheet itself is [too] narrow when wrapping oneself up.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For Jehovah will rise up just as at Mount Pe&middot;ra&acute;zim, he will be agitated just as in the low plain near Gib&acute;e&middot;on, that he may do his deed—his deed is strange—and that he may work his work—his work is unusual.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And now do not show yourselves scoffers, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bands may not grow strong, for there is an extermination, even something decided upon, that I have heard of from the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, for all the land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Give ear, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, and listen to my voice; pay attention and listen to my saying.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Is it all day long that the plower plows in order to sow seed, that he loosens and harrows his ground?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Does he not, when he has smoothed out its surface, then scatter black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, and must he not put in wheat, millet, and barley in the appointed place, and spelt as his boundary?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And one corrects him according to what is right. His own God instructs him.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For it is not with a threshing instrument that black cumin is given a treading; and upon cumin no wheel of a wagon is turned. For it is with a rod that black cumin is generally beaten out, and cumin with a staff.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Is breadstuff itself generally crushed? For never does one incessantly keep treading it out. And he must set the roller of his wagon in motion, and his own steeds, [but] he will not crush it.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">This also is what has come forth from Jehovah of armies himself, who has been wonderful in counsel, who has done greatly in effectual working.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And I have to make things tight for Ar&acute;i&middot;el, and there must come to be mourning and lamentation, and she must become to me as the altar hearth of God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And I must encamp on all sides against you, and I must lay siege to you with a palisade and raise up against you siegeworks.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you must become low so that you will speak from the very earth, and as from the dust your saying will sound low. And like a spirit medium your voice must become even from the earth, and from the dust your own saying will chirp.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the crowd of those strange to you must become just like fine powder, and the crowd of the tyrants just like the chaff that is passing away. And it must occur in an instant, suddenly.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">From Jehovah of armies you will have attention with thunder and with quaking and with a great sound, storm wind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And it must occur just as in a dream, in a vision of the night, regarding the crowd of all the nations that are waging war against Ar&acute;i&middot;el, even all those waging war against her, and the siege towers against her and those making things tight for her.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Yes, it must occur just as when someone hungry dreams and here he is eating, and he actually awakes and his soul is empty; and just as when someone thirsty dreams and here he is drinking, and he actually awakes and here he is tired and his soul is dried out; thus it will occur with the crowd of all the nations that are waging war against Mount Zion.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Linger, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, and be amazed; blind yourselves, and be blinded. They have become intoxicated, but not with wine; they have moved unsteadily, but not because of intoxicating liquor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men Jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep; and he closes <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes, the prophets, and he has covered even <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads, the visionaries.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men the vision of everything becomes like the words of the book that has been sealed up, which they give to someone knowing the writing, saying: “Read this out loud, please,” and he has to say: “I am unable, for it is sealed up”;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and the book must be given to someone that does not know writing, [somebody] saying: “Read this out loud, please,” and he has to say: “I do not know writing at all.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jehovah says: “For the reason that this people have come near with their mouth, and they have glorified me merely with their lips, and they have removed their heart itself far away from me, and their fear toward me becomes men’s commandment that is being taught,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">therefore here I am, the One that will act wonderfully again with this people, in a wonderful manner and with something wonderful; and the wisdom of their wise men must perish, and the very understanding of their discreet men will conceal itself.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Woe to those who are going very deep in concealing counsel from Jehovah himself, and whose deeds have occurred in a dark place, while they say: “Who is seeing us, and who is knowing of us?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The perversity of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men! Should the potter himself be accounted just like the clay? For should the thing made say respecting its maker: “He did not make me”? And does the very thing formed actually say respecting its former: “He showed no understanding”?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Is it not yet but a very little time and Leb&acute;a&middot;non must be turned into an orchard and the orchard itself will be accounted just as a forest?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And in that day the deaf ones will certainly hear the words of the book, and out of the gloom and out of the darkness even the eyes of the blind ones will see.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the meek ones will certainly increase their rejoicing in Jehovah himself, and even the poor ones of mankind will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel himself,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">because the tyrant must reach his end, and the bragger must come to his finish, and all those keeping alert to do harm must be cut off,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">those bringing a man into sin by [his] word, and those who lay bait even for the one reproving in the gate, and those who push aside the righteous one with empty arguments.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said to the house of Jacob, he that redeemed Abraham: “Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will his own face now grow pale;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">for when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name, and they will certainly sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel they will regard with awe.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And those who are erring in [their] spirit will actually get to know understanding, and even those who are grumbling will learn instruction.”</span>

<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">“Woe to the stubborn sons,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “[those disposed] to carry out counsel, but not that from me; and to pour out a libation, but not with my spirit, in order to add sin to sin;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">those who are setting out to go down to Egypt and who have not inquired of my own mouth, to take shelter in the stronghold of Phar&acute;aoh and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the stronghold of Phar&acute;aoh must become even for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men a reason for shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt a cause for humiliation.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For his princes have come to be in Zo&acute;an itself, and his own envoys reach even Ha&acute;nes.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Every one will certainly become ashamed of a people that bring no benefit to one, that are of no help and bring no benefit, but are a reason for shame and also a cause for reproach.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The pronouncement against the beasts of the south: Through the land of distress and hard conditions, of the lion and the leopard growling, of the viper and the flying fiery snake, on the shoulders of full-grown asses they carry their resources, and on the humps of camels their supplies. In behalf of the people they will prove of no benefit.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the Egyptians are mere vanity, and they will help simply for nothing. Therefore I have called this one: “Ra&acute;hab—they are for sitting still.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Now come, write it upon a tablet with them, and inscribe it even in a book, that it may serve for a future day, for a witness to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For it is a rebellious people, untruthful sons, sons who have been unwilling to hear the law of Jehovah;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">who have said to the ones seeing, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not see,’ and to the ones having visions, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not envision for us any straightforward things. Speak to us smooth things; envision deceptive things.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Turn aside from the way; deviate from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease just on account of us.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel has said: “In view of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> rejecting of this word, and [since] <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men trust in defrauding and in what is devious and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> support yourselves on it,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">therefore for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> this error will become like a broken section about to fall down, a swelling out in a highly raised wall, the breakdown of which may come suddenly, in an instant.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And one will certainly break it as in the breaking of a large jar of the potters, crushed to pieces without one’s sparing [it], so that there cannot be found among its crushed pieces a fragment of earthenware with which to rake the fire from the fireplace or to skim water from a marshy place.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By coming back and resting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will be saved. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> mightiness will prove to be simply in keeping undisturbed and in trustfulness.” But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were not willing.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> proceeded to say: “No, but on horses we shall flee!” That is why <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will flee. “And on swift [horses] we shall ride!” That is why those pursuing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will show themselves swift.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">A thousand will tremble on account of the rebuke of one; on account of the rebuke of five <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will flee until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have remained over like a mast on the top of a mountain and like a signal on a hill.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And therefore Jehovah will keep in expectation of showing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> favor, and therefore he will rise up to show <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> mercy. For Jehovah is a God of judgment. Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When the very people in Zion will dwell in Jerusalem, you will by no means weep. He will without fail show you favor at the sound of your outcry; as soon as he hears it he will actually answer you.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jehovah will certainly give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people bread in the form of distress and water in the form of oppression; yet your Grand Instructor will no longer hide himself, and your eyes must become [eyes] seeing your Grand Instructor.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: “This is the way. Walk in it, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people,” in case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people should go to the right or in case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should go to the left.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people must defile the overlaying of your graven images of silver and the close-fitting covering of your molten statue of gold. You will scatter them. Like a menstruating woman, you will say to it: “Mere dirt!”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he will certainly give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, and as the produce of the ground bread, which must become fat and oily. Your livestock will graze in that day in a spacious pasture.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the cattle and the full-grown asses cultivating the ground will eat fodder seasoned with sorrel, which was winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And upon every high mountain and upon every elevated hill there must come to be streams, water ditches, in the day of the big slaughter when the towers fall.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And the light of the full moon must become as the light of the glowing [sun]; and the very light of the glowing [sun] will become seven times as much, like the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breakdown of his people and heals even the severe wound resulting from the stroke by him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Look! The name of Jehovah is coming from far away, burning with his anger and with heavy clouds. As for his lips, they have become full of denunciation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And his spirit is like a flooding torrent that reaches clear to the neck, to swing the nations to and fro with a sieve of worthlessness; and a bridle that causes one to wander about will be in the jaws of the peoples.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> people will come to have a song like that in the night that one sanctifies oneself for a festival, and rejoicing of heart like that of one walking with a flute to enter into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And Jehovah will certainly make the dignity of his voice to be heard and will make the descending of his arm to be seen, in the raging of anger and the flame of a devouring fire [and] cloudburst and rainstorm and hailstones.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">For because of the voice of Jehovah As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a will be struck with terror; he will strike [it] even with a staff.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And every swing of his rod of chastisement that Jehovah will cause to settle down upon [As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a] will certainly prove to be with tambourines and with harps; and with battles of brandishing he will actually fight against them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">For his To&acute;pheth is set in order from recent times; it is also prepared for the king himself. He has made its pile deep. Fire and wood are in abundance. The breath of Jehovah, like a torrent of sulphur, is burning against it.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he is also wise and will bring in what is calamitous, and he has not called back his own words; and he will certainly rise up against the house of evildoers and against the assistance of those practicing what is hurtful.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And each one must prove to be like a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a waterless country, like the shadow of a heavy crag in an exhausted land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs4">And the heart itself of those who are overhasty will consider knowledge, and even the tongue of the stammerers will be quick in speaking clear things.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The senseless one will no longer be called generous; and as for the unprincipled man, he will not be said to be noble;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">because the senseless one himself will speak mere senselessness, and his very heart will work at what is hurtful, to work at apostasy and to speak against Jehovah what is wayward, to cause the soul of the hungry one to go empty, and he causes even the thirsty one to go without drink itself.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As for the unprincipled man, his instruments are bad; he himself has given counsel for acts of loose conduct, to wreck the afflicted ones with false sayings, even when someone poor speaks what is right.</span>

       <span id="vs12">Beat yourselves upon the breasts in lamentation over the desirable fields, over the fruit-bearing vine.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs14">For the dwelling tower itself has been forsaken, the very hubbub of the city has been abandoned; O&acute;phel and the watchtower themselves have become bare fields, for time indefinite the exultation of zebras, the pasture of droves;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">until upon us the spirit is poured out from on high, and the wilderness will have become an orchard, and the orchard itself is accounted as a real forest.</span>

       <span id="vs17">And the work of the [true] righteousness must become peace; and the service of the [true] righteousness, quietness and security to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And my people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting-places.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And it will certainly hail when the forest goes down and the city becomes low in an abased state.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Woe to you who are despoiling, without you yourself being despoiled, and to you who are dealing treacherously, without [others] having dealt treacherously with you! As soon as you have finished as a despoiler, you will be despoiled. As soon as you have done with dealing treacherously, they will deal treacherously with you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">O Jehovah, show us favor. In you we have hoped. Become our arm every morning, yes, our salvation in the time of distress.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At the sound of turmoil peoples have fled. At your arising nations have been dispersed.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the spoil of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will actually be gathered [like] the cockroaches when gathering in, like the onrush of locust swarms that is rushing against one.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Jehovah will certainly be put on high, for he is residing in the height. He must fill Zion with justice and righteousness.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the trustworthiness of your times must prove to be a wealth of salvations—wisdom and knowledge, the fear of Jehovah, which is his treasure.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Look! Their very heroes have cried out in the street; the very messengers of peace will weep bitterly.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The highways have been made desolate; the one passing over the path has ceased. He has broken the covenant; he has contemned the cities; he has taken no account of mortal man.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The land has gone mourning, has withered away. Leb&acute;a&middot;non has become abashed; it has moldered. Shar&acute;on has become like the desert plain; and Ba&acute;shan and Car&acute;mel are shaking off [their leaves].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Now I will rise up,” says Jehovah, “now I will exalt myself; now I will lift myself up.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs14">In Zion the sinners have come to be in dread; shivering has grabbed hold of the apostates: ‘Who of us can reside for any time with a devouring fire? Who of us can reside for any time with long-lasting conflagrations?’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“There is one who is walking in continual righteousness and speaking what is upright, who is rejecting the unjust gain from frauds, who is shaking his hands clear from taking hold on a bribe, who is stopping up his ear from listening to bloodshed, and who is closing his eyes so as not to see what is bad.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">He is the one that will reside on the heights themselves; his secure height will be craggy places difficult to approach. His own bread will certainly be given [him]; his water supply will be unfailing.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">A king in his handsomeness is what your eyes will behold; they will see a land far away.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Your own heart will comment in low tones on a frightful thing: “Where is the secretary? Where is the one that does the paying out? Where is the one counting the towers?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">No insolent people will you see, a people too deep in language to listen to, of a stammering tongue without [your] understanding.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Behold Zion, the town of our festal occasions! Your own eyes will see Jerusalem an undisturbed abiding place, a tent that no one will pack up. Never will its tent pins be pulled out, and none of its ropes will be torn in two.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But there the Majestic One, Jehovah, will be for us a place of rivers, of wide canals. On it no galley fleet will go, and no majestic ship will pass over it.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King; he himself will save us.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>

</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs23-2">At that time even spoil in abundance will have to be divided up; the lame ones themselves will actually take a big plunder.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And no resident will say: “I am sick.” The people that are dwelling in [the land] will be those pardoned for their error.</span>

       <span id="vs2">For Jehovah has indignation against all the nations, and rage against all their army. He must devote them to destruction; he must give them to the slaughter.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And their slain ones will be thrown out; and as for their carcasses, their stink will ascend; and the mountains must melt because of their blood.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And all those of the army of the heavens must rot away. And the heavens must be rolled up, just like a book scroll; and their army will all shrivel away, just as the leafage shrivels off the vine and like a shriveled [fig] off the fig tree.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah that Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a finally sent Rab&acute;sha&middot;keh from La&acute;chish to Jerusalem, to King Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, with a heavy military force, and he proceeded to stand still by the conduit of the upper pool at the highway of the laundryman’s field.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then there came out to him E&middot;li&acute;a&middot;kim the son of Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah, who was over the household, and Sheb&acute;na the secretary and Jo&acute;ah the son of A&acute;saph the recorder.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Accordingly Rab&acute;sha&middot;keh said to them: “Please, say to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, has said: “What is this confidence in which you have trusted?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">You have said (but it is the word of lips), ‘There are counsel and mightiness for the war.’ Now in whom have you put trust, that you have rebelled against me?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Look! You have trusted in the support of this crushed reed, in Egypt, which, if a man should brace himself upon it, would certainly enter into his palm and pierce it. That is the way Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt is to all those putting their trust in him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And in case you should say to me, ‘It is Jehovah our God in whom we have trusted,’ is he not the one whose high places and whose altars Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah has removed, while he says to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Before this altar <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should bow down’?”’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now, then, make a wager, please, with my lord the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, and let me give you two thousand horses [to see] whether you are able, on your part, to put riders upon them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">How, then, could you turn back the face of one governor of the smallest servants of my lord, while you, for your part, put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this land to bring it to ruin? Jehovah himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and you must bring it to ruin.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At this E&middot;li&acute;a&middot;kim and Sheb&acute;na and Jo&acute;ah said to Rab&acute;sha&middot;keh: “Speak, please, to your servants in the Syrian language, for we are listening; and do not speak to us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But Rab&acute;sha&middot;keh said: “Is it to your lord and to you that my lord has sent me to speak these words? Is it not to the men sitting upon the wall, that they may eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Rab&acute;sha&middot;keh continued to stand and call out in a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and he went on to say: “H<span class="smallcaps">EAR</span> the words of the great king, the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">This is what the king has said, ‘Do not let Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah deceive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, for he is not able to deliver <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And do not let Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah cause <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to trust in Jehovah, saying: “Without fail Jehovah will deliver us.

       <span id="vs16">Do not listen to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, for this is what the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a has said: “Make a capitulation to me and come out to me and eat each one from his own vine and each one from his own fig tree and drink each one the water of his own cistern,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">until I come and actually take <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to a land like <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">in order that Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah may not allure <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘Jehovah himself will deliver us.’ Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Where are the gods of Ha&acute;math and Ar&acute;pad? Where are the gods of Seph&middot;ar&middot;va&acute;im? And have they delivered Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a out of my hand?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

There proved to be nothing that Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah and said to him: “What did these men say, and from where did they proceed to come to you?” So Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said: “From a distant land they came to me, from Babylon.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he went on to say: “What did they see in your house?” To this Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said: “Everything that is in my house they saw. There proved to be nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Isaiah now said to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah: “Hear the word of Jehovah of armies,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">‘Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon.’ ‘Nothing will be left,’ Jehovah has said.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">‘And some of your own sons that will come forth from you, to whom you will become father, will themselves be taken and actually become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said to Isaiah: “The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good.” And he went on to say: “Because peace and truth will continue in my own days.”</span>

       <span id="vs3">No crushed reed will he break; and as for a dim flaxen wick, he will not extinguish it. In trueness he will bring forth justice.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">He will not grow dim nor be crushed until he sets justice in the earth itself; and for his law the islands themselves will keep waiting.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">This is what the [true] God, Jehovah, has said, the Creator of the heavens and the Grand One stretching them out; the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“I myself, Jehovah, have called you in righteousness, and I proceeded to take hold of your hand. And I shall safeguard you and give you as a covenant of the people, as a light of the nations,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">[for you] to open the blind eyes, to bring forth out of the dungeon the prisoner, out of the house of detention those sitting in darkness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs9">“The first things—here they have come, but new things I am telling out. Before they begin to spring up, I cause <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people to hear [them].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise from the extremity of the earth, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men that are going down to the sea and to that which fills it, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> islands and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabiting them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Let the wilderness and its cities raise [their voice], the settlements that Ke&acute;dar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of the crag cry out in joy. From the top of the mountains let people cry aloud.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Let them attribute to Jehovah glory, and in the islands let them tell forth even his praise.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Like a mighty man Jehovah himself will go forth. Like a warrior he will awaken zeal. He will shout, yes, he will let out a war cry; over his enemies he will show himself mightier.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“I have kept quiet for a long time. I continued silent. I kept exercising self-control. Like a woman giving birth I am going to groan, pant, and gasp at the same time.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">I shall devastate mountains and hills, and all their vegetation I shall dry up. And I will turn rivers into islands, and reedy pools I shall dry up.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I will make the blind ones walk in a way that they have not known; in a roadway that they have not known I shall cause them to tread. I shall turn a dark place before them into light, and rugged terrain into level land. These are the things that I will do for them, and I will not leave them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They must be turned back, they will be very much ashamed, those who are putting trust in the carved image, those who are saying to a molten image: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are our gods.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Hear, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> deaf ones; and look forth to see, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> blind ones.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Who is blind, if not my servant, and who is deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as the one rewarded, or blind as the servant of Jehovah?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">It was a case of seeing many things, but you did not keep watching. It was a case of opening the ears, but you did not keep listening.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jehovah himself for the sake of his righteousness has taken a delight in that he should magnify the law and make it majestic.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But it is a people plundered and pillaged, all of them being trapped in the holes, and in the houses of detention they have been kept hidden. They have come to be for plunder without a deliverer, for pillage without anyone to say: “Bring back!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Who among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will give ear to this? Who will pay attention and listen for later times?</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Who has given Jacob for mere pillage, and Israel to the plunderers? Is it not Jehovah, the One against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they did not want to walk and to whose law they did not listen?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So He kept pouring out upon him rage, his anger, and the strength of war. And it kept consuming him all around, but he took no note; and it kept blazing up against him, but he would lay nothing to heart.</span>

       <span id="vs2">This is what Jehovah has said, your Maker and your Former, who kept helping you even from the belly, ‘Do not be afraid, O my servant Jacob, and you, Jesh&acute;u&middot;run, whom I have chosen.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For I shall pour out water upon the thirsty one, and trickling streams upon the dry place. I shall pour out my spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon your descendants.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And they will certainly spring up as among the green grass, like poplars by the water ditches.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">This one will say: “I belong to Jehovah.” And that one will call [himself] by the name of Jacob, and another will write upon his hand: “Belonging to Jehovah.” And by the name of Israel one will betitle [himself].’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“This is what Jehovah has said, the King of Israel and the Repurchaser of him, Jehovah of armies, ‘I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And who is there like me? Let him call out, that he may tell it and present it to me. From when I appointed the people of long ago, both the things coming and the things that will enter in let them tell on their part.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Do not be in dread, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and do not become stupefied. Have I not from that time on caused you individually to hear and told [it] out? And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are my witnesses. Does there exist a God besides me? No, there is no Rock. I have recognized none.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The formers of the carved image are all of them an unreality, and their darlings themselves will be of no benefit; and as their witnesses they see nothing and know nothing, in order that they may be ashamed.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Who has formed a god or cast a mere molten image? Of no benefit at all has it been.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Look! All his partners themselves will be ashamed, and the craftsmen are from earthling men. They will all of them collect themselves together. They will stand still. They will be in dread. They will be ashamed at the same time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for the carver of iron with the billhook, he has been busy [at it] with the coals; and with the hammers he proceeds to form it, and he keeps busy at it with his powerful arm. Also, he has become hungry, and so without power. He has not drunk water; so he gets tired.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">As for the wood carver, he has stretched out the measuring line; he traces it out with red chalk; he works it up with a wood scraper; and with a compass he keeps tracing it out, and gradually he makes it like the representation of a man, like the beauty of mankind, to sit in a house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">There is one whose business is to cut down cedars; and he takes a certain species of tree, even a massive tree, and he lets it become strong for himself among the trees of the forest. He planted the laurel tree, and the pouring rain itself keeps making it get big.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it has become [something] for man to keep a fire burning. So he takes part of it that he may warm himself. In fact he builds a fire and actually bakes bread. He also works on a god to which he may bow down. He has made it into a carved image, and he prostrates himself to it.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Half of it he actually burns up in a fire. Upon half of it he roasts well the flesh that he eats, and he becomes satisfied. He also warms himself and says: “Aha! I have warmed myself. I have seen the firelight.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But the remainder of it he actually makes into a god itself, into his carved image. He prostrates himself to it and bows down and prays to it and says: “Deliver me, for you are my god.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">They have not come to know, nor do they understand, because their eyes have been besmeared so as not to see, their heart so as to have no insight.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And no one recalls to his heart or has knowledge or understanding, saying: “The half of it I have burned up in a fire, and upon its coals I have also baked bread; I roast flesh and eat. But the rest of it shall I make into a mere detestable thing? To the dried-out wood of a tree shall I prostrate myself?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">He is feeding on ashes. His own heart that has been trifled with has led him astray. And he does not deliver his soul, nor does he say: “Is there not a falsehood in my right hand?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Remember these things, O Jacob, and you, O Israel, because you are my servant. I have formed you. You are a servant belonging to me. O Israel, you will not be forgotten on my part.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">I will wipe out your transgressions just as with a cloud, and your sins just as with a cloud mass. Do return to me, for I will repurchase you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“Joyfully cry out, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heavens, for Jehovah has taken action! Shout in triumph, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> lowest parts of the earth! Become cheerful, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> mountains, with joyful outcry, you forest and all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> trees in it! For Jehovah has repurchased Jacob, and on Israel he shows his beauty.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">This is what Jehovah has said, your Repurchaser and the Former of you from the belly: “I, Jehovah, am doing everything, stretching out the heavens by myself, laying out the earth. Who was with me?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">[I am] frustrating the signs of the empty talkers, and [I am] the One that makes diviners themselves act crazily; the One turning wise men backwards, and the One that turns even their knowledge into foolishness;</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">the One making the word of his servant come true, and the One that carries out completely the counsel of his own messengers; the One saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’ and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt, and her desolated places I shall raise up’;</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">the One saying to the watery deep, ‘Be evaporated; and all your rivers I shall dry up’;</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in [my] saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’”</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Before you I myself shall go, and the swells of land I shall straighten out. The copper doors I shall break in pieces, and the iron bars I shall cut down.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And I will give you the treasures in the darkness and the hidden treasures in the concealment places, in order that you may know that I am Jehovah, the One calling [you] by your name, the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs1">Come down and sit down in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit down on the earth where there is no throne, O daughter of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans. For you will not experience again that people call you delicate and dainty.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Take a hand mill and grind out flour. Uncover your veil. Strip off the flowing skirt. Uncover the leg. Cross over the rivers.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs6">I grew indignant at my people. I profaned my inheritance, and I proceeded to give them into your hand. You showed them no mercies. Upon the old man you made your yoke very heavy.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And you kept saying: “To time indefinite I shall prove to be Mistress, forever.” You did not take these things to your heart; you did not remember the finale of the matter.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And now hear this, you pleasure-given [woman], the one sitting in security, the one saying in her heart: “I am, and there is nobody else. I shall not sit as a widow, and I shall not know the loss of children.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But to you these two things will come suddenly, in one day: loss of children and widowhood. In their complete measure they must come upon you, for the abundance of your sorceries, for the full might of your spells—exceedingly.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And you kept trusting in your badness. You have said: “There is no one seeing me.” Your wisdom and your knowledge—this is what has led you away; and you keep saying in your heart: “I am, and there is nobody else.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And upon you calamity must come; you will know no charming against it. And upon you adversity will fall; you will not be able to avert it. And upon you there will suddenly come a ruin that you are not accustomed to know.</span>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>

       <span id="vs13">You have grown weary with the multitude of your counselors.

       <span id="vs14">Look! They have become like stubble. A fire itself will certainly burn them up. They will not deliver their soul from the power of the flame. There will be no glow of charcoals for people to warm themselves, no firelight in front of which to sit down.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Thus they will certainly become to you, with whom you have toiled as your charmers from your youth. They will actually wander, each one to his own region. There will be no one to save you.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Listen to me, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> islands, and pay attention, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> national groups far away. Jehovah himself has called me even from the belly. From the inward parts of my mother he has made mention of my name.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to make my mouth like a sharp sword. In the shadow of his hand he has hidden me. And he gradually made me a polished arrow. He concealed me in his own quiver.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he went on to say to me: “You are my servant, O Israel, you the one in whom I shall show my beauty.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But as for me, I said: “It is for nothing that I have toiled. For unreality and vanity I have used up my own power. Truly my judgment is with Jehovah, and my wages with my God.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And now Jehovah, the One forming me from the belly as a servant belonging to him, has said [for me] to bring back Jacob to him, in order that to him Israel itself may be gathered. And I shall be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah, and my own God will have become my strength.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he proceeded to say: “It has been more than a trivial matter for you to become my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back even the safeguarded ones of Israel; I also have given you for a light of the nations, that my salvation may come to be to the extremity of the earth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">This is what Jehovah, the Repurchaser of Israel, his Holy One, has said to him that is despised in soul, to him that is detested by the nation, to the servant of rulers: “Kings themselves will see and certainly rise up, [and] princes, and they will bow down, by reason of Jehovah, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who chooses you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">This is what Jehovah has said: “In a time of goodwill I have answered you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you; and I kept safeguarding you that I might give you as a covenant for the people, to rehabilitate the land, to bring about the repossessing of the desolated hereditary possessions,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’ to those who are in the darkness, ‘Reveal yourselves!’ By the ways they will pasture, and on all beaten paths their pasturing will be.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">They will not go hungry, neither will they go thirsty, nor will parching heat or sun strike them. For the One who is having pity upon them will lead them, and by the springs of water he will conduct them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways themselves will be on an elevation.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Look! These will come even from far away, and, look! these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Si&acute;nim.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Give a glad cry, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heavens, and be joyful, you earth. Let the mountains become cheerful with a glad outcry. For Jehovah has comforted his people, and he shows pity upon his own afflicted ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But Zion kept saying: “Jehovah has left me, and Jehovah himself has forgotten me.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly? Even these women can forget, yet I myself shall not forget you.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Look! Upon [my] palms I have engraved you. Your walls are in front of me constantly.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Your sons have hurried up. The very ones tearing you down and devastating you will go forth even from you.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Raise your eyes all around and see. They have all of them been collected together. They have come to you. “As I am living,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “with all of them you will clothe yourself just as with ornaments, and you will bind them on yourself like a bride.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Although there are your devastated places and your desolated places and the land of your ruins, although now you are too cramped to be dwelling, and those swallowing you down have been far away,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">yet in your own ears the sons of your bereaved state will say, ‘The place has become too cramped for me. Do make room for me, that I may dwell.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And you will for certain say in your heart, ‘Who has become father to these for me, since I am a woman bereaved of children and sterile, gone into exile and taken prisoner? As for these, who has brought [them] up? Look! I myself had been left behind alone. These—where have they been?’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Look! I shall raise up my hand even to the nations, and to the peoples I shall lift up my signal. And they will bring your sons in the bosom, and upon the shoulder they will carry your own daughters.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And kings must become caretakers for you, and their princesses nursing women for you. With faces to the earth they will bow down to you, and the dust of your feet they will lick up; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah, of whom those hoping in me will not be ashamed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Can those already taken be taken from a mighty man himself, or can the body of captives of the tyrant make their escape?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But this is what Jehovah has said: “Even the body of captives of the mighty man will be taken away, and those already taken by the tyrant himself will make their escape. And against anyone contending against you I myself shall contend, and your own sons I myself shall save.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And I will make those maltreating you eat their own flesh; and as with the sweet wine they will become drunk with their own blood. And all flesh will have to know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Repurchaser, the Powerful One of Jacob.”</span>

       <span id="vs4">“Pay attention to me, O my people; and you national group of mine, to me give ear. For from me a law itself will go forth, and my judicial decision I shall cause to repose even as a light to the peoples.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">My righteousness is near. My salvation will certainly go forth, and my own arms will judge even the peoples. In me the islands themselves will hope, and for my arm they will wait.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Raise <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes to the heavens themselves, and look at the earth beneath. For the very heavens must be dispersed in fragments just like smoke, and like a garment the earth itself will wear out, and its inhabitants themselves will die like a mere gnat. But as for my salvation, it will prove to be even to time indefinite, and my own righteousness will not be shattered.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Listen to me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the ones knowing righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law.

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Awake, awake, clothe yourself with strength, O arm of Jehovah! Awake as in the days of long ago, as during the generations of times long past. Are you not the one that broke Ra&acute;hab to pieces, that pierced the sea monster?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Are you not the one that dried up the sea, the waters of the vast deep? The one that made the depths of the sea a way for the repurchased ones to go across?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then the redeemed ones of Jehovah themselves will return and must come to Zion with a joyful outcry, and rejoicing to time indefinite will be upon their head. To exultation and rejoicing they will attain. Grief and sighing will certainly flee away.</span>

       <span id="vs12-2">“Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man that will die, and of a son of mankind that will be rendered as mere green grass?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth, so that you were in dread constantly the whole day long on account of the rage of the one hemming [you] in, as though he was all set to bring [you] to ruin? And where is the rage of the one hemming [you] in?</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“The one stooping in chains will certainly be loosened speedily, that he may not go in death to the pit and that his bread may not be lacking.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“But I, Jehovah, am your God, the One stirring up the sea that its waves may be boisterous. Jehovah of armies is his name.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I shall put my words in your mouth, and with the shadow of my hand I shall certainly cover you, in order to plant the heavens and lay the foundation of the earth and say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Rouse yourself, rouse yourself, rise up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk at the hand of Jehovah his cup of rage. The goblet, the cup causing reeling, you have drunk, you have drained out.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">There was none of all the sons that she brought to birth conducting her, and there was none of all the sons that she brought up taking hold of her hand.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Those two things were befalling you. Who will sympathize with you? Despoiling and breakdown, and hunger and sword! Who will comfort you?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Your own sons have swooned away. They have lain down at the head of all the streets like the wild sheep in the net, as those who are full of the rage of Jehovah, the rebuke of your God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Therefore listen to this, please, O woman afflicted and drunk, but not with wine.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">This is what your Lord, Jehovah, even your God, who contends for his people, has said: “Look! I will take away from your hand the cup causing reeling. The goblet, my cup of rage—you will not repeat the drinking of it anymore.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And I will put it in the hand of the ones irritating you, who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down that we may cross over,’ so that you used to make your back just like the earth, and like the street for those crossing over.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he will come up like a twig before one, and like a root out of waterless land. No stately form does he have, nor any splendor; and when we shall see him, there is not the appearance so that we should desire him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He was despised and was avoided by men, a man meant for pains and for having acquaintance with sickness. And there was as if the concealing of one’s face from us. He was despised, and we held him as of no account.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; and as for our pains, he bore them. But we ourselves accounted him as plagued, stricken by God and afflicted.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But he was being pierced for our transgression; he was being crushed for our errors. The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Like sheep we have all of us wandered about; it was each one to his own way that we have turned; and Jehovah himself has caused the error of us all to meet up with that one.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He was hard pressed, and he was letting himself be afflicted; yet he would not open his mouth. He was being brought just like a sheep to the slaughtering; and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth.</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

       <span id="vs11">Because of the trouble of his soul he will see, he will be satisfied. By means of his knowledge the righteous one, my servant, will bring a righteous standing to many people; and their errors he himself will bear.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For that reason I shall deal him a portion among the many, and it will be with the mighty ones that he will apportion the spoil, due to the fact that he poured out his soul to the very death, and it was with the transgressors that he was counted in; and he himself carried the very sin of many people, and for the transgressors he proceeded to interpose.</span>

       <span id="vs1">“Cry out joyfully, you barren woman that did not give birth! Become cheerful with a joyful outcry and cry shrilly, you that had no childbirth pains, for the sons of the desolated one are more numerous than the sons of the woman with a husbandly owner,” Jehovah has said.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Make the place of your tent more spacious. And let them stretch out the tent cloths of your grand tabernacle. Do not hold back. Lengthen out your tent cords, and make those tent pins of yours strong.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For to the right and to the left you will break forth, and your own offspring will take possession even of nations, and they will inhabit even the desolated cities.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame; and do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disappointed. For you will forget even the shame of your time of youth, and the reproach of your continuous widowhood you will remember no more.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“For your Grand Maker is your husbandly owner, Jehovah of armies being his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Repurchaser. The God of the whole earth he will be called.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For Jehovah called you as if you were a wife left entirely and hurt in spirit, and as a wife of the time of youth who was then rejected,” your God has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“For a little moment I left you entirely, but with great mercies I shall collect you together.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">With a flood of indignation I concealed my face from you for but a moment, but with loving-kindness to time indefinite I will have mercy upon you,” your Repurchaser, Jehovah, has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“This is just as the days of Noah to me. Just as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not become indignant toward you nor rebuke you.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For the mountains themselves may be removed, and the very hills may stagger, but my loving-kindness itself will not be removed from you, nor will my covenant of peace itself stagger,” Jehovah, the One having mercy upon you, has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“O woman afflicted, tempest-tossed, uncomforted, here I am laying with hard mortar your stones, and I will lay your foundation with sapphires.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I will make your battlements of rubies, and your gates of fiery glowing stones, and all your boundaries of delightsome stones.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And all your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">You will prove to be firmly established in righteousness itself. You will be far away from oppression—for you will fear none—and from anything terrifying, for it will not come near you.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">If anyone should at all make an attack, it will not be at my orders. Whoever is making an attack upon you will fall even on account of you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Look! I myself have created the craftsman, the one blowing upon the fire of charcoal and bringing forth a weapon as his workmanship. I myself, too, have created the ruinous man for wrecking work.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success, and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn. This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">The righteous one himself has perished, but there is no one taking [it] to heart. And men of loving-kindness are being gathered [to the dead], while no one discerns that it is because of the calamity that the righteous one has been gathered away.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">He enters into peace; they take rest upon their beds, [each] one that is walking straightforwardly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, come up close here, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sons of a soothsaying woman, the seed of an adulterous person and of a woman that commits prostitution:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Over whom is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have a jolly good time? Against whom do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep opening wide the mouth, keep sticking out the tongue? Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not the children of transgression, the seed of falsehood,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">those who are working up passion among big trees, under every luxuriant tree, slaughtering the children in the torrent valleys under the clefts of the crags?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“With the smooth stones of the torrent valley was your portion. They—they were your lot. Moreover, to them you poured out a drink offering, you offered up a gift. For these things shall I comfort myself?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Upon a mountain high and lifted up you set your bed. There also you went up to offer sacrifice.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And behind the door and the doorpost you set your memorial. For apart from me you uncovered [yourself] and proceeded to go up; you made your bed spacious. And for yourself you went concluding a covenant with them. You loved a bed with them. The male organ you beheld.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And you proceeded to descend toward Mel&acute;ech with oil, and kept making your ointments abundant. And you continued sending your envoys far off, so that you lowered matters to She&acute;ol.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In the multitude of your ways you have toiled. You have not said, ‘It is hopeless!’ You have found a revival of your own power. That is why you have not grown sick.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Whom did you become frightened at and begin to fear, so that you took up lying? But I was not the one that you remembered. You took nothing to your heart. Was I not keeping silent and hiding matters? So you were in no fear even of me.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I myself shall tell forth your righteousness and your works, that they will not benefit you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">When you cry for aid your collection of things will not deliver you, but a wind will carry even all of them away. An exhalation will take them away, but the one taking refuge in me will inherit the land and will take possession of my holy mountain.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And one will certainly say, ‘Bank up, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, bank up! Clear the way. Remove any obstacle from the way of my people.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For this is what the High and Lofty One, who is residing forever and whose name is holy, has said: “In the height and in the holy place is where I reside, also with the one crushed and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly ones and to revive the heart of the ones being crushed.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For it will not be to time indefinite that I shall contend, nor perpetually that I shall be indignant; for because of me the spirit itself would grow feeble, even the breathing creatures that I myself have made.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“At the erroneousness of his unjust gain I grew indignant, and I proceeded to strike him, concealing [my face], while I was indignant. But he kept walking as a renegade in the way of his heart.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I have seen his very ways; and I began to heal him and conduct him and make compensation with comfort to him and to his mourning ones.”</span>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“I am creating the fruit of the lips. Continuous peace there will be to the one that is far away and to the one that is near,” Jehovah has said, “and I will heal him.”</span>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“But the wicked are like the sea that is being tossed, when it is unable to calm down, the waters of which keep tossing up seaweed and mire.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>

       <span id="vs2">Yet day after day it was I whom they kept seeking, and it was in the knowledge of my ways that they would express delight, like a nation that carried on righteousness itself and that had not left the very justice of their God, in that they kept asking me for righteous judgments, drawing near to God in whom they had delight,</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“‘For what reason did we fast and you did not see, and did we afflict our soul and you would take no note?’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“Indeed <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people were finding delight in the very day of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fasting, when there were all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> toilers that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept driving to work.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Indeed for quarreling and struggle <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would fast, and for striking with the fist of wickedness. Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not keep fasting as in the day for making <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> voice to be heard in the height?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Should the fast that I choose become like this, as a day for earthling man to afflict his soul? For bowing down his head just like a rush, and that he should spread out mere sackcloth and ashes as his couch? Is it this that you call a fast and a day acceptable to Jehovah?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Is not this the fast that I choose? To loosen the fetters of wickedness, to release the bands of the yoke bar, and to send away the crushed ones free, and that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people should tear in two every yoke bar?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Is it not the dividing of your bread out to the hungry one, and that you should bring the afflicted, homeless people into [your] house? That, in case you should see someone naked, you must cover him, and that you should not hide yourself from your own flesh?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“In that case your light would break forth just like the dawn; and speedily would recuperation spring up for you. And before you your righteousness would certainly walk; the very glory of Jehovah would be your rear guard.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In that case you would call, and Jehovah himself would answer; you would cry for help, and he would say, ‘Here I am!’</span>

       <span id="vs10">and you will grant to the hungry one your own soul[ful desire], and you will satisfy the soul that is being afflicted, your light also will certainly flash up even in the darkness, and your gloom will be like midday.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah will be bound to lead you constantly and to satisfy your soul even in a scorched land, and he will invigorate your very bones; and you must become like a well-watered garden, and like the source of water, the waters of which do not lie.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And at your instance men will certainly build up the places devastated a long time; you will raise up even the foundations of continuous generations. And you will actually be called the repairer of [the] gap, the restorer of roadways by which to dwell.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“If in view of the sabbath you will turn back your foot as regards doing your own delights on my holy day, and will actually call the sabbath an exquisite delight, a holy [day] of Jehovah, one being glorified, and will actually glorify it rather than doing your own ways, rather than finding what delights you and speaking a word;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">you will in that case find your exquisite delight in Jehovah, and I will make you ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will cause you to eat from the hereditary possession of Jacob your forefather, for the mouth of Jehovah itself has spoken [it].”</span>

       <span id="vs2">No, but the very errors of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have become the things causing division between <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own sins have caused the concealing of [his] face from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to keep from hearing.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own palms have become polluted with blood, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fingers with error. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> own lips have spoken falsehood. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> own tongue kept muttering sheer unrighteousness.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">There is no one calling out in righteousness, and no one at all has gone to court in faithfulness. There has been a trusting in unreality, and a speaking of worthlessness. There has been a conceiving of trouble, and a bringing of what is hurtful to birth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The eggs of a poisonous snake are what they have hatched, and they kept weaving the mere cobweb of a spider. Anyone eating some of their eggs would die, and the [egg] that was smashed would be hatched into a viper.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Their mere cobweb will not serve as a garment, nor will they cover themselves with their works. Their works are hurtful works, and the activity of violence is in their palms.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Their own feet keep running to sheer badness, and they are in a hurry to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are hurtful thoughts; despoiling and breakdown are in their highways.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The way of peace they have ignored, and there is no justice in their tracks. Their roadways they have made crooked for themselves. No one at all treading in them will actually know peace.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">That is why justice has come to be far away from us, and righteousness does not catch up with us. We keep hoping for light, but, look! darkness; for brightness, [but] in continuous gloom we kept walking.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">We keep groping for the wall just like blind men, and like those without eyes we keep groping. We have stumbled at high noon just as in evening darkness; among the stout ones [we are] just like dead people.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">We keep groaning, all of us, just like bears; and like doves we mournfully keep cooing. We kept hoping for justice, but there was none; for salvation, [but] it has stayed far away from us.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For our revolts have become many in front of you; and as for our sins, each one has testified against us. For our revolts are with us; and as for our errors, we well know them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">There have been transgressing and a denying of Jehovah; and there was a moving back from our God, a speaking of oppression and revolt, a conceiving and a muttering of words of falsehood from the very heart.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And justice was forced to move back, and righteousness itself kept standing simply far off. For truth has stumbled even in the public square, and what is straightforward is unable to enter.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the truth proves to be missing, and anyone turning away from badness is being despoiled.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs15-2">And Jehovah got to see, and it was bad in his eyes that there was no justice.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And when he saw that there was no man, he began to show himself astonished that there was no one interposing. And his arm proceeded to save for him, and his own righteousness was the thing that supported him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and the helmet of salvation upon his head. Furthermore, he put on the garments of vengeance as raiment and enwrapped himself with zeal as if a sleeveless coat.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In accordance with the dealings he will reward correspondingly, rage to his adversaries, due treatment to his enemies. To the islands he will recompense due treatment.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And from the sunset they will begin to fear the name of Jehovah, and from the rising of the sun the glory of him, for he will come in like a distressing river, which the very spirit of Jehovah has driven along.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And to Zion the Repurchaser will certainly come, and to those turning from transgression in Jacob,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>

</p>

       <span id="vs3">“The wine trough I have trodden by myself, while there was no man with me from the peoples. And I kept treading them in my anger, and I kept trampling them down in my rage. And their spurting blood kept spattering upon my garments, and all my clothing I have polluted.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the very year of my repurchased ones has come.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I kept looking, but there was no helper; and I began to show myself astonished, but there was no one offering support. So my arm furnished me salvation, and my rage was what supported me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I kept stamping down peoples in my anger, and I proceeded to make them drunk with my rage and to bring down to the earth their spurting blood.”</span>

       <span id="vs7">The loving-kindnesses of Jehovah I shall mention, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has rendered to us, even the abundant goodness to the house of Israel that he has rendered to them according to his mercies and according to the abundance of his loving-kindnesses.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he went on to say: “Surely they are my people, sons that will not prove false.” So it was to them that he came to be a Savior.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">During all their distress it was distressing to him. And his own personal messenger saved them. In his love and in his compassion he himself repurchased them, and he proceeded to lift them up and carry them all the days of long ago.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs11">And one began to remember the days of long ago, Moses his servant: “Where is the One that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is the One that put within him His own holy spirit?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>

       <span id="vs16">For you are our Father; although Abraham himself may not have known us and Israel himself may not recognize us, you, O Jehovah, are our Father. Our Repurchaser of long ago is your name.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Why do you, O Jehovah, keep making us wander from your ways? Why do you make our heart hard against the fear of you? Come back for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your hereditary possession.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs10">And Shar&acute;on must become a pasture ground for sheep and the low plain of A&acute;chor a resting-place for cattle, for my people who will have looked for me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are those leaving Jehovah, those forgetting my holy mountain, those setting in order a table for the god of Good Luck and those filling up mixed wine for the god of Destiny.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I will destine <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men to the sword, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> bow down to being slaughtered; for the reason that I called, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not answer; I spoke, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not listen; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept doing what was bad in my eyes, and the thing in which I took no delight <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> chose.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Look! My own servants will eat, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will go hungry. Look! My own servants will drink, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will go thirsty. Look! My own servants will rejoice, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will suffer shame.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Look! My own servants will cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will make outcries because of the pain of heart and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will howl because of sheer breakdown of spirit.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men will certainly lay up <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> name for an oath by my chosen ones, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will actually put [<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>] individually to death, but his own servants he will call by another name;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">so that anyone blessing himself in the earth will bless himself by the God of faith, and anyone making a sworn statement in the earth will swear by the God of faith; because the former distresses will actually be forgotten and because they will actually be concealed from my eyes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“For here I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But exult, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and be joyful forever in what I am creating. For here I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I will be joyful in Jerusalem and exult in my people; and no more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or the sound of a plaintive cry.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“No more will there come to be a suckling a few days old from that place, neither an old man that does not fulfill his days; for one will die as a mere boy, although a hundred years of age; and as for the sinner, although a hundred years of age he will have evil called down upon him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And it will actually occur that before they call out I myself shall answer; while they are yet speaking, I myself shall hear.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“The wolf and the lamb themselves will feed as one, and the lion will eat straw just like the bull; and as for the serpent, his food will be dust. They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,” Jehovah has said.</span>

       <span id="vs1">This is what Jehovah has said: “The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where, then, is the house that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people can build for me, and where, then, is the place as a resting-place for me?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Now all these things my own hand has made, so that all these came to be,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “To this one, then, I shall look, to the one afflicted and contrite in spirit and trembling at my word.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“The one slaughtering the bull is as one striking down a man. The one sacrificing the sheep is as one breaking the neck of a dog. The one offering up a gift—the blood of a pig! The one presenting a memorial of frankincense is as one saying a blessing with uncanny words. They are also the ones that have chosen their own ways, and in their disgusting things their very soul has taken a delight.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I myself, in turn, shall choose ways of ill-treating them; and the things frightful to them I shall bring upon them; for the reason that I called, but there was no one answering; I spoke, but there were none that listened; and they kept on doing what was bad in my eyes, and the thing in which I took no delight they chose.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Hear the word of Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men who are trembling at his word: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> brothers that are hating <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that are excluding <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by reason of my name, said, ‘May Jehovah be glorified!’ He must also appear with rejoicing on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part, and they are the ones that will be put to shame.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">There is a sound of uproar out of the city, a sound out of the temple! It is the sound of Jehovah repaying what is deserved to his enemies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Before she began to come into labor pains she gave birth. Before birth pangs could come to her, she even gave deliverance to a male child.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Who has heard of a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will a land be brought forth with labor pains in one day? Or will a nation be born at one time? For Zion has come into labor pains as well as given birth to her sons.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“As for me, shall I cause the breaking through and not cause the giving birth?” says Jehovah. “Or am I causing a giving birth and do I actually cause a shutting up?” your God has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Rejoice with Jerusalem and be joyful with her, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> lovers of her. Exult greatly with her, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keeping yourselves in mourning over her;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">for the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will suck and certainly get satisfaction from the breast of full consolation by her; for the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will sip and experience exquisite delight from the teat of her glory.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am extending to her peace just like a river and the glory of nations just like a flooding torrent, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly suck. Upon the flank <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be carried, and upon the knees <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be fondled.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting, so I myself shall keep comforting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people; and in the case of Jerusalem <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be comforted.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly see, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart will be bound to exult, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> very bones will sprout just like tender grass. And the hand of Jehovah will certainly be made known to his servants, but he will actually denounce his enemies.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“For here Jehovah himself comes as a very fire, and his chariots are like a storm wind, in order to pay back his anger with sheer rage and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For as fire Jehovah himself will for a fact take up the controversy, yes, with his sword, against all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah will certainly become many.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Those sanctifying themselves and cleansing themselves for the gardens behind one in the center, eating the flesh of the pig and the loathsome thing, even the jumping rodent, they will all together reach their end,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“And as regards their works and their thoughts, I am coming in order to collect all the nations and tongues together; and they will have to come and see my glory.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“And I will set among them a sign, and I will send some of those who are escaped to the nations, [to] Tar&acute;shish, Pul, and Lud, those drawing the bow, Tu&acute;bal and Ja&acute;van, the faraway islands, who have not heard a report about me or seen my glory; and they will for certain tell about my glory among the nations.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And they will actually bring all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers out of all the nations as a gift to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in covered wagons and on mules and on swift she-camels, up to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,” Jehovah has said, “just as when the sons of Israel bring the gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“And from them also I shall take some for the priests, for the Levites,” Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“For just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making are standing before me,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “so the offspring of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people and the name of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will keep standing.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“And it will certainly occur that from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh will come in to bow down before me,” Jehovah has said.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“And they will actually go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that were transgressing against me; for the very worms upon them will not die and their fire itself will not be extinguished, and they must become something repulsive to all flesh.”</span>
