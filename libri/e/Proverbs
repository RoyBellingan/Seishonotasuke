       <span id="vs2">for one to know wisdom and discipline, to discern the sayings of understanding,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">to receive the discipline that gives insight, righteousness and judgment and uprightness,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">to give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness, to a young man knowledge and thinking ability.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">A wise person will listen and take in more instruction, and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">to understand a proverb and a puzzling saying, the words of wise persons and their riddles.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge. Wisdom and discipline are what mere fools have despised.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For they are a wreath of attractiveness to your head and a fine necklace to your throat.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">My son, if sinners try to seduce you, do not consent.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs12">Let us swallow them down alive just like She&acute;ol, even whole, like those going down into a pit.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Let us find all sorts of precious valuables. Let us fill our houses with spoil.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Your lot you ought to cast in among us. Let there come to be just one bag belonging to all of us”—</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">my son, do not go in the way with them. Hold back your foot from their roadway.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For their feet are those that run to sheer badness, and they keep hastening to shed blood.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For it is for nothing that the net is spread before the eyes of anything owning wings.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Consequently they themselves lie in ambush for the very blood of these; they lie in concealment for their souls.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Thus are the paths of everyone making unjust profit. It takes away the very soul of its owners.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">True wisdom itself keeps crying aloud in the very street. In the public squares it keeps giving forth its voice.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At the upper end of the noisy streets it calls out. At the entrances of the gates into the city it says its own sayings:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“How long will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inexperienced ones keep loving inexperience, and [how long] must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ridiculers desire for yourselves outright ridicule, and [how long] will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> stupid ones keep hating knowledge?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Turn back at my reproof. Then to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> I will cause my spirit to bubble forth; I will make my words known to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Because I have called out but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep refusing, I have stretched out my hand but there is no one paying attention,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep neglecting all my counsel, and my reproof <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not accepted,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">I also, for my part, shall laugh at <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own disaster, I shall mock when what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> dread comes,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">when what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> dread comes just like a storm, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own disaster gets here just like a storm wind, when distress and hard times come upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">At that time they will keep calling me, but I shall not answer; they will keep looking for me, but they will not find me,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">for the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah they did not choose.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">They did not consent to my counsel; they disrespected all my reproof.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So they will eat from the fruitage of their way, and they will be glutted with their own counsels.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For the renegading of the inexperienced ones is what will kill them, and the easygoingness of the stupid is what will destroy them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">As for the one listening to me, he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">My son, if you have gone surety for your fellowman, [if] you have given your handshake even to the stranger,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">[if] you have been ensnared by the sayings of your mouth, [if] you have been caught by the sayings of your mouth,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">take this action then, my son, and deliver yourself, for you have come into the palm of your fellowman: Go humble yourself and storm your fellowman with importunities.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Do not give any sleep to your eyes, nor any slumber to your beaming eyes.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand and like a bird from the hand of the birdcatcher.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Go to the ant, you lazy one; see its ways and become wise.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Although it has no commander, officer or ruler,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">it prepares its food even in the summer; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">How long, you lazy one, will you keep lying down? When will you rise up from your sleep?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">A little more sleep, a little more slumbering, a little more folding of the hands in lying down,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and your poverty will certainly come just like some rover, and your want like an armed man.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">A good-for-nothing man, a man of hurtfulness, is walking with crookedness of speech,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">winking with his eye, making signs with his foot, making indications with his fingers.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Perverseness is in his heart. He is fabricating something bad all the time. He keeps sending out merely contentions.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">That is why suddenly there will come his disaster; in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no healing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">There are six things that Jehovah does hate; yes, seven are things detestable to his soul:</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">lofty eyes, a false tongue, and hands that are shedding innocent blood,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">a false witness that launches forth lies, and anyone sending forth contentions among brothers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Observe, O my son, the commandment of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Tie them upon your heart constantly; bind them upon your throat.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">When you walk about, it will lead you; when you lie down, it will stand guard over you; and when you have waked up, it itself will make you its concern.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For the commandment is a lamp, and a light the law is, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">to guard you against the bad woman, against the smoothness of the tongue of the foreign woman.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Do not desire her prettiness in your heart, and may she not take you with her lustrous eyes,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">because in behalf of a woman prostitute [one comes down] to a round loaf of bread; but as regards another man’s wife, she hunts even for a precious soul.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Can a man rake together fire into his bosom and yet his very garments not be burned?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Or can a man walk upon the coals and his feet themselves not be scorched?</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Likewise with anyone having relations with the wife of his fellowman, no one touching her will remain unpunishable.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">People do not despise a thief just because he commits thievery to fill his soul when he is hungry.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But, when found, he will make it good with seven times as much; all the valuables of his house he will give.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Anyone committing adultery with a woman is in want of heart; he that does it is bringing his own soul to ruin.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">A plague and dishonor he will find, and his reproach itself will not be wiped out.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For the rage of an able-bodied man is jealousy, and he will not show compassion in the day of vengeance.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">He will have no consideration for any sort of ransom, neither will he show willingness, no matter how large you make the present.</span>

       <span id="vs23">until an arrow cleaves open his liver, just as a bird hastens into the trap, and he has not known that it involves his very soul.</span>

       <span id="vs31">And, look! all of it produced weeds. Nettles covered its very surface, and its stone wall itself had been torn down.</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Do not go forth to conduct a legal case hastily, that it may not be a question of what you will do in the culmination of it when your fellowman now humiliates you.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs23">The wind from the north brings forth as with labor pains a downpour; and a tongue [giving away] a secret, a denounced face.</span>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Better is it to dwell upon a corner of a roof than with a contentious wife, although in a house in common.</span>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
