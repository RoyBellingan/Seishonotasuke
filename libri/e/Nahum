<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Jehovah is a God exacting exclusive devotion and taking vengeance; Jehovah is taking vengeance and is disposed to rage. Jehovah is taking vengeance against his adversaries, and he is resentful toward his enemies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power, and by no means will Jehovah hold back from punishing.</span>
