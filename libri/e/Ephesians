<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">This he caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and good sense,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the accurate knowledge of him;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">the eyes of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart having been enlightened, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may know what is the hope to which he called <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, what the glorious riches are which he holds as an inheritance for the holy ones,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and what the surpassing greatness of his power is toward us believers. It is according to the operation of the mightiness of his strength,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

       <span id="vs4">But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses—by undeserved kindness <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been saved—</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs15">By means of his flesh he abolished the enmity, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, that he might create the two peoples in union with himself into one new man and make peace;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and that he might fully reconcile both peoples in one body to God through the torture stake, because he had killed off the enmity by means of himself.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he came and declared the good news of peace to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, the ones far off, and peace to those near,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs2">with complete lowliness of mind and mildness, with long-suffering, putting up with one another in love,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs4">One body there is, and one spirit, even as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called in the one hope to which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">one God and Father of all [persons], who is over all and through all and in all.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now to each one of us undeserved kindness was given according to how the Christ measured out the free gift.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Wherefore he says: “When he ascended on high he carried away captives; he gave gifts [in] men.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now the expression “he ascended,” what does it mean but that he also descended into the lower regions, that is, the earth?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The very one that descended is also the one that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might give fullness to all things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs15">But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">From him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">This, therefore, I say and bear witness to in [the] Lord, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk in the unprofitableness of their minds,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">while they are in darkness mentally, and alienated from the life that belongs to God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the insensibility of their hearts.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Having come to be past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to loose conduct to work uncleanness of every sort with greediness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not learn the Christ to be so,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">provided, indeed, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard him and were taught by means of him, just as truth is in Jesus,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should put away the old personality which conforms to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should be made new in the force actuating <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mind,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Wherefore, now that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have put away falsehood, speak truth each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with his neighbor, because we are members belonging to one another.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in a provoked state,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">neither allow place for the Devil.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Let the stealer steal no more, but rather let him do hard work, doing with his hands what is good work, that he may have something to distribute to someone in need.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Let a rotten saying not proceed out of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Also, do not be grieving God’s holy spirit, with which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been sealed for a day of releasing by ransom.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> along with all badness.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>

       <span id="vs1">Therefore, become imitators of God, as beloved children,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and delivered himself up for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling odor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, just as it befits holy people;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting, things which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no fornicator or unclean person or greedy person—which means being an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Let no man deceive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with empty words, for because of the aforesaid things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore do not become partakers with them;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were once darkness, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are now light in connection with [the] Lord. Go on walking as children of light,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and quit sharing with [them] in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness, but, rather, even be reproving [them],</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">for the things that take place in secret by them it is shameful even to relate.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now all the things that are being reproved are made manifest by the light, for everything that is being made manifest is light.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Wherefore he says: “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and the Christ will shine upon you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So keep strict watch that how <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> walk is not as unwise but as wise [persons],</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">On this account cease becoming unreasonable, but go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Also, do not be getting drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery, but keep getting filled with spirit,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">speaking to yourselves with psalms and praises to God and spiritual songs, singing and accompanying yourselves with music in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts to Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always for all things to our God and Father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Be in subjection to one another in fear of Christ.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">because a husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation, he being a savior of [this] body.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, so let wives also be to their husbands in everything.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Husbands, continue loving <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, not having a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">because we are members of his body.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“For this reason a man will leave [his] father and [his] mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking with respect to Christ and the congregation.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Nevertheless, also, let each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> individually so love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Children, be obedient to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> parents in union with [the] Lord, for this is righteous:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Honor your father and [your] mother”; which is the first command with a promise:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“That it may go well with you and you may endure a long time on the earth.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, fathers, do not be irritating <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> slaves, be obedient to those who are [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] masters in a fleshly sense, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts, as to the Christ,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">not by way of eye-service as men pleasers, but as Christ’s slaves, doing the will of God whole-souled.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Be slaves with good inclinations, as to Jehovah, and not to men,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that each one, whatever good he may do, will receive this back from Jehovah, whether he be slave or freeman.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Also, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> masters, keep doing the same things to them, letting up on the threatening, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that the Master of both them and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is in the heavens, and there is no partiality with him.</span>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs17">Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">while with every form of prayer and supplication <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit. And to that end keep awake with all constancy and with supplication in behalf of all the holy ones,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">also for me, that ability to speak may be given me with the opening of my mouth, with freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">for which I am acting as an ambassador in chains; that I may speak in connection with it with boldness as I ought to speak.</span>

       <span id="vs21">Now in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may also know about my affairs, as to how I am doing, Tych&acute;i&middot;cus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in [the] Lord, will make everything known to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">I am sending him to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for this very purpose, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may know of the things having to do with us and that he may comfort <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts.</span>

       <span id="vs23">May the brothers have peace and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">May the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptness.</span>
