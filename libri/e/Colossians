       <span id="vs5">because of the hope that is being reserved for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the heavens. This [hope] <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard of before by the telling of the truth of that good news</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">which has presented itself to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, even as it is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world just as [it is doing] also among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, from the day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard and accurately knew the undeserved kindness of God in truth.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">That is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have learned from Ep&acute;a&middot;phras our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful minister of the Christ on our behalf,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

       <span id="vs16">because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All [other] things have been created through him and for him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and he is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that he might become the one who is first in all things;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">because [God] saw good for all fullness to dwell in him,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and through him to reconcile again to himself all [other] things by making peace through the blood [he shed] on the torture stake, no matter whether they are the things upon the earth or the things in the heavens.</span>

       <span id="vs22">he now has again reconciled by means of that one’s fleshly body through [his] death, in order to present <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> holy and unblemished and open to no accusation before him,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">provided, of course, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> continue in the faith, established on the foundation and steadfast and not being shifted away from the hope of that good news which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard, and which was preached in all creation that is under heaven. Of this [good news] I Paul became a minister.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I, in my turn, am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">I became a minister of this [congregation] in accordance with the stewardship from God which was given me in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> interest to preach the word of God fully,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">the sacred secret that was hidden from the past systems of things and from the past generations. But now it has been made manifest to his holy ones,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">to whom God has been pleased to make known what are the glorious riches of this sacred secret among the nations. It is Christ in union with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, the hope of [his] glory.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">He is the one we are publicizing, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man complete in union with Christ.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">To this end I am indeed working hard, exerting myself in accordance with the operation of him and which is at work in me with power.</span>

       <span id="vs1">For I want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to realize how great a struggle I am having in behalf of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and of those at La&middot;o&middot;di&middot;ce&acute;a and of all those who have not seen my face in the flesh,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">that their hearts may be comforted, that they may be harmoniously joined together in love and with a view to all the riches of the full assurance of [their] understanding, with a view to an accurate knowledge of the sacred secret of God, namely, Christ.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">This I am saying that no man may delude <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with persuasive arguments.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For though I am absent in the flesh, all the same I am with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> good order and the firmness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith toward Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Therefore, as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord, go on walking in union with him,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">rooted and being built up in him and being stabilized in the faith, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were taught, overflowing with [faith] in thanksgiving.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Look out: perhaps there may be someone who will carry <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are possessed of a fullness by means of him, who is the head of all government and authority.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">By relationship with him <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands by the stripping off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision that belongs to the Christ,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were buried with him in [his] baptism, and by relationship with him <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were also raised up together through [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] faith in the operation of God, who raised him up from the dead.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Furthermore, though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were dead in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trespasses and in the uncircumcised state of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flesh, [God] made <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> alive together with him. He kindly forgave us all our trespasses</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and blotted out the handwritten document against us, which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us; and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Stripping the governments and the authorities bare, he exhibited them in open public as conquered, leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Therefore let no man judge <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in eating and drinking or in respect of a festival or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">for those things are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Let no man deprive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of the prize who takes delight in a [mock] humility and a form of worship of the angels, “taking his stand on” the things he has seen, puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">whereas he is not holding fast to the head, to the one from whom all the body, being supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments, goes on growing with the growth that God gives.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> died together with Christ toward the elementary things of the world, why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, as if living in the world, further subject yourselves to the decrees:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">respecting things that are all destined to destruction by being used up, in accordance with the commands and teachings of men?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Those very things are, indeed, possessed of an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and [mock] humility, a severe treatment of the body; but they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh.</span>
