<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="24">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will, and Timothy [our] brother to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, together with all the holy ones who are in all of A&middot;cha&acute;ia:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those in any sort of tribulation through the comfort with which we ourselves are being comforted by God.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For just as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so the comfort we get also abounds through the Christ.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Now whether we are in tribulation, it is for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> comfort and salvation; or whether we are being comforted, it is for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> comfort that operates to make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> endure the same sufferings that we also suffer.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And so our hope for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is unwavering, knowing as we do that, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sharers of the sufferings, in the same way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will also share the comfort.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For we do not wish <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be ignorant, brothers, about the tribulation that happened to us in the [district of] Asia, that we were under extreme pressure beyond our strength, so that we were very uncertain even of our lives.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In fact, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death. This was that we might have our trust, not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">From such a great thing as death he did rescue us and will rescue us; and our hope is in him that he will also rescue us further.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> also can help along by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> supplication for us, in order that thanks may be given by many in our behalf for what is kindly given to us due to many [prayerful] faces.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For the thing we boast of is this, to which our conscience bears witness, that with holiness and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but with God’s undeserved kindness, we have conducted ourselves in the world, but more especially toward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For we are really not writing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> things except those which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> well know or also recognize; and which I hope <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will continue to recognize to the end,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have also recognized, to an extent, that we are a cause for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to boast, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will also be for us in the day of our Lord Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So, with this confidence, I was intending before to come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might have a second [occasion for] joy,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and after a stopover with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to go to Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a, and to come back from Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and be conducted partway by <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to Ju&middot;de&acute;a.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Well, when I had such an intention, I did not indulge in any lightness, did I? Or what things I purpose, do I purpose [them] according to the flesh, that with me there should be “Yes, Yes” and “No, No”?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But God can be relied upon that our speech addressed to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is not Yes and yet No.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> through us, that is, through me and Sil&middot;va&acute;nus and Timothy, did not become Yes and yet No, but Yes has become Yes in his case.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him. Therefore also through him is the “Amen” [said] to God for glory through us.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But he who guarantees that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and we belong to Christ and he who has anointed us is God.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">He has also put his seal upon us and has given us the token of what is to come, that is, the spirit, in our hearts.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now I call upon God as a witness against my own soul that it is to spare <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that I have not yet come to Corinth.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Not that we are the masters over <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith, but we are fellow workers for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> joy, for it is by [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] faith that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are standing.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For this is what I have decided for myself, not to come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> again in sadness.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For if I make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sad, who indeed is there to cheer me except the one that is made sad by me?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And so I wrote this very thing, that, when I come, I may not get sad because of those over whom I ought to rejoice; because I have confidence in all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that the joy I have is that of all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart I wrote <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with many tears, not that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might be saddened, but that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might know the love that I have more especially for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now if anyone has caused sadness, he has saddened, not me, but all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to an extent—not to be too harsh in what I say.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">so that, on the contrary now, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should kindly forgive and comfort [him], that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Therefore I exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to confirm <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> love for him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs10">Anything <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kindly forgive anyone, I do too.

       <span id="vs11">that we may not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his designs.</span>

       <span id="vs13">I got no relief in my spirit on account of not finding Titus my brother, but I said good-bye to them and departed for Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a.</span>

       <span id="vs10">In fact, even that which has once been made glorious has been stripped of glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels it.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For if that which was to be done away with was brought in with glory, much more would that which remains be with glory.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Therefore, as we have such a hope, we are using great freeness of speech,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and not doing as when Moses would put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of that which was to be done away with.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But their mental powers were dulled. For to this present day the same veil remains unlifted at the reading of the old covenant, because it is done away with by means of Christ.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In fact, down till today whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their hearts.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But when there is a turning to Jehovah, the veil is taken away.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Now Jehovah is the Spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as done by Jehovah [the] Spirit.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">That is why, since we have this ministry according to the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">but we have renounced the underhanded things of which to be ashamed, not walking with cunning, neither adulterating the word of God, but by making the truth manifest recommending ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For we are preaching, not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> slaves for Jesus’ sake.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For God is he who said: “Let the light shine out of darkness,” and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate [them] with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Always we endure everywhere in our body the death-dealing treatment given to Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our body.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For we who live are ever being brought face to face with death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently death is at work in us, but life in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now because we have the same spirit of faith as that of which it is written: “I exercised faith, therefore I spoke,” we too exercise faith and therefore we speak,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">knowing that he who raised Jesus up will raise us up also together with Jesus and will present us together with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For all things are for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sakes, in order that the undeserved kindness which was multiplied should abound because of the thanksgiving of many more to the glory of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Therefore we do not give up, but even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For though the tribulation is momentary and light, it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing weight and is everlasting;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">while we keep our eyes, not on the things seen, but on the things unseen. For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</span>

       <span id="vs1">For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, should be dissolved, we are to have a building from God, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For in this dwelling house we do indeed groan, earnestly desiring to put on the one for us from heaven,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">so that, having really put it on, we shall not be found naked.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In fact, we who are in this tent groan, being weighed down; because we want, not to put it off, but to put on the other, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now he that produced us for this very thing is God, who gave us the token of what is to come, that is, the spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">We are therefore always of good courage and know that, while we have our home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">for we are walking by faith, not by sight.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But we are of good courage and are well pleased rather to become absent from the body and to make our home with the Lord.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Therefore we are also making it our aim that, whether having our home with him or being absent from him, we may be acceptable to him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of the Christ, that each one may get his award for the things done through the body, according to the things he has practiced, whether it is good or vile.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we keep persuading men, but we have been made manifest to God. However, I hope that we have been made manifest also to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> consciences.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">We are not again recommending ourselves to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> an inducement for boasting in respect to us, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may have [an answer] for those who boast over the outward appearance but not over the heart.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For if we were out of our mind, it was for God; if we are sound in mind, it is for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have judged, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Consequently from now on we know no man according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, certainly we now know him so no more.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Consequently if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away, look! new things have come into existence.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and he committed the word of the reconciliation to us.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. As substitutes for Christ we beg: “Become reconciled to God.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">The one who did not know sin he made to be sin for us, that we might become God’s righteousness by means of him.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">A<span class="smallcaps">LLOW</span> room for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">I do not say this to condemn <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. For I have said before that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in our hearts to die and to live with us.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I have great freeness of speech toward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. I have great boasting in regard to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. I am filled with comfort, I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In fact, when we arrived in Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a, our flesh got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every manner—there were fights without, fears within.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Nevertheless God, who comforts those laid low, comforted us by the presence of Titus;</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">yet not alone by his presence, but also by the comfort with which he had been comforted over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, as he brought us word again of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> longing, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mourning, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Hence even if I saddened <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did at first regret it, (I see that that letter saddened <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, though but for a little while,)</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">now I rejoice, not because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were just saddened, but because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were saddened into repenting; for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were saddened in a godly way, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might suffer no damage in anything due to us.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For sadness in a godly way makes for repentance to salvation that is not to be regretted; but the sadness of the world produces death.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For, look! this very thing, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> being saddened in a godly way, what a great earnestness it produced in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, yes, clearing of yourselves, yes, indignation, yes, fear, yes, longing, yes, zeal, yes, righting of the wrong! In every respect <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> demonstrated yourselves to be chaste in this matter.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Certainly, although I wrote <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I did it, neither for the one who did the wrong, nor for the one who was wronged, but that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> earnestness for us might be made manifest among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the sight of God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">That is why we have been comforted.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs13-2">However, in addition to our comfort we rejoiced still more abundantly due to the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For if I have made any boast to him about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in truth, so also our boasting before Titus has proved to be true.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Also, his tender affections are more abundant toward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, while he calls to mind the obedience of all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, how <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received him with fear and trembling.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">I rejoice that in every way I may have good courage by reason of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now we let <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know, brothers, about the undeserved kindness of God that has been bestowed upon the congregations of Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">that during a great test under affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For according to their actual ability, yes, I testify, beyond their actual ability this was,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">while they of their own accord kept begging us with much entreaty for the [privilege of] kindly giving and for a share in the ministry destined for the holy ones.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And not merely as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through God’s will.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">This led us to encourage Titus that, just as he had been the one to initiate it among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, so too he should complete this same kind giving on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Nevertheless, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are abounding in everything, in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in this love of ours to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, may <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also abound in this kind giving.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">It is not in the way of commanding <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but in view of the earnestness of others and to make a test of the genuineness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> love, that I am speaking.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich he became poor for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sakes, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might become rich through his poverty.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And in this I render an opinion: for this matter is of benefit to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, seeing that already a year ago <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> initiated not only the doing but also the wanting [to do];</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">now, then, finish up also the doing of it, in order that, just as there was a readiness to want to do, so also there should be a finishing up of it out of what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For I do not mean for it to be easy for others, but hard on <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">but that by means of an equalizing <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> surplus just now might offset their deficiency, in order that their surplus might also come to offset <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> deficiency, that an equalizing might take place.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Just as it is written: “The person with much did not have too much, and the person with little did not have too little.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now thanks be to God for putting the same earnestness for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the heart of Titus,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">because he has indeed responded to the encouragement, but, being very earnest, he is going forth of his own accord to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But we are sending along with him the brother whose praise in connection with the good news has spread through all the congregations.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Not only that, but he was also appointed by the congregations to be our traveling companion in connection with this kind gift to be administered by us for the glory of the Lord and in proof of our ready mind.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Thus we are avoiding having any man find fault with us in connection with this liberal contribution to be administered by us.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For we “make honest provision, not only in the sight of Jehovah, but also in the sight of men.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Moreover, we are sending with them our brother whom we have often proved in many things to be earnest, but now much more earnest due to his great confidence in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">If, though, there is any question about Titus, he is a sharer with me and a fellow worker for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> interests; or if about our brothers, they are apostles of congregations and a glory of Christ.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore demonstrate to them the proof of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> love and of what we boasted about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, before the face of the congregations.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">for I know <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> readiness of mind of which I am boasting to the Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that A&middot;cha&acute;ia has stood ready now for a year, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> zeal has stirred up the majority of them.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But I am sending the brothers, that our boasting about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might not prove empty in this respect, but that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may really be ready, just as I used to say <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would be.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Otherwise, in some way, if Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans should come with me and find <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not ready, we—not to say <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>—should be put to shame in this assurance of ours.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Therefore I thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in advance and to get ready in advance <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bountiful gift previously promised, that thus this might be ready as a bountiful gift and not as something extorted.</span>

       <span id="vs10">Now he that abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to sow and will increase the products of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> righteousness.)</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In everything <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are being enriched for every sort of generosity, which produces through us an expression of thanks to God;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">because the ministry of this public service is not only to supply abundantly the wants of the holy ones but also to be rich with many expressions of thanks to God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Through the proof that this ministry gives, they glorify God because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are submissive to the good news about the Christ, as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> publicly declare <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are, and because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are generous in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> contribution to them and to all;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

       <span id="vs1">Now I myself, Paul, entreat <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by the mildness and kindness of the Christ, lowly though I am in appearance among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, whereas when absent I am bold toward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Indeed I beg that, when present, I may not use boldness with that confidence with which I am counting on taking bold measures against some who appraise us as if we walked according to [what we are in the] flesh.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to [what we are in the] flesh.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and we are holding ourselves in readiness to inflict punishment for every disobedience, as soon as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own obedience has been fully carried out.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> look at things according to their face value. If anyone trusts in himself that he belongs to Christ, let him again take this fact into account for himself, that, just as he belongs to Christ, so do we also.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For even if I should boast a bit too much about the authority that the Lord gave us to build <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up and not to tear <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> down, I would not be put to shame,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">that I may not seem to want to terrify <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by [my] letters.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For, say they: “[His] letters are weighty and forceful, but [his] presence in person is weak and [his] speech contemptible.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Let such a man take this into account, that what we are in our word by letters when absent, such we shall also be in action when present.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For we do not dare to class ourselves among some or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves. Certainly they in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves have no understanding.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For our part we will boast, not outside our assigned boundaries, but according to the boundary of the territory that God apportioned to us by measure, making it reach even as far as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Really we are not overstretching ourselves as if we did not reach to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for we were the first to come even as far as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in declaring the good news about the Christ.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">No, we are not boasting outside our assigned boundaries in the labors of someone else, but we entertain hope that, as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith is being increased, we may be made great among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with reference to our territory. Then we will abound still more,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">to declare the good news to the countries beyond <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, so as not to boast in someone else’s territory where things are already prepared.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“But he that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs2">For I am jealous over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with a godly jealousy, for I personally promised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in marriage to one husband that I might present <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as a chaste virgin to the Christ.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For, as it is, if someone comes and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> receive a spirit other than what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received, or good news other than what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> accepted, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> easily put up [with him].</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="13">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="21">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">I have to boast. It is not beneficial; but I shall pass on to supernatural visions and revelations of [the] Lord.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">I know a man in union with Christ who, fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught away as such to the third heaven.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Yes, I know such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know, God knows—</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">that he was caught away into paradise and heard unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to speak.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Over such a man I will boast, but I will not boast over myself, except as respects [my] weaknesses.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For if I ever do want to boast, I shall not be unreasonable, for I shall say the truth. But I abstain, in order that no one should put to my credit more than what he sees I am or he hears from me,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">just because of the excess of the revelations.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs7-2">Therefore, that I might not feel overly exalted, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me, that I might not be overly exalted.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In this behalf I three times entreated the Lord that it might depart from me;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and yet he really said to me: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for [my] power is being made perfect in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast as respects my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may like a tent remain over me.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in cases of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">I have become unreasonable. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> compelled me to, for I ought to have been recommended by <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. For I did not prove to be inferior to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] superfine apostles in a single thing, even if I am nothing.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Indeed, the signs of an apostle were produced among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by all endurance, and by signs and portents and powerful works.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For in what respect is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> became less than the rest of the congregations, except that I myself did not become a burden to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Kindly forgive me this wrong.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Look! This is the third time I am ready to come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and yet I will not become a burden. For I am seeking, not <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> possessions, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; for the children ought not to lay up for [their] parents, but the parents for [their] children.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For my part I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls. If I love <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the more abundantly, am I to be loved the less?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But be that as it may, I did not burden <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> down. Nevertheless, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, I was “crafty” and I caught <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> “by trickery.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As for any one of those I have dispatched to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I did not take advantage of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> through him, did I?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I urged Titus and I dispatched the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at all, did he? We walked in the same spirit, did we not? In the same footsteps, did we not?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> been thinking all this while that we have been making our defense to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? It is before God that we are speaking in connection with Christ. But, beloved ones, all things are for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> upbuilding.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For I am afraid that somehow, when I arrive, I may find <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not as I could wish and I may prove to be to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> could wish, but, instead, there should somehow be strife, jealousy, cases of anger, contentions, backbitings, whisperings, cases of being puffed up, disorders.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Perhaps, when I come again, my God might humiliate me among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I might mourn over many of those who formerly sinned but have not repented over their uncleanness and fornication and loose conduct that they have practiced.</span>
