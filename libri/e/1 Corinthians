       <span id="vs2">to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have been sanctified in union with Christ Jesus, called to be holy ones, together with all who everywhere are calling upon the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I always thank God for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in view of the undeserved kindness of God given to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in Christ Jesus;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">that in everything <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been enriched in him, in full ability to speak and in full knowledge,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">even as the witness about the Christ has been rendered firm among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not fall short in any gift at all, while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He will also make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> firm to the end, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be open to no accusation in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">God is faithful, by whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called into a sharing with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now I exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For the disclosure was made to me about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, my brothers, by those of [the house of] Chlo&acute;e, that dissensions exist among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">What I mean is this, that each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> says: “I belong to Paul,” “But I to A&middot;pol&acute;los,” “But I to Ce&acute;phas,” “But I to Christ.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">The Christ exists divided. Paul was not impaled for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, was he? Or were <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I am thankful I baptized none of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> except Cris&acute;pus and Ga&acute;ius,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">so that no one may say that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were baptized in my name.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Yes, I also baptized the household of Steph&acute;a&middot;nas. As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anybody else.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For Christ dispatched me, not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news, not with wisdom of speech, that the torture stake of the Christ should not be made useless.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For the speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is God’s power.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For it is written: “I will make the wisdom of the wise [men] perish, and the intelligence of the intellectual [men] I will shove aside.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? Where the debater of this system of things? Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish?</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not get to know God, God saw good through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For both the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks look for wisdom;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but we preach Christ impaled, to the Jews a cause for stumbling but to the nations foolishness;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">however, to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Because a foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> behold his calling of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, brothers, that not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth;</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame;</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things looked down upon, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">in order that no flesh might boast in the sight of God.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But it is due to him that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in union with Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom;</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">that it may be just as it is written: “He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs7">But we speak God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">This [wisdom] not one of the rulers of this system of things came to know, for if they had known [it] they would not have impaled the glorious Lord.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs13">These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by [the] spirit, as we combine spiritual [matters] with spiritual [words].</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Let a man so appraise us as being subordinates of Christ and stewards of sacred secrets of God.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Besides, in this case, what is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Now to me it is a very trivial matter that I should be examined by <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> or by a human tribunal. Even I do not examine myself.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For I am not conscious of anything against myself. Yet by this I am not proved righteous, but he that examines me is Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Hence do not judge anything before the due time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring the secret things of darkness to light and make the counsels of the hearts manifest, and then each one will have his praise come to him from God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Now, brothers, these things I have transferred so as to apply to myself and A&middot;pol&acute;los for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> good, that in our case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may learn the [rule]: “Do not go beyond the things that are written,” in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not be puffed up individually in favor of the one against the other.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For who makes you to differ from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, now, you did indeed receive [it], why do you boast as though you did not receive [it]?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men already have <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fill, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are rich already, are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have begun ruling as kings without us, have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? And I wish indeed that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had begun ruling as kings, that we also might rule with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as kings.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men appointed to death, because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">We are fools because of Christ, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are discreet in Christ; we are weak, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are strong; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in good repute, but we are in dishonor.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Down to this very hour we continue to hunger and also to thirst and to be scantily clothed and to be knocked about and to be homeless</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and to toil, working with our own hands. When being reviled, we bless; when being persecuted, we bear up;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">when being defamed, we entreat; we have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I am writing these things, not to shame <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but to admonish <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as my beloved children.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may have ten thousand tutors in Christ, [<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>] certainly [do] not [have] many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father through the good news.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">I entreat <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, therefore, become imitators of me.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">That is why I am sending Timothy to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, as he is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord; and he will put <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in mind of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus, just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Some are puffed up as though I were in fact not coming to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But I will come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> shortly, if Jehovah wills, and I shall get to know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but [their] power.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For the kingdom of God [lies] not in speech, but in power.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want? Shall I come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with a rod, or with love and mildness of spirit?</span>

       <span id="vs1">Does anyone of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that has a case against the other dare to go to court before unrighteous men, and not before the holy ones?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Or do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> unfit to try very trivial matters?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that we shall judge angels? Why, then, not matters of this life?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">If, then, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do have matters of this life to be tried, is it the men looked down upon in the congregation that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> put in as judges?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">I am speaking to move <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to shame. Is it true that there is not one wise man among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that will be able to judge between his brothers,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but brother goes to court with brother, and that before unbelievers?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Really, then, it means altogether a defeat for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are having lawsuits with one another.

Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not rather let yourselves be defrauded?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">To the contrary, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wrong and defraud, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers at that.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">What! Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And yet that is what some of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were. But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been washed clean, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been sanctified, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.</span>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">All things are lawful for me; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful for me; but I will not let myself be brought under authority by anything.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God will bring both it and them to nothing. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up out of [death] through his power.</span>

       <span id="vs15">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bodies are members of Christ? Shall I, then, take the members of the Christ away and make them members of a harlot? Never may that happen!</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">What! Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For, “The two,” says he, “will be one flesh.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Flee from fornication. Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but he that practices fornication is sinning against his own body.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now concerning the things about which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wrote, it is well for a man not to touch a woman;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">yet, because of prevalence of fornication, let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Let the husband render to [his] wife her due; but let the wife also do likewise to [her] husband.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">The wife does not exercise authority over her own body, but her husband does; likewise, also, the husband does not exercise authority over his own body, but his wife does.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Do not be depriving each other [of it], except by mutual consent for an appointed time, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may devote time to prayer and may come together again, that Satan may not keep tempting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> lack of self-regulation.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">However, I say this by way of concession, not in the way of a command.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But I wish all men were as I myself am. Nevertheless, each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now I say to the unmarried persons and the widows, it is well for them that they remain even as I am.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed [with passion].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">To the married people I give instructions, yet not I but the Lord, that a wife should not depart from her husband;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">but if she should actually depart, let her remain unmarried or else make up again with her husband; and a husband should not leave his wife.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But to the others I say, yes, I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and yet she is agreeable to dwelling with him, let him not leave her;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and yet he is agreeable to dwelling with her, let her not leave her husband.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to [his] wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> children would really be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But if the unbelieving one proceeds to depart, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not in servitude under such circumstances, but God has called <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to peace.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For, wife, how do you know but that you will save [your] husband? Or, husband, how do you know but that you will save [your] wife?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Only, as Jehovah has given each one a portion, let each one so walk as God has called him. And thus I ordain in all the congregations.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Was any man called circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has any man been called in uncircumcision? Let him not get circumcised.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Circumcision does not mean a thing, and uncircumcision means not a thing, but observance of God’s commandments [does].</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">In whatever state each one was called, let him remain in it.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Were you called when a slave? Do not let it worry you; but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For anyone in [the] Lord that was called when a slave is the Lord’s freedman; likewise he that was called when a freeman is a slave of Christ.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In whatever condition each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it associated with God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who had mercy shown him by the Lord to be faithful.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore I think this to be well in view of the necessity here with us, that it is well for a man to continue as he is.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Are you bound to a wife? Stop seeking a release. Are you loosed from a wife? Stop seeking a wife.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin. And if a virgin [person] married, such one would commit no sin. However, those who do will have tribulation in their flesh. But I am sparing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced. Henceforth let those who have wives be as though they had none,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">and also those who weep be as those who do not weep, and those who rejoice as those who do not rejoice, and those who buy as those not possessing,</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">and those making use of the world as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Indeed, I want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may gain the Lord’s approval.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But the married man is anxious for the things of the world, how he may gain the approval of his wife,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">and he is divided. Further, the unmarried woman, and the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit. However, the married woman is anxious for the things of the world, how she may gain the approval of her husband.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">But this I am saying for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> personal advantage, not that I may cast a noose upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but to move <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to that which is becoming and that which means constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, if that is past the bloom of youth, and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But if anyone stands settled in his heart, having no necessity, but has authority over his own will and has made this decision in his own heart, to keep his own virginity, he will do well.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Consequently he also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep [in death], she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in [the] Lord.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my opinion. I certainly think I also have God’s spirit.</span>

       <span id="vs5">For even though there are those who are called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Nevertheless, there is not this knowledge in all persons; but some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But food will not commend us to God; if we do not eat, we do not fall short, and, if we eat, we have no credit to ourselves.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But keep watching that this authority of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For if anyone should see you, the one having knowledge, reclining at a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be built up to the point of eating foods offered to idols?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Really, by your knowledge, the man that is weak is being ruined, [your] brother for whose sake Christ died.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people thus sin against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers and wound their conscience that is weak, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sinning against Christ.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh at all, that I may not make my brother stumble.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> my work in [the] Lord?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">If I am not an apostle to others, I most certainly am to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are the seal confirming my apostleship in relation to [the] Lord.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">My defense to those who examine me is as follows:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">We have authority to eat and drink, do we not?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">We have authority to lead about a sister as a wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Ce&acute;phas, do we not?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Or is it only Bar&acute;na&middot;bas and I that do not have authority to refrain from [secular] work?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Who is it that ever serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat some of the milk of the flock?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Am I speaking these things by human standards? Or does not the Law also say these things?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For in the law of Moses it is written: “You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain.” Is it bulls God is caring for?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Or is it altogether for our sakes he says it? Really for our sakes it was written, because the man who plows ought to plow in hope and the man who threshes ought to do so in hope of being a partaker.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">If we have sown spiritual things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, is it something great if we shall reap things for the flesh from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">If other men partake of this authority over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, do we not much more so? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this authority, but we are bearing all things, in order that we might not offer any hindrance to the good news about the Christ.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that the men performing sacred duties eat the things of the temple, and those constantly attending at the altar have a portion for themselves with the altar?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">In this way, too, the Lord ordained for those proclaiming the good news to live by means of the good news.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But I have not made use of a single one of these [provisions]. Indeed, I have not written these things that it should become so in my case, for it would be finer for me to die than—no man is going to make my reason for boasting void!</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">If, now, I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast, for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If I perform this willingly, I have a reward; but if I do it against my will, all the same I have a stewardship entrusted to me.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">What, then, is my reward? That while declaring the good news I may furnish the good news without cost, to the end that I may not abuse my authority in the good news.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For, though I am free from all persons, I have made myself the slave to all, that I may gain the most persons.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And so to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those under law I became as under law, though I myself am not under law, that I might gain those under law.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">To those without law I became as without law, although I am not without law toward God but under law toward Christ, that I might gain those without law.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may become a sharer of it with [others].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know that the runners in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may attain it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Moreover, every man taking part in a contest exercises self-control in all things. Now they, of course, do it that they may get a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore, the way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air;</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">but I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now I do not want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be ignorant, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and all got baptized into Moses by means of the cloud and of the sea;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and all ate the same spiritual food</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they used to drink from the spiritual rock-mass that followed them, and that rock-mass meant the Christ.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Nevertheless, on most of them God did not express his approval, for they were laid low in the wilderness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Now these things became our examples, for us not to be persons desiring injurious things, even as they desired them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; just as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they got up to have a good time.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Neither let us practice fornication, as some of them committed fornication, only to fall, twenty-three thousand [of them] in one day.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Neither let us put Jehovah to the test, as some of them put [him] to the test, only to perish by the serpents.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs11">Now these things went on befalling them as examples, and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">No temptation has taken <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> except what is common to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be tempted beyond what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be able to endure it.</span>

       <span id="vs16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ? The loaf which we break, is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Because there is one loaf, we, although many, are one body, for we are all partaking of that one loaf.</span>

       <span id="vs18">L<span class="smallcaps">OOK</span> at that which is Israel in a fleshly way: Are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with the altar?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">What, then, am I to say? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">No; but I say that the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I do not want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to become sharers with the demons.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot be partaking of “the table of Jehovah” and the table of demons.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>

       <span id="vs27">If anyone of the unbelievers invites <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wish to go, proceed to eat everything that is set before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, making no inquiry on account of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> conscience.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But if anyone should say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: “This is something offered in sacrifice,” do not eat on account of the one that disclosed it and on account of conscience.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other person. For why should it be that my freedom is judged by another person’s conscience?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">If I am partaking with thanks, why am I to be spoken of abusively over that for which I give thanks?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Therefore, whether <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Now I commend <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> because in all things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have me in mind and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are holding fast the traditions just as I handed [them] on to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But I want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Every man that prays or prophesies having something on his head shames his head;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">but every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a [woman] with a shaved head.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For if a woman does not cover herself, let her also be shorn; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For a man ought not to have his head covered, as he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is man’s glory.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and, what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Besides, in connection with [the] Lord neither is woman without man nor man without woman.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For just as the woman is out of the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are out of God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Judge for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Does not nature itself teach <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? Because her hair is given her instead of a headdress.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, if any man seems to dispute for some other custom, we have no other, neither do the congregations of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But, while giving these instructions, I do not commend <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> meet together.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For first of all, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come together in a congregation, I hear divisions exist among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and in some measure I believe it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For there must also be sects among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that the persons approved may also become manifest among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come together to one place, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s evening meal.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> eat [it], each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Certainly <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do have houses for eating and drinking, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not? Or do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing ashamed? What shall I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Shall I commend <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? In this I do not commend <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For I received from the Lord that which I also handed on to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and, after giving thanks, he broke it and said: “This means my body which is in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He did likewise respecting the cup also, after he had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood. Keep doing this, as often as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For as often as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> eat this loaf and drink this cup, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Consequently whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and thus let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment against himself if he does not discern the body.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">That is why many among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are weak and sickly, and quite a few are sleeping [in death].</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, that we may not become condemned with the world.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Consequently, my brothers, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come together to eat [it], wait for one another.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not come together for judgment. But the remaining matters I will set in order when I get there.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be ignorant.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> know that when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were people of the nations, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were being led away to those voiceless idols just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> happened to be led.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Therefore I would have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that nobody when speaking by God’s spirit says: “Jesus is accursed!” and nobody can say: “Jesus is Lord!” except by holy spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now there are varieties of gifts, but there is the same spirit;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and there are varieties of ministries, and yet there is the same Lord;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and there are varieties of operations, and yet it is the same God who performs all the operations in all persons.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For example, to one there is given through the spirit speech of wisdom, to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">to another faith by the same spirit, to another gifts of healings by that one spirit,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">to yet another operations of powerful works, to another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired utterances, to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But all these operations the one and the same spirit performs, making a distribution to each one respectively just as it wills.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For just as the body is one but has many members, and all the members of that body, although being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For truly by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink one spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the body, indeed, is not one member, but many.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">If the foot should say: “Because I am not a hand, I am no part of the body,” it is not for this reason no part of the body.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And if the ear should say: “Because I am not an eye, I am no part of the body,” it is not for this reason no part of the body.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If the whole body were an eye, where would the [sense of] hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the smelling be?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But now God has set the members in the body, each one of them, just as he pleased.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But now they are many members, yet one body.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">The eye cannot say to the hand: “I have no need of you”; or, again, the head [cannot say] to the feet: “I have no need of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we surround with more abundant honor, and so our unseemly parts have the more abundant comeliness,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">whereas our comely parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God compounded the body, giving honor more abundant to the part which had a lack,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have the same care for one another.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And if one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are Christ’s body, and members individually.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And God has set the respective ones in the congregation, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services, abilities to direct, different tongues.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all are translators, are they?</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But keep zealously seeking the greater gifts. And yet I show <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a surpassing way.</span>

       <span id="vs1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding [piece of] brass or a clashing cymbal.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And if I have the gift of prophesying and am acquainted with all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body, that I may boast, but do not have love, I am not profited at all.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Love never fails. But whether there are [gifts of] prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the [traits] of a babe.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now, however, there remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</span>

<p class="title">1 Corinthians 14:1-40</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="16">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="40">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Pursue love, yet keep zealously seeking the spiritual gifts, but preferably that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may prophesy.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For he that speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for no one listens, but he speaks sacred secrets by the spirit.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">However, he that prophesies upbuilds and encourages and consoles men by his speech.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">He that speaks in a tongue upbuilds himself, but he that prophesies upbuilds a congregation.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now I would like for all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to speak in tongues, but I prefer that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> prophesy. Indeed, he that prophesies is greater than he that speaks in tongues, unless, in fact, he translates, that the congregation may receive upbuilding.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But at this time, brothers, if I should come speaking to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in tongues, what good would I do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> unless I spoke to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As it is, the inanimate things give off sound, whether a flute or a harp; unless it makes an interval to the tones, how will it be known what is being played on the flute or on the harp?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For truly, if the trumpet sounds an indistinct call, who will get ready for battle?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In the same way also, unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> through the tongue utter speech easily understood, how will it be known what is being spoken? Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will, in fact, be speaking into the air.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">It may be that there are so many kinds of speech sounds in the world, and yet no [kind] is without meaning.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">If, then, I do not understand the force of the speech sound, I shall be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So also <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves, since <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are zealously desirous of [gifts of the] spirit, seek to abound in them for the upbuilding of the congregation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may translate.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For if I am praying in a tongue, it is my [gift of the] spirit that is praying, but my mind is unfruitful.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">What is to be done, then? I will pray with the [gift of the] spirit, but I will also pray with [my] mind. I will sing praise with the [gift of the] spirit, but I will also sing praise with [my] mind.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Otherwise, if you offer praise with a [gift of the] spirit, how will the man occupying the seat of the ordinary person say “Amen” to your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">True, you give thanks in a fine way, but the other man is not being built up.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I thank God, I speak in more tongues than all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Nevertheless, in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might also instruct others orally, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Brothers, do not become young children in powers of understanding, but be babes as to badness; yet become full-grown in powers of understanding.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In the Law it is written: “‘With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and yet not even then will they give heed to me,’ says Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Consequently tongues are for a sign, not to the believers, but to the unbelievers, whereas prophesying is, not for the unbelievers, but for the believers.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Therefore, if the whole congregation comes together to one place and they all speak in tongues, but ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are mad?</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are all prophesying and any unbeliever or ordinary person comes in, he is reproved by them all, he is closely examined by all;</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">the secrets of his heart become manifest, so that he will fall upon [his] face and worship God, declaring: “God is really among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">What is to be done, then, brothers? When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come together, one has a psalm, another has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a tongue, another has an interpretation. Let all things take place for upbuilding.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And if someone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or three at the most, and in turns; and let someone translate.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But if there be no translator, let him keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Further, let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern the meaning.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But if there is a revelation to another one while sitting there, let the first one keep silent.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And [gifts of] the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">For God is [a God], not of disorder, but of peace.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs33-2">As in all the congregations of the holy ones,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">let the women keep silent in the congregations, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but let them be in subjection, even as the Law says.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">If, then, they want to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in a congregation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">What? Was it from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that the word of God came forth, or was it only as far as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that it reached?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">If anyone thinks he is a prophet or gifted with the spirit, let him acknowledge the things I am writing to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because they are the Lord’s commandment.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">But if anyone is ignorant, he continues ignorant.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Consequently, my brothers, keep zealously seeking the prophesying, and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But let all things take place decently and by arrangement.</span>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of God.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But by God’s undeserved kindness I am what I am. And his undeserved kindness that was toward me did not prove to be in vain, but I labored in excess of them all, yet not I but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, whether it is I or they, so we are preaching and so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have believed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead, how is it some among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised up.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But if Christ has not been raised up, our preaching is certainly in vain, and our faith is in vain.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Moreover, we are also found false witnesses of God, because we have borne witness against God that he raised up the Christ, but whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For if the dead are not to be raised up, neither has Christ been raised up.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Further, if Christ has not been raised up, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith is useless; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are yet in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sins.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In fact, also, those who fell asleep [in death] in union with Christ perished.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death].</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a man.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For he must rule as king until [God] has put all enemies under his feet.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For [God] “subjected all things under his feet.” But when he says that ‘all things have been subjected,’ it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of [being] dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of [being] such?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Why are we also in peril every hour?</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Daily I face death. This I affirm by the exultation over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">If, like men, I have fought with wild beasts at Eph&acute;e&middot;sus, of what good is it to me? If the dead are not to be raised up, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Wake up to soberness in a righteous way and do not practice sin, for some are without knowledge of God. I am speaking to move <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to shame.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Nevertheless, someone will say: “How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what sort of body are they coming?”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies;</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">and as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat or any one of the rest;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and to each of the seeds its own body.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">The glory of the sun is one sort, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another; in fact, star differs from star in glory.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">It is sown in dishonor, it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised up in power.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">It is even so written: “The first man Adam became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Nevertheless, the first is, not that which is spiritual, but that which is physical, afterward that which is spiritual.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">As the one made of dust [is], so those made of dust [are] also; and as the heavenly one [is], so those who are heavenly [are] also.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">Look! I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a sacred secret: We shall not all fall asleep [in death], but we shall all be changed,</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">But when [this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and] this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: “Death is swallowed up forever.”</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">“Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?”</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">The sting producing death is sin, but the power for sin is the Law.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> labor is not in vain in connection with [the] Lord.</span>
