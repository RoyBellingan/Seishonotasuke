       <span id="vs1">These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the region of the Jordan in the wilderness, on the desert plains in front of Suph, between Pa&acute;ran and To&acute;phel and La&acute;ban and Ha&middot;ze&acute;roth and Di&acute;za&middot;hab,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">it being eleven days from Ho&acute;reb by the way of Mount Se&acute;ir to Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it came about that in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses spoke to the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah had commanded him for them,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">after his defeating Si&acute;hon the king of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, who was dwelling in Hesh&acute;bon, and Og the king of Ba&acute;shan, who was dwelling in Ash&acute;ta&middot;roth, in Ed&acute;re&middot;i.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In the region of the Jordan in the land of Mo&acute;ab Moses undertook to explain this law, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Jehovah our God spoke to us in Ho&acute;reb, saying, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have dwelt long enough in this mountainous region.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Turn and set out on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way and go into the mountainous region of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and to all their neighbors in the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah, the mountainous region and the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and the Neg&acute;eb and the seacoast, the land of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, and Leb&acute;a&middot;non, up to the great river, the river Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">See, I do put the land before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people. Go in and take possession of the land about which Jehovah swore to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give it to them and their seed after them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“And I proceeded to say this to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at that particular time, ‘I am not able by myself to carry <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God has multiplied <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and here <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are today like the stars of the heavens for multitude.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">May Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers increase <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a thousand times as many as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are, and may he bless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> just as he has promised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">How can I carry by myself the burden of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and the load of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> quarreling?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Get wise and discreet and experienced men of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tribes, that I may set them as heads over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> answered me and said, ‘The thing you have spoken for us to do is good.’</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So I took the heads of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tribes, men wise and experienced, and put them as heads over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds and chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens and officers of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tribes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“And I went on to command <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> judges at that particular time, saying, ‘When having a hearing between <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must judge with righteousness between a man and his brother or his alien resident.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not be partial in judgment. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> should hear the little one the same as the great one. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not become frightened because of a man, for the judgment belongs to God; and the case that is too hard for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should present to me, and I must hear it.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I proceeded to command <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at that particular time all the things that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should do.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Then we pulled away from Ho&acute;reb and went marching through all that great and fear-inspiring wilderness, which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have seen, by the way of the mountainous region of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, just as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we eventually came to Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">I now said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have come to the mountainous region of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">See, Jehovah your God has abandoned the land to you. Go up, take possession, just as Jehovah the God of your forefathers has spoken to you. Do not be afraid, nor be terrified.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“However, all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came near to me and said, ‘Do let us send men ahead of us that they may search out the land for us and bring us back word concerning the way by which we should go up and the cities to which we will come.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Well, the thing proved to be good in my eyes, so that I took twelve men of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>, one for each tribe.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then they turned and went up into the mountainous region and got as far as the torrent valley of Esh&acute;col and went spying on it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they proceeded to take some of the fruitage of the land in their hand and to bring it down to us, and they came bringing us back word and saying, ‘The land that Jehovah our God is giving us is good.’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not wish to go up, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> began to behave rebelliously against the order of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept grumbling in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tents and saying, ‘It was because Jehovah hated us that he brought us out of the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, to annihilate us.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Where are we going up? Our brothers have caused our heart to melt, saying: “A people greater and taller than we are, cities great and fortified to the heavens and also the sons of the An&acute;a&middot;kim we saw there.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“So I said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not suffer a shock or be afraid because of them.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is the one going before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. He will fight for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> according to all that he did with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in Egypt under <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own eyes,</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">and in the wilderness, where you saw how Jehovah your God carried you just as a man carries his son, in all the way that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> walked until <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> coming to this place.’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But despite this word <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were not putting faith in Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">who was going before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the way to spy out for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a place for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to camp, by fire at night for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to see by what way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should walk and by a cloud in daytime.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“All the while Jehovah heard the voice of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> words. So he became indignant and swore, saying,</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">‘Not one among these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">except Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh. He will see it, and to him and to his sons I shall give the land upon which he trod, by reason of the fact that he has followed Jehovah fully.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">(Even against me Jehovah got incensed on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> account, saying, ‘You too will not go in there.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Joshua the son of Nun, who is standing before you, is the one who will go in there.’ Him he has made strong, because he will cause Israel to inherit it.)</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones of whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> said: “Plunder they will become!” and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons who today do not know good or bad, these will go in there, and to them I shall give it, and they will take possession of it.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves, change your direction and pull away for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“At this <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Jehovah. We—we shall go up and fight in accord with all that Jehovah our God has commanded us!’ So <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> girded on, each one, his weapons of war and regarded it as easy to go up into the mountain.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">But Jehovah said to me, ‘Say to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not go up and fight, because I am not in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst; that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not be defeated before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies.”’</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">So I spoke to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not listen but began to behave rebelliously against Jehovah’s order and to get all heated up, and you tried to go up into the mountain.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Then the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were dwelling in that mountain came out to meet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and went chasing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, just as bees do, and scattering <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in Se&acute;ir as far as Hor&acute;mah.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">After that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> returned and began to weep before Jehovah, but Jehovah did not listen to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> voice, neither did he give ear to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">So <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept dwelling in Ka&acute;desh many days, as many days as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did dwell there.</span>

       <span id="vs4">And command the people, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are passing along by the border of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, the sons of E&acute;sau, who are dwelling in Se&acute;ir; and they will be afraid because of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must be very careful.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs9">Jehovah then said to me, ‘Do not molest Mo&acute;ab or engage in war with them, because I shall not give you any of his land as a holding, for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar as a holding.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs13">At this time rise and make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way across the torrent valley of Ze&acute;red.’ Accordingly we went crossing the torrent valley of Ze&acute;red.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the days that we walked from Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a until we crossed the torrent valley of Ze&acute;red were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war had come to their end from the midst of the camp, just as Jehovah had sworn to them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the hand of Jehovah also proved to be upon them to disquiet them out of the midst of the camp, until they came to their end.</span>

       <span id="vs19">and you must get close in front of the sons of Am&acute;mon.

       <span id="vs20">As the land of the Reph&acute;a&middot;im it also used to be considered. (The Reph&acute;a&middot;im dwelt in it in former times, and the Am&acute;mon&middot;ites used to call them Zam&middot;zum&acute;mim.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">They were a great and numerous and tall people like the An&acute;a&middot;kim; and Jehovah went annihilating them from before them, that they might dispossess them and dwell in their place;</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">just the same as he did for the sons of E&acute;sau, who are dwelling in Se&acute;ir, when he annihilated the Hor&acute;ites from before them, that they might dispossess them and dwell in their place until this day.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">As for the Av&acute;vim, who were dwelling in settlements as far as Ga&acute;za, the Caph&acute;to&middot;rim, who came out from Caph&acute;tor, annihilated them, that they might dwell in their place.)</span>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“‘G<span class="smallcaps">ET</span> up, pull away and cross the torrent valley of Ar&acute;non.

So start to take possession of his land, and engage in war with him.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">This day I shall start to put the dread of you and the fear of you before the peoples beneath all the heavens, who will hear the report about you; and they will indeed be agitated and have pains like those of childbirth because of you.’</span>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Ked&acute;e&middot;moth to Si&acute;hon the king of Hesh&acute;bon with words of peace, saying,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">‘Let me pass through your land. Only on the road I shall walk. I shall not turn to the right or to the left.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">What food you will sell me for money, I must eat; and what water you will give me for money, I must drink. Only let me pass through on my feet,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">just the same as the sons of E&acute;sau dwelling in Se&acute;ir and the Mo&acute;ab&middot;ites dwelling in Ar did to me, until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land that Jehovah our God is giving to us.’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And Si&acute;hon the king of Hesh&acute;bon did not let us pass through him, because Jehovah your God had let his spirit become obstinate and his heart become hard, in order to give him into your hand just as at this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“At this Jehovah said to me, ‘See, I have started to abandon Si&acute;hon and his land to you. Start to take possession of his land.’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">When Si&acute;hon came on out, he and all his people, to meet us in battle at Ja&acute;haz,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">then Jehovah our God abandoned him to us, so that we defeated him and his sons and all his people.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And we went capturing all his cities at that particular time and devoting every city to destruction, men and women and little children. We left no survivor.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Only the domestic animals did we take as plunder for ourselves, together with the spoil of the cities that we had captured.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">From A&middot;ro&acute;er, which is by the bank of the torrent valley of Ar&acute;non, and the city that is in the torrent valley, as far as Gil&acute;e&middot;ad, there proved to be no town that was too high up for us. Jehovah our God abandoned them all to us.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Only you did not go near the land of the sons of Am&acute;mon, the whole bank of the torrent valley of Jab&acute;bok, nor the cities of the mountainous region, nor anything about which Jehovah our God had given command.</span>

       <span id="vs13">And he will certainly love you and bless you and multiply you and bless the fruit of your belly and the fruit of your soil, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the young of your cows and the progeny of your flock, on the soil that he swore to your forefathers to give to you.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

       <span id="vs19">the great provings that your eyes saw, and the signs and the miracles and the strong hand and the outstretched arm with which Jehovah your God brought you out.

       <span id="vs3">And you well know today that Jehovah your God is crossing before you. A consuming fire he is. He will annihilate them, and he himself will subdue them before you; and you must dispossess them and destroy them speedily, just as Jehovah has spoken to you.</span>

       <span id="vs5">It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to take possession of their land; in fact, it is for the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you, and in order to carry out the word that Jehovah swore to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And you must know that it is not for your righteousness that Jehovah your God is giving you this good land to take possession of it; for you are a stiff-necked people.</span>

       <span id="vs8">Even in Ho&acute;reb <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> provoked Jehovah to anger so that Jehovah got incensed at <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the point of annihilating <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that Jehovah had concluded with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I kept dwelling in the mountain forty days and forty nights, (I neither ate bread nor drank water,)</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">then Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written upon with God’s finger; and upon them were all the words that Jehovah had spoken with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the congregation.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about that at the end of the forty days and forty nights Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and Jehovah proceeded to say to me, ‘Get up, go down quickly from here, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted ruinously. They have turned aside quickly from the way about which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten image.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jehovah went on to say this to me, ‘I have seen this people, and, look! it is a stiff-necked people.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Let me alone that I may annihilate them and wipe out their name from under the heavens, and let me make you a nation mightier and more populous than they are.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs16">Then I looked, and there <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had sinned against Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God! Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> had made yourselves a molten calf. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> had turned aside quickly from the way about which Jehovah had commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At that I took hold of the two tablets and flung them down from both my hands and shattered them before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I proceeded to prostrate myself before Jehovah, as at first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sin that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had committed in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah so as to offend him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For I was scared because of the hot anger with which Jehovah had got indignant at <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the point of annihilating <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. However, Jehovah listened to me also that time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“At Aaron, too, Jehovah got very incensed to the point of annihilating him; but I made supplication also in behalf of Aaron at that particular time.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sin that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had made, the calf, I took, and I proceeded to burn it in the fire and to crush it, grinding it thoroughly until it had become fine like dust; after which I threw its dust into the torrent that was descending from the mountain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Further, at Tab&acute;e&middot;rah and at Mas&acute;sah and at Kib&acute;roth-hat&middot;ta&acute;a&middot;vah <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> proved yourselves provokers of Jehovah to anger.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And when Jehovah sent <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a, saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I shall certainly give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>!’ then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> behaved rebelliously against the order of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not exercise faith toward him and did not listen to his voice.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have proved yourselves rebellious in behavior with Jehovah from the day of my knowing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“So I kept prostrating myself before Jehovah forty days and forty nights, for I prostrated myself thus because Jehovah talked of annihilating <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And I began to make supplication to Jehovah and to say, ‘O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, do not bring to ruin your people, even your private property, whom you redeemed with your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Do not turn your face to the hardness of this people and their wickedness and their sin,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">for fear the land out of which you brought us may say: “Because Jehovah was unable to bring them into the land that he had promised them, and because he hated them he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">They are, too, your people and your private property whom you brought out with your great power and your outstretched arm.’</span>

       <span id="vs2">And this is the manner of the release: there will be a releasing by every creditor of the debt that he may let his fellow incur. He should not press his fellow or his brother for payment, because a release to Jehovah must be called.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">The foreigner you may press for payment; but whatever of yours may prove to be with your brother let your hand release.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">However, no one should come to be poor among you, because Jehovah will without fail bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance to take possession of it,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">only if you will without fail listen to the voice of Jehovah your God so as to be careful to do all this commandment that I am commanding you today.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For Jehovah your God will indeed bless you just as he has promised you, and you will certainly lend on pledge to many nations, whereas you yourself will not borrow; and you must dominate over many nations, whereas over you they will not dominate.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“In case some one of your brothers becomes poor among you in one of your cities, in your land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not harden your heart or be closefisted toward your poor brother.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For you should generously open your hand to him and by all means lend him on pledge as much as he needs, which he is in want of.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Watch out for yourself for fear a base word should come to be in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of the release, has come close,’ and your eye should indeed become ungenerous toward your poor brother, and you should give him nothing, and he has to call out to Jehovah against you, and it has become a sin on your part.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">You should by all means give to him, and your heart should not be stingy in your giving to him, because on this account Jehovah your God will bless you in every deed of yours and in every undertaking of yours.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For someone poor will never cease to be in the midst of the land. That is why I am commanding you, saying, ‘You should generously open up your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land.’</span>

       <span id="vs13">And in case you should send him out from you as one set free, you must not send him out empty-handed.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">You should surely equip him with something from your flock and your threshing floor and your oil and winepress. Just as Jehovah your God has blessed you, you should give to him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And you must remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and Jehovah your God proceeded to redeem you. That is why I am commanding you this thing today.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“And it must occur that in case he says to you, ‘I shall not go out from your company!’ because he does love you and your household, since it was well with him while with you,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">you must also take an awl and put it through his ear and to the door, and he must become your slave to time indefinite. And to your slave girl you should also do this way.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">It should not be something hard in your eyes when you send him out from your company as one set free; because for double the value of a hired laborer he served you six years, and Jehovah your God has blessed you in everything that you would do.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Every male firstborn that will be born in your herd and in your flock you should sanctify to Jehovah your God. You must do no service with the firstborn of your bull, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Before Jehovah your God you should eat it year by year in the place that Jehovah will choose, you and your household.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And in case there should prove to be in it a defect, being lame or blind, any bad defect, you must not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Inside your gates you should eat it, the unclean one and the clean one together, like the gazelle and like the stag.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Only its blood you must not eat. Upon the earth you should pour it out as water.</span>

       <span id="vs26">and to the girl you must do nothing. The girl has no sin deserving of death, because just as when a man rises up against his fellowman and indeed murders him, even a soul, so it is with this case.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For it was in the field that he found her. The girl who was engaged screamed, but there was no one to rescue her.</span>

       <span id="vs50">a nation fierce in countenance, who will not be partial to an old man or show favor to a young man.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">And they will certainly eat the fruit of your domestic animals and the fruitage of your ground until you have been annihilated, and they will let no grain, new wine or oil, no young of your cattle or progeny of your flock, remain for you until they have destroyed you.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And they will indeed besiege you within all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you are trusting fall in all your land, yes, they will certainly besiege you within all your gates in all your land, which Jehovah your God has given you.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Then you will have to eat the fruit of your belly, the flesh of your sons and your daughters, whom Jehovah your God has given you, because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in.</span>

       <span id="vs55">so as not to give one of them any of the flesh of his sons that he will eat, because he has nothing at all remaining to him because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in within all your gates.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">As for the delicate and dainty woman among you who never attempted to set the sole of her foot upon the earth for being of dainty habit and for delicateness, her eye will be evil-inclined toward her cherished husband and her son and her daughter,</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">even toward her afterbirth that comes out from between her legs and toward her sons whom she proceeded to bear, because she will eat them in secrecy for the want of everything because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in within your gates.</span>

       <span id="vs59">Jehovah also will certainly make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring especially severe, great and long-lasting plagues, and malignant and long-lasting sicknesses.</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">And he will indeed bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt before which you got scared, and they will certainly hang onto you.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">Also, any sickness and any plague that is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah will bring them upon you until you have been annihilated.</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will indeed be left with very few in number, although <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have become like the stars of the heavens for multitude, because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.</span>

<p><a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">“And it must occur that just as Jehovah exulted over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> good and to multiply <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, so Jehovah will exult over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to destroy <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to annihilate <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will simply be torn away from off the soil to which you are going to take possession of it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">“And Jehovah will certainly scatter you among all the peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, and there you will have to serve other gods whom you have not known, neither you nor your forefathers, wood and stone.</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">And among those nations you will have no ease, nor will there prove to be any resting-place for the sole of your foot; and Jehovah will indeed give you there a trembling heart and a failing of the eyes and despair of soul.</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">And you will certainly be in the greatest peril for your life and be in dread night and day, and you will not be sure of your life.</span> <a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">In the morning you will say, ‘If it only were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If it only were morning!’ because of the dread of your heart with which you will be in dread and because of the sight of your eyes that you will see.</span> <a name="bk68" class="vsAnchor">68</a>
       <span id="vs68">And Jehovah will certainly bring you back to Egypt by ships by the way about which I have said to you, ‘You will never see it again,’ and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to sell yourselves there to your enemies as slave men and maidservants, but there will be no buyer.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">These are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to conclude with the sons of Israel in the land of Mo&acute;ab aside from the covenant that he had concluded with them in Ho&acute;reb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Moses proceeded to call all Israel and to say to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> were the ones seeing all that Jehovah did before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes in the land of Egypt to Phar&acute;aoh and all his servants and all his land,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">the great provings that your eyes saw, those great signs and miracles.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And yet Jehovah has not given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a heart to know and eyes to see and ears to hear down to this day.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">‘While I kept guiding <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forty years in the wilderness, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> garments did not wear out upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and your sandal did not wear out upon your foot.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Bread <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not eat, and wine and intoxicating liquor <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not drink, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might know that I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Eventually <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came to this place, and Si&acute;hon the king of Hesh&acute;bon and Og the king of Ba&acute;shan proceeded to come out to meet us in battle, but we defeated them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">After that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reu&acute;ben&middot;ites and the Gad&acute;ites and half the tribe of the Ma&middot;nas&acute;sites.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep the words of this covenant and do them, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may make everything <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will do turn out well.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> stationed today before Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, the heads of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tribes, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> older men and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> officers, every man of Israel,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11"><span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, and your alien resident who is in the midst of your camp, from the gatherer of your wood to the drawer of your water,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">in order for you to enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God and his oath, which Jehovah your God is concluding with you today;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">for the purpose of establishing you today as his people and that he may prove himself your God, just as he has promised you and just as he has sworn to your forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“Now it is not with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> alone that I am concluding this covenant and this oath,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">but it is with him who is here standing with us today before Jehovah our God and with those who are not here with us today;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">(for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves well know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the midst of the nations through whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> passed.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> used to see their disgusting things and their dungy idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, that were with them;)</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">that there may not be among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a man or a woman or a family or a tribe whose heart is turning today away from Jehovah our God to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there may not be among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a root bearing the fruit of a poisonous plant and wormwood.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“And it must occur that when someone has heard the words of this oath, and he has blessed himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall come to have peace, although I shall walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ with the intention of sweeping away the well-watered one along with the thirsty ones,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Jehovah will not want to forgive him, but then Jehovah’s anger and his ardor will smoke against that man, and all the oath written in this book will certainly settle down on him, and Jehovah will indeed wipe out his name from under the heavens.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So Jehovah will have to separate him for calamity from all the tribes of Israel in accord with all the oath of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“And the future generation, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons who will rise up after <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, will be bound to say, also the foreigner who will come from a distant land, even [when] they have seen the plagues of that land and its maladies with which Jehovah has sickened it,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">sulphur and salt and burning, so that its whole land will not be sown, nor sprout, nor will any vegetation spring up in it, like the overthrow of Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah, Ad&acute;mah and Ze&middot;boi&acute;im, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">yes, all the nations will be bound to say, ‘Why did Jehovah do like this to this land? Why the heat of this great anger?’</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then they will have to say, ‘It was because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah the God of their forefathers, which he concluded with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they proceeded to go and serve other gods and to bow down to them, gods that they had not known and he had not apportioned to them.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against that land by bringing upon it the whole malediction written in this book.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Hence Jehovah uprooted them from off their soil in anger and rage and great indignation and threw them into another land as at this day.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“The things concealed belong to Jehovah our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons to time indefinite, that we may carry out all the words of this law.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and said to them: “A hundred and twenty years old I am today. I shall no more be allowed to go out and come in, as Jehovah has said to me, ‘You will not cross this Jordan.’</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Jehovah your God is the one crossing before you. He himself will annihilate these nations from before you, and you must drive them away. Joshua is the one crossing before you, just as Jehovah has spoken.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jehovah will certainly do to them just as he has done to Si&acute;hon and to Og, the kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, and to their land, when he annihilated them.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jehovah has abandoned them to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must do to them according to all the commandment that I have commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">B<span class="smallcaps">E</span> courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or suffer a shock before them, because Jehovah your God is the one marching with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Moses proceeded to call Joshua and say to him before the eyes of all Israel: “Be courageous and strong, because you—you will bring this people into the land that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them, and you yourself will give it to them as an inheritance.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jehovah is the one marching before you. He himself will continue with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely. Do not be afraid or be terrified.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests the sons of Le&acute;vi, the carriers of the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, and to all the older men of Israel.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Moses went on to command them, saying: “At the end of every seven years, in the appointed time of the year of the release, in the festival of booths,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">when all Israel comes to see the face of Jehovah your God in the place that he will choose, you will read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones and your alien resident who is within your gates, in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn, as they must fear Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God and take care to carry out all the words of this law.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And their sons who have not known should listen, and they must learn to fear Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God all the days that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are living upon the soil to which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are crossing the Jordan to take possession of it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">After that Jehovah said to Moses: “Look! The days have drawn near for you to die. Call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and stationed themselves in the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud began to stand by the entrance of the tent.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Look! You are lying down with your forefathers; and this people will certainly get up and have immoral intercourse with foreign gods of the land to which they are going, in their very midst, and they will certainly forsake me and break my covenant that I have concluded with them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At that my anger will indeed blaze against them in that day, and I shall certainly forsake them and conceal my face from them, and they must become something to be consumed; and many calamities and distresses must come upon them, and they will be bound to say in that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not in our midst that these calamities have come upon us?’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">As for me, I shall absolutely conceal my face in that day because of all the badness that they have done, because they have turned to other gods.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“And now <span class="smallcaps">WRITE</span> for yourselves this song and teach it to the sons of Israel. Place it in their mouths in order that this song may serve as my witness against the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For I shall bring them to the ground that I have sworn about to their forefathers, which flows with milk and honey, and they will certainly eat and be satisfied and grow fat and turn to other gods, and they will indeed serve them and treat me with disrespect and break my covenant.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And it must occur that when many calamities and distresses will come upon them, this song must also answer before them as a witness, because it should not be forgotten out of the mouth of their offspring, for I well know their inclination that they are developing today before I bring them into the land about which I have sworn.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So Moses wrote this song in that day, that he might teach it to the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he proceeded to commission Joshua the son of Nun and to say: “Be courageous and strong, because you—you will bring the sons of Israel into the land about which I have sworn to them, and I myself shall continue with you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And it came about that as soon as Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book until their completion,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Moses began to command the Levites, the carriers of the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, saying:</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Taking this book of the law, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and it must serve as a witness there against you.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For I—I well know your rebelliousness and your stiff neck. If while I am yet alive with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> today, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have proved rebellious in behavior toward Jehovah, then how much more so after my death!</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Congregate to me all the older men of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tribes and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> officers, and let me speak in their hearing these words, and let me take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">For I well know that after my death <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will without fail act ruinously, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly turn aside from the way about which I have commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and calamity will be bound to befall <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at the close of the days, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah so as to offend him by the works of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And Moses proceeded to speak in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until their completion:</span>
