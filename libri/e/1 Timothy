       <span id="vs1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus under command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God [the] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Just as I encouraged you to stay in Eph&acute;e&middot;sus when I was about to go my way into Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a, so I do now, that you might command certain ones not to teach different doctrine,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies, which end up in nothing, but which furnish questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Really the objective of this mandate is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">By deviating from these things certain ones have been turned aside into idle talk,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">wanting to be teachers of law, but not perceiving either the things they are saying or the things about which they are making strong assertions.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now we know that the Law is fine provided one handles it lawfully</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">in the knowledge of this fact, that law is promulgated, not for a righteous man, but for persons lawless and unruly, ungodly and sinners, lacking loving-kindness, and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">fornicators, men who lie with males, kidnappers, liars, false swearers, and whatever other thing is in opposition to the healthful teaching</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy, because I was ignorant and acted with a lack of faith.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is the saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these I am foremost.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long-suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, [the] only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">This mandate I commit to you, child, Timothy, in accord with the predictions that led directly on to you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside and have experienced shipwreck concerning [their] faith.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Hy&middot;me&middot;nae&acute;us and Alexander belong to these, and I have handed them over to Satan that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme.</span>

       <span id="vs16">Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in [the] world, was received up in glory.’</span>

       <span id="vs2">by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs7">But turn down the false stories which violate what is holy and which old women tell. On the other hand, be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is that statement.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Do not severely criticize an older man. To the contrary, entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Honor widows that are actually widows.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household and to keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents, for this is acceptable in God’s sight.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now the woman who is actually a widow and left destitute has put her hope in God and persists in supplications and prayers night and day.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But the one that goes in for sensual gratification is dead though she is living.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So keep on giving these commands, that they may be irreprehensible.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Let a widow be put on the list who has become not less than sixty years old, a wife of one husband,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">having a witness borne to her for fine works, if she reared children, if she entertained strangers, if she washed the feet of holy ones, if she relieved those in tribulation, if she diligently followed every good work.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">On the other hand, turn down younger widows, for when their sexual impulses have come between them and the Christ, they want to marry,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">having a judgment because they have disregarded their first [expression of] faith.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At the same time they also learn to be unoccupied, gadding about to the houses; yes, not only unoccupied, but also gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs, talking of things they ought not.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore I desire the younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give no inducement to the opposer to revile.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Already, in fact, some have been turned aside to follow Satan.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">If any believing woman has widows, let her relieve them, and let the congregation not be under the burden. Then it can relieve those who are actually widows.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Let the older men who preside in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For the scripture says: “You must not muzzle a bull when it threshes out the grain”; also: “The workman is worthy of his wages.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Do not admit an accusation against an older man, except only on the evidence of two or three witnesses.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Reprove before all onlookers persons who practice sin, that the rest also may have fear.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to keep these things without prejudgment, doing nothing according to a biased leaning.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.</span>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.</span>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">The sins of some men are publicly manifest, leading directly to judgment, but as for other men [their sins] also become manifest later.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">In the same way also the fine works are publicly manifest and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hid.</span>
