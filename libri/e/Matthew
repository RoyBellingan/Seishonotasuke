       <span id="vs1">After Jesus had been born in Beth&acute;le&middot;hem of Ju&middot;de&acute;a in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from eastern parts came to Jerusalem,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">saying: “Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star [when we were] in the east, and we have come to do him obeisance.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At hearing this King Herod was agitated, and all Jerusalem along with him;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and on gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">They said to him: “In Beth&acute;le&middot;hem of Ju&middot;de&acute;a; for this is how it has been written through the prophet,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">‘And you, O Beth&acute;le&middot;hem of the land of Judah, are by no means the most insignificant [city] among the governors of Judah; for out of you will come forth a governing one, who will shepherd my people, Israel.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearing;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and, when sending them to Beth&acute;le&middot;hem, he said: “Go make a careful search for the young child, and when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have found it report back to me, that I too may go and do it obeisance.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When they had heard the king, they went their way; and, look! the star they had seen [when they were] in the east went ahead of them, until it came to a stop above where the young child was.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">On seeing the star they rejoiced very much indeed.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And when they went into the house they saw the young child with Mary its mother, and, falling down, they did obeisance to it. They also opened their treasures and presented it with gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">After they had withdrawn, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I give you word; for Herod is about to search for the young child to destroy it.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So he got up and took along the young child and its mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and he stayed there until the decease of Herod, for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Herod, seeing he had been outwitted by the astrologers, fell into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Beth&acute;le&middot;hem and in all its districts done away with, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then that was fulfilled which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“A voice was heard in Ra&acute;mah, weeping and much wailing; it was Rachel weeping for her children, and she was unwilling to take comfort, because they are no more.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When Herod had deceased, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">and said: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and be on your way into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the soul of the young child are dead.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So he got up and took the young child and its mother and entered into the land of Israel.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But hearing that Ar&middot;che&middot;la&acute;us ruled as king of Ju&middot;de&acute;a instead of his father Herod, he became afraid to depart for there. Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew into the territory of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and came and dwelt in a city named Naz&acute;a&middot;reth, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute;.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Ju&middot;de&acute;a,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">saying: “R<span class="smallcaps">EPENT</span>, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: “Listen! Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! Make his roads straight.’”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But this very John had his clothing of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins; his food too was insect locusts and wild honey.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Jerusalem and all Ju&middot;de&acute;a and all the country around the Jordan made their way out to him,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and people were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> offspring of vipers, who has intimated to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So then produce fruit that befits repentance;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Already the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">I, for my part, baptize <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with water because of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> repentance; but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not fit to take off. That one will baptize <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people with holy spirit and with fire.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will completely clean up his threshing floor, and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jesus came from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized by him.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In reply Jesus said to him: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Also, the Tempter came and said to him: “If you are a son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But in reply he said: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him upon the battlement of the temple</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and said to him: “If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will give his angels a charge concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone.’”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Jesus said to him: “Again it is written, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and he said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Jesus said to him: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then the Devil left him, and, look! angels came and began to minister to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Further, after leaving Naz&acute;a&middot;reth, he came and took up residence in Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um beside the sea in the districts of Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun and Naph&acute;ta&middot;li,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“O land of Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun and land of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Gal&acute;i&middot;lee of the nations!</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">From that time on Jesus commenced preaching and saying: “Repent, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Walking alongside the sea of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, letting down a fishing net into the sea, for they were fishers.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fishers of men.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">At once abandoning the nets, they followed him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Going on also from there he saw two others [who were] brothers, James [the son] of Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee and John his brother, in the boat with Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then he went around throughout the whole of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the report about him went out into all Syria; and they brought him all those faring badly, distressed with various diseases and torments, demon-possessed and epileptic and paralyzed persons, and he cured them.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Consequently great crowds followed him from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee and De&middot;cap&acute;o&middot;lis and Jerusalem and Ju&middot;de&acute;a and from the other side of the Jordan.</span>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs12">Rejoice and leap for joy, since <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.</span>

       <span id="vs18">for truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches mankind to that effect, he will be called ‘least’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. As for anyone who does them and teaches them, this one will be called ‘great’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that if <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> righteousness does not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder; but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">However, I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge&middot;hen&acute;na.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law, while you are with him on the way there, that somehow the complainant may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">I say to you for a fact, You will certainly not come out from there until you have paid over the last coin of very little value.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs2">Hence when you go making gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, just as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, They are having their reward in full.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right is doing,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">that your gifts of mercy may be in secret; then your Father who is looking on in secret will repay you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Also, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> pray, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not be as the hypocrites; because they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways to be visible to men. Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, They are having their reward in full.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">You, however, when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But when praying, do not say the same things over and over again, just as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So, do not make yourselves like them, for God <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father knows what things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are needing before ever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ask him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must pray, then, this way:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs9-2">“‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs13">And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“For if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forgive men their trespasses, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heavenly Father will also forgive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">whereas if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father forgive <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trespasses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are fasting, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, They are having their reward in full.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But you, when fasting, grease your head and wash your face,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but if your eye is wicked, your whole body will be dark. If in reality the light that is in you is darkness, how great that darkness is!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> cannot slave for God and for Riches.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“On this account I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: Stop being anxious about <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls as to what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat or what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will drink, or about <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bodies as to what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will wear. Does not the soul mean more than food and the body than clothing?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heavenly Father feeds them. Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not worth more than they are?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Also, on the matter of clothing, why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> anxious? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they are growing; they do not toil, nor do they spin;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">but I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that not even Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with little faith?</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heavenly Father knows <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> need all these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these [other] things will be added to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Sufficient for each day is its own badness.</span>

       <span id="vs11">Therefore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> children, how much more so will <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“All things, therefore, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want men to do to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also must likewise do to them; this, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Be on the watch for the false prophets that come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">By their fruits <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Likewise every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, neither can a rotten tree produce fine fruit.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Every tree not producing fine fruit gets cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Really, then, by their fruits <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will recognize those [men].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>! Get away from me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> workers of lawlessness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Therefore everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rock-mass.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded upon the rock-mass.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Now when Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After he had come down from the mountain great crowds followed him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, look! a leprous man came up and began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And so, stretching out [his] hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to. Be made clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for the purpose of a witness to them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">When he entered into Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, an army officer came to him, entreating him</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and saying: “Sir, my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis, being terribly tormented.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He said to him: “When I get there I will cure him.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In reply the army officer said: “Sir, I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof, but just say the word and my manservant will be healed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Be on your way!’ and he is on his way, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Hearing that, Jesus became amazed and said to those following him: “I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth, With no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that many from eastern parts and western parts will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as it has been your faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the manservant was healed in that hour.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed persons; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were faring badly;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to shove off for the other side.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And a certain scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you are about to go.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to leave and bury my father.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And when he got aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Now, look! a great agitation arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; he, however, was sleeping.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But he said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fainthearted, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with little faith?” Then, getting up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So the men became amazed and said: “What sort of person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">When he got to the other side, into the country of the Gad&middot;a&middot;renes&acute;, there met him two demon-possessed men coming out from among the memorial tombs, unusually fierce, so that nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And, look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But a long way off from them a herd of many swine was at pasture.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So the demons began to entreat him, saying: “If you expel us, send us forth into the herd of swine.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Accordingly he said to them: “Go!” They came out and went off into the swine; and, look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But the herders fled and, going into the city, they reported everything, including the affair of the demon-possessed men.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And, look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus; and after having seen him, they earnestly urged him to move out from their districts.</span>

       <span id="vs1">So, boarding the boat, he proceeded across and went into his own city.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, look! they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. On seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic: “Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And, look! certain of the scribes said to themselves: “This fellow is blaspheming.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> thinking wicked things in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For instance, which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up and walk?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">However, in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” then he said to the paralytic: “Get up, pick up your bed, and go to your home.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he got up and went off to his home.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At the sight of this the crowds were struck with fear, and they glorified God, who gave such authority to men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Next, while passing along from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew seated at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” Thereupon he did rise up and follow him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Later, while he was reclining at the table in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began reclining with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But on seeing this the Pharisees began to say to his disciples: “Why is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> teacher eats with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Hearing [them], he said: “Persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Go, then, and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then John’s disciples came to him and asked: “Why is it that we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast?”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, do they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old outer garment; for its full strength would pull from the outer garment and the tear would become worse.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">While he was telling them these things, look! a certain ruler who had approached began to do obeisance to him, saying: “By now my daughter must be dead; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will come to life.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Jesus, getting up, began to follow him; also his disciples did.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And, look! a woman suffering twelve years from a flow of blood came up behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment;</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">for she kept saying to herself: “If I only touch his outer garment I shall get well.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus turned around and, noticing her, said: “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And from that hour the woman became well.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">When, now, he came into the ruler’s house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd in noisy confusion,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Jesus began to say: “Leave the place, for the little girl did not die, but she is sleeping.” At this they began to laugh at him scornfully.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, and the little girl got up.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Of course, the talk about this spread out into all that region.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">As Jesus was passing along from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have faith that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then he touched their eyes, saying: “According to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith let it happen to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly charged them, saying: “See that nobody gets to know it.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But they, after getting outside, made it public about him in all that region.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Now when they were leaving, look! people brought him a dumb man possessed of a demon;</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">and after the demon had been expelled the dumb man spoke. Well, the crowds felt amazement and said: “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But the Pharisees began to say: “It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</span>

       <span id="vs26">Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">What I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the darkness, say in the light; and what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hear whispered, preach from the housetops.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Ge&middot;hen&acute;na.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father’s [knowledge].</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But the very hairs of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> head are all numbered.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Therefore have no fear: <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are worth more than many sparrows.</span>

       <span id="vs33">but whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth; I came to put, not peace, but a sword.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">He that finds his soul will lose it, and he that loses his soul for my sake will find it.</span>

       <span id="vs41">He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet’s reward, and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man’s reward.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> truly, he will by no means lose his reward.”</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>

       <span id="vs3">and said to him: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In reply Jesus said to them: “Go <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way and report to John what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are hearing and seeing:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The blind are seeing again, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, and the dead are being raised up, and the poor are having the good news declared to them;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">While these were on their way, Jesus started to say to the crowds respecting John: “What did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed being tossed by a wind?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">What, then, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Really, then, why did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and far more than a prophet.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Look! I myself am sending forth my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way ahead of you!’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For all, the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want to accept it, He himself is ‘E&middot;li&acute;jah who is destined to come.’</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Let him that has ears listen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“With whom shall I compare this generation? It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who cry out to their playmates,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">saying, ‘We played the flute for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not dance; we wailed, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not beat yourselves in grief.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Correspondingly, John came neither eating nor drinking, yet people say, ‘He has a demon’;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">the Son of man did come eating and drinking, still people say, ‘Look! A man gluttonous and given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he started to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place, because they did not repent:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Woe to you, Cho&middot;ra&acute;zin! Woe to you, Beth&middot;sa&acute;i&middot;da! because if the powerful works had taken place in Tyre and Si&acute;don that took place in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Consequently I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, It will be more endurable for Tyre and Si&acute;don on Judgment Day than for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And you, Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to Ha&acute;des you will come; because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sod&acute;om, it would have remained until this very day.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Consequently I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, It will be more endurable for the land of Sod&acute;om on Judgment Day than for you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At that time Jesus said in response: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to babes.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Yes, O Father, because to do thus came to be the way approved by you.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Come to me, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Take my yoke upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will find refreshment for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At that season Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He said to them: “Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Or, have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not read in the Law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple treat the sabbath as not sacred and continue guiltless?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that something greater than the temple is here.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">However, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice,’ <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would not have condemned the guiltless ones.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For Lord of the sabbath is what the Son of man is.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After departing from that place he went into their synagogue;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and, look! a man with a withered hand! So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath?” that they might get an accusation against him.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He said to them: “Who will be the man among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that has one sheep and, if this falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not get hold of it and lift it out?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">All considered, of how much more worth is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the sabbath.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him that they might destroy him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Having come to know [this], Jesus withdrew from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">but he strictly charged them not to make him manifest;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom my soul approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering flaxen wick will he extinguish, until he sends out justice with success.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Indeed, in his name nations will hope.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then they brought him a demon-possessed man, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Well, all the crowds were simply carried away and began to say: “May this not perhaps be the Son of David?”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Be&middot;el&acute;ze&middot;bub, the ruler of the demons.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Be&middot;el&acute;ze&middot;bub, by means of whom do <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons expel them? This is why they will be judges of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But if it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his movable goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“On this account I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“Either <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Offspring of vipers, how can <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> speak good things, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are wicked? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day;</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then as an answer to him some of the scribes and Pharisees said: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">In reply he said to them: “A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jo&acute;nah the prophet.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">For just as Jo&acute;nah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Men of Nin&acute;e&middot;veh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repented at what Jo&acute;nah preached, but, look! something more than Jo&acute;nah is here.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, but, look! something more than Sol&acute;o&middot;mon is here.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through parched places in search of a resting-place, and finds none.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Then it says, ‘I will go back to my house out of which I moved’; and on arriving it finds it unoccupied but swept clean and adorned.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then it goes its way and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and, after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">While he was yet speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and brothers took up a position outside seeking to speak to him.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">So someone said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">As an answer he said to the one telling him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: “Look! My mother and my brothers!</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">On that day Jesus, having left the house, was sitting by the sea;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and great crowds gathered to him, so that he went aboard a boat and sat down, and all the crowd was standing on the beach.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then he told them many things by illustrations, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and as he was sowing, some [seeds] fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Others fell upon the rocky places where they did not have much soil, and at once they sprang up because of not having depth of soil.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But when the sun rose they were scorched, and because of not having root they withered.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Others, too, fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Still others fell upon the fine soil and they began to yield fruit, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Let him that has ears listen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So the disciples came up and said to him: “Why is it you speak to them by the use of illustrations?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In reply he said: “To <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those people it is not granted.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For whoever has, more will be given him and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">This is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations, because, looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, neither do they get the sense of it;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and toward them the prophecy of Isaiah is having fulfillment, which says, ‘By hearing, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will hear but by no means get the sense of it; and, looking, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will look but by no means see.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes; that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back, and I heal them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“However, happy are <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes because they behold, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ears because they hear.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For I truly say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are beholding and did not see them, and to hear the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are hearing and did not hear them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, then, listen to the illustration of the man that sowed.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Where anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for the one sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man that sowed fine seed in his field.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat, and left.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">When the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds appeared also.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So the slaves of the householder came up and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it come to have weeds?’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">He said to them, ‘An enemy, a man, did this.’ They said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">He said, ‘No; that by no chance, while collecting the weeds, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> uproot the wheat with them.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up, then go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Another illustration he set before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain, which a man took and planted in his field;</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">which is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the largest of the vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Another illustration he spoke to them: “The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three large measures of flour, until the whole mass was fermented.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them;</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet who said: “I will open my mouth with illustrations, I will publish things hidden since the founding.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then after dismissing the crowds he went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: “Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">In response he said: “The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">the field is the world; as for the fine seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things, and the reapers are angels.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Therefore, just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and persons who are doing lawlessness,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him that has ears listen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid; and for the joy he has he goes and sells what things he has and buys that field.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">“Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Upon finding one pearl of high value, away he went and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">“Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering up [fish] of every kind.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">When it got full they hauled it up onto the beach and, sitting down, they collected the fine ones into vessels, but the unsuitable they threw away.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things: the angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">“Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> get the sense of all these things?” They said to him: “Yes.”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">Then he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Now when Jesus had finished these illustrations he went across country from there.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">And after coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: “Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works?</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man get all these things?”</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">So they began to stumble at him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not unhonored except in his home territory and in his own house.”</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">And he did not do many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At that particular time Herod, the district ruler, heard the report about Jesus</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why the powerful works are operating in him.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him away in prison on account of He&middot;ro&acute;di&middot;as the wife of Philip his brother.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to be having her.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the daughter of He&middot;ro&acute;di&middot;as danced at it and pleased Herod so much</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then she, under her mother’s coaching, said: “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Grieved though he was, the king out of regard for his oaths and for those reclining with him commanded it to be given;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And his head was brought on a platter and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Finally his disciples came up and removed the corpse and buried him and came and reported to Jesus.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At hearing this Jesus withdrew from there by boat into a lonely place for isolation; but the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now when he came forth he saw a great crowd; and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But when evening fell his disciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely and the hour is already far advanced; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves things to eat.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave: <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> give them something to eat.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They said to him: “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He said: “B<span class="smallcaps">RING</span> them here to me.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Next he commanded the crowds to recline on the grass and took the five loaves and two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he said a blessing and, after breaking the loaves, he distributed them to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the surplus of fragments, twelve baskets full.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Yet those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and young children.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then, without delay, he compelled his disciples to board the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Eventually, having sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. Though it became late, he was there alone.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">By now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land, being hard put to it by the waves, because the wind was against them.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But in the fourth watch period of the night he came to them, walking over the sea.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But at once Jesus spoke to them with the words: “Take courage, it is I; have no fear.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In reply Peter said to him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">He said: “Come!” Thereupon Peter, getting down off the boat, walked over the waters and went toward Jesus.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But looking at the windstorm, he got afraid and, after starting to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Immediately stretching out his hand Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And after they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: “You are really God’s Son.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And they got across and came to land in Gen&middot;nes&acute;a&middot;ret.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Upon recognizing him the men of that place sent forth into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And they went entreating him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment; and all those who touched it were made completely well.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="39">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">In reply he said to them: “Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also overstep the commandment of God because of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tradition?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For example, God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Let him that reviles father or mother end up in death.’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother: “Whatever I have by which you might get benefit from me is a gift dedicated to God,”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">he must not honor his father at all.’ And so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have made the word of God invalid because of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tradition.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, when he said,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">With that he called the crowd near and said to them: “Listen and get the sense of it:</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Not what enters into [his] mouth defiles a man; but it is what proceeds out of [his] mouth that defiles a man.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the disciples came up and said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees stumbled at hearing what you said?”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In reply he said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">L<span class="smallcaps">ET</span> them be. Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">By way of response Peter said to him: “Make the illustration plain to us.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At this he said: “Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also yet without understanding?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not aware that everything entering into the mouth passes along into the intestines and is discharged into the sewer?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">However, the things proceeding out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those things defile a man.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thieveries, false testimonies, blasphemies.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">These are the things defiling a man; but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Leaving there, Jesus now withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Si&acute;don.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And, look! a Phoe&middot;ni&acute;cian woman from those regions came out and cried aloud, saying: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is badly demonized.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But he did not say a word in answer to her. So his disciples came up and began to request him: “Send her away; because she keeps crying out after us.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In answer he said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">When the woman came she began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, help me!”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In answer he said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">She said: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Jesus said in reply to her: “O woman, great is your faith; let it happen to you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed from that hour on.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Crossing country from there, Jesus next came near the sea of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, and, after going up into the mountain, he was sitting there.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then great crowds approached him, having along with them people that were lame, maimed, blind, dumb, and many otherwise, and they fairly threw them at his feet, and he cured them;</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb speaking and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But Jesus called his disciples to him and said: “I feel pity for the crowd, because it is already three days that they have stayed with me and they have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away fasting. They may possibly give out on the road.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">However, the disciples said to him: “Where are we in this lonely place going to get sufficient loaves to satisfy a crowd of this size?”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">At this Jesus said to them: “How many loaves have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?” They said: “Seven, and a few little fishes.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">So, after instructing the crowd to recline upon the ground,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">he took the seven loaves and the fishes and, after offering thanks, he broke them and began distributing to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And all ate and were satisfied, and as a surplus of fragments they took up seven provision baskets full.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Yet those eating were four thousand men, besides women and young children.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Finally, after sending the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the regions of Mag&acute;a&middot;dan.</span>

<p class="title">Matthew 16:1-28</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="28">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="28">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him and, to tempt him, they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">In reply he said to them: “[[When evening falls <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are accustomed to say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red’;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and at morning, ‘It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red, but gloomy-looking.’ Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot interpret.]]</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jo&acute;nah.” With that he went away, leaving them behind.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take loaves along.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Jesus said to them: “Keep <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So they began to reason among themselves, saying: “We did not take any loaves along.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Knowing this, Jesus said: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> doing this reasoning among yourselves, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have no loaves, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with little faith?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not yet see the point, or do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not remember the five loaves in the case of the five thousand and how many baskets <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> took up?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Or the seven loaves in the case of the four thousand and how many provision baskets <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> took up?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">How is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not discern that I did not talk to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> about loaves? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now when he had come into the parts of Caes&middot;a&middot;re&acute;a Phi&middot;lip&acute;pi, Jesus went asking his disciples: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">They said: “Some say John the Baptist, others E&middot;li&acute;jah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">He said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, though, who do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say I am?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In answer Simon Peter said: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In response Jesus said to him: “Happy you are, Simon son of Jo&acute;nah, because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to you, but my Father who is in the heavens did.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Also, I say to you, You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Ha&acute;des will not overpower it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will be the thing bound in the heavens, and whatever you may loose on earth will be the thing loosed in the heavens.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he sternly charged the disciples not to say to anybody that he was the Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">From that time forward Jesus Christ commenced showing his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At this Peter took him aside and commenced rebuking him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this [destiny] at all.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But, turning his back, he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For the Son of man is destined to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will recompense each one according to his behavior.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that there are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.”</span>

<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother along and brought them up into a lofty mountain by themselves.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant as the light.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And, look! there appeared to them Moses and E&middot;li&acute;jah, conversing with him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Responsively Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, it is fine for us to be here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for E&middot;li&acute;jah.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">While he was yet speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and, look! a voice out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At hearing this the disciples fell upon their faces and became very much afraid.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Jesus came near and, touching them, said: “Get up and have no fear.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself only.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">However, the disciples put the question to him: “Why, then, do the scribes say that E&middot;li&acute;jah must come first?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In reply he said: “E&middot;li&acute;jah, indeed, is coming and will restore all things.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">However, I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that E&middot;li&acute;jah has already come and they did not recognize him but did with him the things they wanted. In this way also the Son of man is destined to suffer at their hands.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And when they came toward the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down to him and saying:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill, for he falls often into the fire and often into the water;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In reply Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? How long must I put up with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>? Bring him here to me.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out of him; and the boy was cured from that hour.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Thereupon the disciples came up to Jesus privately and said: “Why is it we could not expel it?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">He said to them: “Because of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little faith. For truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have faith the size of a mustard grain, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say to this mountain, ‘Transfer from here to there,’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">——</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">It was while they were gathered together in Gal&acute;i&middot;lee that Jesus said to them: “The Son of man is destined to be betrayed into men’s hands,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” Consequently they were very much grieved.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">After they arrived in Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um the men collecting the two drachmas [tax] approached Peter and said: “Does <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> teacher not pay the two drachmas [tax]?”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He said: “Yes.” However, when he entered the house Jesus got ahead of him by saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax? From their sons or from the strangers?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">When he said: “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him: “Really, then, the sons are tax-free.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But that we do not cause them to stumble, you go to the sea, cast a fishhook, and take the first fish coming up and, when you open its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In that hour the disciples came near to Jesus and said: “Who really is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So, calling a young child to him, he set it in their midst</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and said: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> turn around and become as young children, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one that is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me [also].</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who put faith in me, it is more beneficial for him to have hung around his neck a millstone such as is turned by an ass and to be sunk in the wide, open sea.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Woe to the world due to the stumbling blocks! Of course, the stumbling blocks must of necessity come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">If, then, your hand or your foot is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Also, if your eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Ge&middot;hen&acute;na.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">See to it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">——</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> think? If a certain man comes to have a hundred sheep and one of them gets strayed, will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And if he happens to find it, I certainly tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, Whatever things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may bind on earth will be things bound in heaven, and whatever things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may loose on earth will be things loosed in heaven.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Again I truly say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If two of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request, it will take place for them due to my Father in heaven.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then Peter came up and said to him: “Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy-seven times.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“That is why the kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">When he started to settle them, there was brought in a man who owed him ten thousand talents [=60,000,000 de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i].</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But because he did not have the means to pay [it] back, his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he had to be sold and payment to be made.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore the slave fell down and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay back everything to you.’</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Moved to pity at this, the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves that was owing him a hundred de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i; and, grabbing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back whatever you owe.’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Therefore his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay you back.’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">However, he was not willing, but went off and had him thrown into prison until he should pay back what was owing.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">When, therefore, his fellow slaves saw the things that had happened, they became very much grieved, and they went and made clear to their master all the things that had happened.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you, when you entreated me.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Ought you not, in turn, to have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I also had mercy on you?’</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">With that his master, provoked to wrath, delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay back all that was owing.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">In like manner my heavenly Father will also deal with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not forgive each one his brother from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee and came to the frontiers of Ju&middot;de&acute;a across the Jordan.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Also, great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Pharisees came up to him, intent on tempting him and saying: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of ground?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In reply he said: “Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not read that he who created them from [the] beginning made them male and female</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They said to him: “Why, then, did Moses prescribe giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He said to them: “Moses, out of regard for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hardheartedness, made the concession to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of divorcing <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, but such has not been the case from [the] beginning.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The disciples said to him: “If such is the situation of a man with his wife, it is not advisable to marry.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He said to them: “Not all men make room for the saying, but only those who have the gift.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs on account of the kingdom of the heavens. Let him that can make room for it make room for it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then young children were brought to him, for him to put his hands upon them and offer prayer; but the disciples reprimanded them.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Jesus, however, said: “Let the young children alone, and stop hindering them from coming to me, for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to suchlike ones.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he put his hands upon them and went from there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now, look! a certain one came up to him and said: “Teacher, what good must I do in order to get everlasting life?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">He said to him: “Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is that is good. If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He said to him: “Which ones?” Jesus said: “Why, You must not murder, You must not commit adultery, You must not steal, You must not bear false witness,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Honor [your] father and [your] mother, and, You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">The young man said to him: “I have kept all these; what yet am I lacking?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">When the young man heard this saying, he went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Again I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">When the disciples heard that, they expressed very great surprise, saying: “Who really can be saved?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Looking them in the face, Jesus said to them: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then Peter said to him in reply: “Look! We have left all things and followed you; what actually will there be for us?”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, In the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And everyone that has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive many times more and will inherit everlasting life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">“For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">When he had agreed with the workers for a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us a day, he sent them forth into his vineyard.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and to those he said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is just I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Finally, about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he said to them, ‘Why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> been standing here all day unemployed?’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They said to him, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> too go into the vineyard.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“When it became evening, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, proceeding from the last to the first.’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When the eleventh-hour men came, they each received a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So, when the first came, they concluded they would receive more; but they also received pay at the rate of a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">On receiving it they began to murmur against the householder</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and said, ‘These last put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But in reply to one of them he said, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us, did you not?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye wicked because I am good?’</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In this way the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Being now about to go up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples off privately and said to them on the road:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and will deliver him up to [men of] the nations to make fun of and to scourge and to impale, and the third day he will be raised up.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then the mother of the sons of Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">He said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Give the word that these my two sons may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus said in answer: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men do not know what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are asking for. Can <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">He said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">When the ten others heard of this, they became indignant at the two brothers.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But Jesus, calling them to him, said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">This is not the way among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; but whoever wants to become great among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must be <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> minister,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and whoever wants to be first among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must be <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> slave.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Now as they were going out of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho a great crowd followed him.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And, look! two blind men sitting beside the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But the crowd sternly told them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">So Jesus stopped, called them and said: “What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want me to do for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">They said to him: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received sight, and they followed him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Well, when they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Beth&acute;pha&middot;ge on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent forth two disciples,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">saying to them: “Be on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way into the village that is within sight of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will at once find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And if someone says anything to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them forth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">This actually took place that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet, saying:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“T<span class="smallcaps">ELL</span> the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! Your King is coming to you, mild-tempered, and mounted upon an ass, yes, upon a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs7">And they brought the ass and its colt, and they put upon these their outer garments, and he seated himself upon them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">As for the crowds, those going ahead of him and those following kept crying out: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was set in commotion, saying: “Who is this?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The crowds kept telling: “This is the prophet Jesus, from Naz&acute;a&middot;reth of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jesus entered into the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he said to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are making it a cave of robbers.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Also, blind and lame persons came up to him in the temple, and he cured them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys that were crying out in the temple and saying: “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” they became indignant</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and said to him: “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes. Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise’?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And leaving them behind he went outside the city to Beth&acute;a&middot;ny and passed the night there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">While returning to the city early in the morning, he got hungry.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves only, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you anymore forever.” And the fig tree withered instantly.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But when the disciples saw this, they wondered, saying: “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If only <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have faith and do not doubt, not only will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do what I did to the fig tree, but also if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And all the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ask in prayer, having faith, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will receive.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now after he went into the temple, the chief priests and the older men of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: “By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In reply Jesus said to them: “I, also, will ask <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> one thing. If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> tell it to me, I also will tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by what authority I do these things:</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?” But they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why, then, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not believe him?’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">If, though, we say, ‘From men,’ we have the crowd to fear, for they all hold John as a prophet.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So in answer to Jesus they said: “We do not know.” He, in turn, said to them: “Neither am I telling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by what authority I do these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in the vineyard.’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In answer this one said, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go out.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Approaching the second, he said the same. In reply this one said, ‘I will not.’ Afterwards he felt regret and went out.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Which of the two did the will of [his] father?” They said: “The latter.” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that the tax collectors and the harlots are going ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into the kingdom of God.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For John came to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in a way of righteousness, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the harlots believed him, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, although <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> saw [this], did not feel regret afterwards so as to believe him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“Hear another illustration: There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">When the season of the fruits came around, he dispatched his slaves to the cultivators to get his fruits.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">However, the cultivators took his slaves, and one they beat up, another they killed, another they stoned.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Again he dispatched other slaves, more than the first, but they did the same to these.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Lastly he dispatched his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">They said to him: “Because they are evil, he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Jesus said to them: “Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">This is why I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, The kingdom of God will be taken from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and be given to a nation producing its fruits.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Also, the person falling upon this stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his illustrations, they took note that he was speaking about them.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">But, although they were seeking to seize him, they feared the crowds, because these held him to be a prophet.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In further reply Jesus again spoke to them with illustrations, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that made a marriage feast for his son.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he sent forth his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Again he sent forth other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his commercial business;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but the rest, laying hold of his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“But the king grew wrathful, and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast indeed is ready, but those invited were not worthy.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Therefore go to the roads leading out of the city, and anyone <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> find invite to the marriage feast.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered together all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those reclining at the table.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“When the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight there of a man not clothed with a marriage garment.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here not having on a marriage garment?’ He was rendered speechless.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing of [his] teeth will be.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“For there are many invited, but few chosen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then the Pharisees went their way and took counsel together in order to trap him in his speech.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So they dispatched to him their disciples, together with party followers of Herod, saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care for anybody, for you do not look upon men’s outward appearance.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Tell us, therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> put me to the test, hypocrites?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Show me the head tax coin.” They brought him a de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;us.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Well, when they heard [that], they marveled, and leaving him they went off.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">On that day Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up to him and asked him:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If any man dies without having children, his brother must take his wife in marriage and raise up offspring for his brother.’</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and deceased, and, not having offspring, he left his wife for his brother.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">It went the same way also with the second and the third, until through all seven.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Last of all the woman died.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Consequently, in the resurrection, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all got her.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In reply Jesus said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are mistaken, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God;</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">As regards the resurrection of the dead, did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not read what was spoken to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by God, saying,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">On hearing [that], the crowds were astounded at his teaching.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">After the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together in one group.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And one of them, versed in the Law, asked, testing him:</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">This is the greatest and first commandment.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them:</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David’s.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">He said to them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration calls him ‘Lord,’ saying,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’?</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">If, therefore, David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, nor did anyone dare from that day on to question him any further.</span>

       <span id="vs28">In that way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also, outwardly indeed, appear righteous to men, but inside <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span>

       <span id="vs30">And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>

       <span id="vs33">Likewise also <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>

       <span id="vs37">For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark;</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>

       <span id="vs1">“Then the kingdom of the heavens will become like ten virgins that took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">whereas the discreet took oil in their receptacles with their lamps.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">While the bridegroom was delaying, they all nodded and went to sleep.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Right in the middle of the night there arose a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Be on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way out to meet him.’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then all those virgins rose and put their lamps in order.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The discreet answered with the words, ‘Perhaps there may not be quite enough for us and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Be on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way, instead, to those who sell it and buy for yourselves.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">While they were going off to buy, the bridegroom arrived, and the virgins that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Afterwards the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, sir, open to us!’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">In answer he said, ‘I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth, I do not know <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Keep on the watch, therefore, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know neither the day nor the hour.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“For it is just as when a man, about to travel abroad, summoned slaves of his and committed to them his belongings.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to still another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went abroad.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Immediately the one that received the five talents went his way and did business with them and gained five more.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In the same way the one that received the two gained two more.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But the one that received just one went off, and dug in the ground and hid the silver money of his master.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So the one that had received five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Master, you committed five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Finally the one that had received the one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be an exacting man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So I grew afraid and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In reply his master said to him, ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what is mine with interest.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“‘Therefore <span class="smallcaps">TAKE</span> away the talent from him and give it to him that has the ten talents.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing of [his] teeth will be.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the founding of the world.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">For I became hungry and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> gave me something to eat; I got thirsty and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received me hospitably;</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">naked, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> clothed me. I fell sick and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> looked after me. I was in prison and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came to me.’</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink?</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked, and clothe you?</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">When did we see you sick or in prison and go to you?’</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And in reply the king will say to them, ‘Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, To the extent that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did it to one of the least of these my brothers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did it to me.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“Then he will say, in turn, to those on his left, ‘Be on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way from me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">For I became hungry, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> gave me nothing to eat, and I got thirsty, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> gave me nothing to drink.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">I was a stranger, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not receive me hospitably; naked, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not look after me.’</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Then they also will answer with the words, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?’</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then he will answer them with the words, ‘Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, To the extent that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not do it to one of these least ones, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not do it to me.’</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> know that two days from now the passover occurs, and the Son of man is to be delivered up to be impaled.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then the chief priests and the older men of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest who was called Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and took counsel together to seize Jesus by crafty device and kill him.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">However, they kept saying: “Not at the festival, in order that no uproar may arise among the people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">While Jesus happened to be in Beth&acute;a&middot;ny in the house of Simon the leper,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">a woman with an alabaster case of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it upon his head as he was reclining at the table.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">On seeing this the disciples became indignant and said: “Why this waste?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For this could have been sold for a great deal and been given to poor people.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Aware of this, Jesus said to them: “Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> try to make trouble for the woman? For she did a fine deed toward me.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> always have the poor with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not always have me.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For when this woman put this perfumed oil upon my body, she did it for the preparation of me for burial.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did shall also be told as a remembrance of her.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then one of the twelve, the one called Judas Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot, went to the chief priests</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and said: “What will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> give me to betray him to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?” They stipulated to him thirty silver pieces.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So from then on he kept seeking a good opportunity to betray him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">On the first day of the unfermented cakes the disciples came up to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, The Teacher says, ‘My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the passover with my disciples at your home.’”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the disciples did as Jesus ordered them, and they got things ready for the passover.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">When, now, it had become evening, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">While they were eating, he said: “Truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, One of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will betray me.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Being very much grieved at this, they commenced each and every one to say to him: “Lord, it is not I, is it?”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In reply he said: “He that dips his hand with me in the bowl is the one that will betray me.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been finer for him if that man had not been born.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">By way of reply Judas, who was about to betray him, said: “It is not I, is it, Rabbi?” He said to him: “You yourself said [it].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: “T<span class="smallcaps">AKE</span>, eat. This means my body.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Also, he took a cup and, having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: “Drink out of it, all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>;</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I will by no means drink henceforth any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the kingdom of my Father.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then Jesus said to them: “All of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.’</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But Peter, in answer, said to him: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, never will I be stumbled!”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you, On this night, before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Peter said to him: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” All the other disciples also said the same thing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Geth&middot;sem&acute;a&middot;ne, and he said to the disciples: “Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee, he started to be grieved and to be sorely troubled.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then he said to them: “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And going a little way forward, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: “Could <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men not so much as watch one hour with me?</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Keep on the watch and pray continually, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Again, for the second time, he went off and prayed, saying: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for the third time, saying once more the same word.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them: “At such a time as this <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sleeping and taking <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> rest! Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And while he was yet speaking, look! Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and older men of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying: “Whoever it is I kiss, this is he; take him into custody.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And going straight up to Jesus he said: “Good day, Rabbi!” and kissed him very tenderly.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">But Jesus said to him: “Fellow, for what purpose are you present?” Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus and took him into custody.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">But, look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must take place this way?”</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: “Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come out with swords and clubs as against a robber to arrest me? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not take me into custody.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">But all this has taken place for the scriptures of the prophets to be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas the high priest, where the scribes and the older men were gathered together.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">But Peter kept following him at a good distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and, after going inside, he was sitting with the house attendants to see the outcome.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">Meantime the chief priests and the entire San&acute;he&middot;drin were looking for false witness against Jesus in order to put him to death,</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward. Later on two came forward</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">and said: “This man said, ‘I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.’”</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">With that the high priest stood up and said to him: “Have you no answer? What is it these are testifying against you?”</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">But Jesus kept silent. So the high priest said to him: “By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!”</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">Jesus said to him: “You yourself said [it]. Yet I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, From henceforth <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">Then the high priest ripped his outer garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have heard the blasphemy.</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">What is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> opinion?” They returned answer: “He is liable to death.”</span> <a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">Then they spit into his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him in the face,</span> <a name="bk68" class="vsAnchor">68</a>
       <span id="vs68">saying: “Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that struck you?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk69" class="vsAnchor">69</a>
       <span id="vs69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a servant girl came up to him, saying: “You, too, were with Jesus the Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;an!”</span> <a name="bk70" class="vsAnchor">70</a>
       <span id="vs70">But he denied it before them all, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”</span> <a name="bk71" class="vsAnchor">71</a>
       <span id="vs71">After he had gone out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him and said to those there: “This man was with Jesus the Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute;.”</span> <a name="bk72" class="vsAnchor">72</a>
       <span id="vs72">And again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man!”</span> <a name="bk73" class="vsAnchor">73</a>
       <span id="vs73">After a little while those standing around came up and said to Peter: “Certainly you also are one of them, for, in fact, your dialect gives you away.”</span> <a name="bk74" class="vsAnchor">74</a>
       <span id="vs74">Then he started to curse and swear: “I do not know the man!” And immediately a cock crowed.</span> <a name="bk75" class="vsAnchor">75</a>
       <span id="vs75">And Peter called to mind the saying Jesus spoke, namely: “Before a cock crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">When it had become morning, all the chief priests and the older men of the people held a consultation against Jesus so as to put him to death.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, after binding him, they led him off and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing he had been condemned, felt remorse and turned the thirty silver pieces back to the chief priests and older men,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">saying: “I sinned when I betrayed righteous blood.” They said: “What is that to us? You must see to that!”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and withdrew, and went off and hanged himself.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: “It is not lawful to drop them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">After consulting together, they bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Therefore that field has been called “Field of Blood” to this very day.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying: “And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price upon the man that was priced, the one on whom some of the sons of Israel set a price,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and they gave them for the potter’s field, according to what Jehovah had commanded me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jesus now stood before the governor; and the governor put the question to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied: “You yourself say [it].”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But, while he was being accused by the chief priests and older men, he made no answer.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Yet he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, the one they wanted.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Hence when they were gathered together Pilate said to them: “Which one do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want me to release to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas or Jesus the so-called Christ?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For he was aware that out of envy they had handed him over.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent out to him, saying: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But the chief priests and the older men persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas, but to have Jesus destroyed.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Now in responding the governor said to them: “Which of the two do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want me to release to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?” They said: “Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Pilate said to them: “What, then, shall I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?” They all said: “Let him be impaled!”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">He said: “Why, what bad thing did he do?” Still they kept crying out all the more: “Let him be impaled!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this [man]. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves must see to it.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At that all the people said in answer: “His blood come upon us and upon our children.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then he released Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be impaled.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace and gathered the whole body of troops together to him.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand. And, kneeling before him, they made fun of him, saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And they spit upon him and took the reed and began hitting him upon his head.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Finally, when they had made fun of him, they took the cloak off and put his outer garments upon him and led him off for impaling.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">As they were going out they found a native of Cy&middot;re&acute;ne named Simon. This man they impressed into service to lift up his torture stake.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And when they came to a place called <i>Gol&acute;go&middot;tha,</i> that is to say, Skull Place,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink; but, after tasting it, he refused to drink.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">When they had impaled him they distributed his outer garments by casting lots,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">and, as they sat, they watched over him there.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Also, they posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”</span>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then two robbers were impaled with him, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">So the passersby began speaking abusively of him, wagging their heads</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">and saying: “O you would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and older men began making fun of him and saying:</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe on him.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">In the same way even the robbers that were impaled together with him began reproaching him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">From the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land, until the ninth hour.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: <i>“E&acute;li, E&acute;li, la&acute;ma sa&middot;bach&middot;tha&acute;ni?”</i> that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling E&middot;li&acute;jah.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed and went giving him a drink.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether E&middot;li&acute;jah comes to save him.” [[Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out.]]</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up [his] spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">And, look! the curtain of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rock-masses were split.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And the memorial tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones that had fallen asleep were raised up,</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">(and persons, coming out from among the memorial tombs after his being raised up, entered into the holy city,) and they became visible to many people.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">But the army officer and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things happening, grew very much afraid, saying: “Certainly this was God’s Son.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">Moreover, many women were there viewing from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Gal&acute;i&middot;lee to minister to him;</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">among whom was Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene, also Mary the mother of James and Jo&acute;ses, and the mother of the sons of Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Now as it was late in the afternoon, there came a rich man of Ar&middot;i&middot;ma&middot;the&acute;a, named Joseph, who had also himself become a disciple of Jesus.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">This man went up to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given over.</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen,</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">and laid it in his new memorial tomb, which he had quarried in the rock-mass. And, after rolling a big stone to the door of the memorial tomb, he left.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">But Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">The next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate,</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">saying: “Sir, we have called to mind that that impostor said while yet alive, ‘After three days I am to be raised up.’</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">Therefore command the grave to be made secure until the third day, that his disciples may never come and steal him and say to the people, ‘He was raised up from the dead!’ and this last imposture will be worse than the first.”</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">Pilate said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have a guard. Go make it as secure as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know how.”</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and having the guard.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After the sabbath, when it was growing light on the first day of the week, Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene and the other Mary came to view the grave.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And, notice! a great earthquake had taken place; for Jehovah’s angel had descended from heaven and approached and rolled away the stone, and was sitting on it.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">His outward appearance was as lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Yes, for fear of him the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But the angel in answer said to the women: “Do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be fearful, for I know <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are looking for Jesus who was impaled.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">He is not here, for he was raised up, as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, and, look! he is going ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee; there <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see him. Look! I have told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And, look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and caught him by his feet and did obeisance to him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers, that they may go off into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee; and there they will see me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">While they were on their way, look! some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And after these had gathered together with the older men and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient number of silver pieces to the soldiers</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and said: “Say, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will persuade [him] and will set <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> free from worry.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed; and this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, the eleven disciples went into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and when they saw him they did obeisance, but some doubted.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. And, look! I am with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And, look! a leprous man came up and began doing obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And so, stretching out [his] hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to. Be made clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for the purpose of a witness to them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">When he entered into Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, an army officer came to him, entreating him</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and saying: “Sir, my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis, being terribly tormented.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He said to him: “When I get there I will cure him.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In reply the army officer said: “Sir, I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof, but just say the word and my manservant will be healed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Be on your way!’ and he is on his way, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Hearing that, Jesus became amazed and said to those following him: “I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth, With no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that many from eastern parts and western parts will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where [their] weeping and the gnashing of [their] teeth will be.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as it has been your faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the manservant was healed in that hour.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed persons; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were faring badly;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to shove off for the other side.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And a certain scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you are about to go.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to leave and bury my father.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And when he got aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Now, look! a great agitation arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; he, however, was sleeping.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But he said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fainthearted, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with little faith?” Then, getting up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So the men became amazed and said: “What sort of person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">When he got to the other side, into the country of the Gad&middot;a&middot;renes&acute;, there met him two demon-possessed men coming out from among the memorial tombs, unusually fierce, so that nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And, look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But a long way off from them a herd of many swine was at pasture.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So the demons began to entreat him, saying: “If you expel us, send us forth into the herd of swine.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Accordingly he said to them: “Go!” They came out and went off into the swine; and, look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But the herders fled and, going into the city, they reported everything, including the affair of the demon-possessed men.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And, look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus; and after having seen him, they earnestly urged him to move out from their districts.</span>
