<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now King David was old, advanced in days; and they would cover him with garments, but he would not feel warm.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So his servants said to him: “Let them look for a girl, a virgin, for my lord the king, and she will have to attend upon the king, that she may become his nurse; and she must lie in your bosom, and my lord the king will certainly feel warm.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And they went looking for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and finally found Ab&acute;i&middot;shag the Shu&acute;nam&middot;mite and then brought her in to the king.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the girl was beautiful in the extreme; and she came to be the king’s nurse and kept waiting upon him, and the king himself had no intercourse with her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">All the while Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah the son of Hag&acute;gith was lifting himself up, saying: “I myself am going to rule as king!” And he proceeded to have a chariot made for himself with horsemen and fifty men running before him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And his father did not hurt his feelings at any time by saying: “Why is this the way you have done?” And he was also very good-looking in form, and [his mother] had borne him after Ab&acute;sa&middot;lom.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he came to have dealings with Jo&acute;ab the son of Ze&middot;ru&acute;iah and with A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest, and they began offering help as followers of Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">As for Za&acute;dok the priest and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da and Nathan the prophet and Shim&acute;e&middot;i and Re&acute;i and the mighty men that belonged to David, they did not become involved with Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Eventually Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah held a sacrifice of sheep and cattle and fatlings close by the stone of Zo&acute;he&middot;leth, which is beside En-ro&acute;gel, and he proceeded to invite all his brothers the king’s sons and all the men of Judah the king’s servants;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and Nathan the prophet and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah and the mighty men and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his brother he did not invite.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Nathan now said to Bath-she&acute;ba, Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s mother: “Have you not heard that Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah the son of Hag&acute;gith has become king, and our lord David does not know of it at all?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So now come, let me, please, solemnly counsel you. And provide escape for your own soul and for the soul of your son Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Go and enter in to King David, and you must say to him, ‘Was it not you, my lord the king, that swore to your slave girl, saying: “Sol&acute;o&middot;mon your son is the one that will become king after me, and he is the one that will sit upon my throne”? So why has Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah become king?’</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Look! While you are yet speaking there with the king, then I myself shall come in after you, and I shall certainly confirm your words.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Accordingly Bath-she&acute;ba went in to the king in the interior room, and the king was very old, and Ab&acute;i&middot;shag the Shu&acute;nam&middot;mite was waiting upon the king.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Bath-she&acute;ba bowed low and prostrated herself to the king, upon which the king said: “What do you have [to ask]?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At this she said to him: “My lord, it was you that swore by Jehovah your God to your slave girl, ‘Sol&acute;o&middot;mon your son is the one that will become king after me, and he is the one that will sit upon my throne.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And now, look! Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah himself has become king, and now my lord the king himself does not know of it at all.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So he sacrificed bulls and fatlings and sheep in great quantity and invited all the sons of the king and A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest and Jo&acute;ab the chief of the army; but Sol&acute;o&middot;mon your servant he has not invited.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And you my lord the king—the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who is going to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And it will certainly occur that as soon as my lord the king lies down with his forefathers, I myself and also my son Sol&acute;o&middot;mon shall certainly become offenders.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And, look! while she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet himself came in.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At once they told the king, saying: “Here is Nathan the prophet!” After that he came in before the king and prostrated himself to the king with his face to the earth.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then Nathan said: “My lord the king, did you yourself say, ‘Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah is the one that will become king after me, and he is the one that will sit upon my throne’?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For he has today gone down that he might sacrifice bulls and fatlings and sheep in great quantity and might invite all the sons of the king and the chiefs of the army and A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest; and there they are eating and drinking before him and they keep saying, ‘Let King Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah live!’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But as for me your servant, me and Za&acute;dok the priest and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon your servant he has not invited.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">If it is from my lord the king that this thing has been brought about, then you have not caused your servant to know who should sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">King David now answered and said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, call Bath-she&acute;ba for me.” At that she came in before the king and stood before the king.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the king proceeded to swear and say: “As Jehovah is living who redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">just as I have sworn to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, ‘Sol&acute;o&middot;mon your son is the one that will become king after me, and he is the one that will sit upon my throne in place of me!’ that is the way I shall do this day.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then Bath-she&acute;ba bowed low with her face to the earth and prostrated herself to the king and said: “Let my lord King David live to time indefinite!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Immediately King David said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, call for me Za&acute;dok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da.” So they came in before the king.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the king went on to say to them: “Take with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the servants of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> lord, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must make Sol&acute;o&middot;mon my son ride upon the she-mule that belongs to me and lead him down to Gi&acute;hon.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And Za&acute;dok the priest and Nathan the prophet must anoint him there as king over Israel; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must blow the horn and say, ‘Let King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon live!’</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must come up following him, and he must come in and sit upon my throne; and he himself will be king in place of me, and him I shall have to commission to become leader over Israel and over Judah.”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">At once Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da answered the king and said: “Amen! Thus may Jehovah the God of my lord the king say.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Just as Jehovah proved to be with my lord the king, so let him prove to be with Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and may he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And Za&acute;dok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da and the Cher&acute;e&middot;thites and the Pel&acute;e&middot;thites proceeded to go down and make Sol&acute;o&middot;mon ride upon the she-mule of King David, and then brought him to Gi&acute;hon.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Za&acute;dok the priest now took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed Sol&acute;o&middot;mon; and they began to blow the horn, and all the people broke out saying: “Let King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon live!”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">After that all the people came on up following him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by the noise of them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah and all the ones invited that were with him got to hear it, when they themselves had finished eating. When Jo&acute;ab got to hear the sound of the horn, he at once said: “What does the noise of the town in an uproar mean?”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">While he was yet speaking, why, here Jon&acute;a&middot;than the son of A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest came. Then Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah said: “Come on in, for you are a valiant man, and you bring good news.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">But Jon&acute;a&middot;than answered and said to Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah: “No! Our lord King David himself has made Sol&acute;o&middot;mon king.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">So the king sent with him Za&acute;dok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da and the Cher&acute;e&middot;thites and the Pel&acute;e&middot;thites, and they made him ride upon the she-mule of the king.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Then Za&acute;dok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king in Gi&acute;hon; after which they came up from there rejoicing, and the town is in an uproar. That was the noise that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men heard.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And, besides, Sol&acute;o&middot;mon has sat down upon the throne of the kingship.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And, another thing, the servants of the king have come in to wish our lord King David well, saying, ‘May your God make Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s name more splendid than your name, and may he make his throne greater than your throne!’ At that the king bowed down upon the bed.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And too this is what the king said, ‘Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who has today given one to sit upon my throne, with my own eyes seeing it!’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">And all those invited that were with Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah began to tremble and rise up and go each one on his own way.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">And Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah himself was afraid because of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon. So he rose up and went away and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">In time the report was made to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, saying: “Here Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah himself has become afraid of King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon; and here he has taken hold on the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon first of all swear to me that he will not put his servant to death by the sword.’”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">To this Sol&acute;o&middot;mon said: “If he will become a valiant man, there will not fall a single hair of his to the earth; but if what is bad should be found in him, he will also have to die.”</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">So King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon sent and they brought him down from off the altar. Then he came in and bowed down to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon; after which Sol&acute;o&middot;mon said to him: “Go to your own house.”</span>

       <span id="vs8">“And here there is with you Shim&acute;e&middot;i the son of Ge&acute;ra the Ben&acute;ja&middot;min&middot;ite from Ba&middot;hu&acute;rim, and he it was that called down evil upon me with a painful malediction on the day that I was going to Ma&middot;ha&middot;na&acute;im; and he it was that came down to meet me at the Jordan, so that I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, ‘I shall not put you to death by the sword.’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And now do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man and you well know what you ought to do to him, and you must bring his gray hairs down to She&acute;ol with blood.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then David lay down with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the days that David had reigned over Israel were forty years. In He&acute;bron he had reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he had reigned thirty-three years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, he sat down upon the throne of David his father; and gradually his kingship became very firmly established.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In time Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah the son of Hag&acute;gith came to Bath-she&acute;ba, Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s mother. At this she said: “Is your coming peaceable?” to which he said: “It is peaceable.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he went on to say: “There is a matter I have for you.” So she said: “Speak.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he continued: “You yourself well know that the kingship was to have become mine, and it was toward me that all Israel had set their face for me to become king; but the kingship turned and came to be my brother’s, for it was from Jehovah that it became his.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And now there is one request that I am making of you. Do not turn my face away.” Accordingly she said to him: “Speak.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And he went on to say: “Please, say to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the king (for he will not turn your face away) that he should give me Ab&acute;i&middot;shag the Shu&acute;nam&middot;mite as a wife.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">To this Bath-she&acute;ba said: “Good! I myself shall speak for you to the king.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So Bath-she&acute;ba came in to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon to speak to him for Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah. At once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat down upon his throne and had a throne set for the mother of the king, that she might sit at his right.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And she proceeded to say: “There is one little request that I am making of you. Do not turn my face away.” So the king said to her: “Make it, my mother; for I shall not turn your face away.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And she went on to say: “Let Ab&acute;i&middot;shag the Shu&acute;nam&middot;mite be given to Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah your brother as a wife.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At this King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon answered and said to his mother: “And why are you requesting Ab&acute;i&middot;shag the Shu&acute;nam&middot;mite for Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah? Request also for him the kingship (because he is my brother older than I am), even for him and for A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest and for Jo&acute;ab the son of Ze&middot;ru&acute;iah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">With that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon swore by Jehovah, saying: “So may God do to me, and so may he add to it, if it was not against his own soul that Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah spoke this thing.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And now, as Jehovah is living who has firmly established me and keeps me seated upon the throne of David my father and who made a house for me just as he has spoken, today Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah will be put to death.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Immediately King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon sent by means of Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da; and he proceeded to fall upon him, so that he died.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And to A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar the priest the king said: “Go to An&acute;a&middot;thoth to your fields! For you are deserving of death; but on this day I shall not put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because you suffered affliction during all the time that my father suffered affliction.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So Sol&acute;o&middot;mon drove out A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar from serving as a priest of Jehovah, to fulfill Jehovah’s word that he had spoken against the house of E&acute;li in Shi&acute;loh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the report itself came clear to Jo&acute;ab—for Jo&acute;ab himself had inclined to follow Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;jah, although Ab&acute;sa&middot;lom he had not inclined to follow—and Jo&acute;ab went fleeing to the tent of Jehovah and began to hold fast to the horns of the altar.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon was told: “Jo&acute;ab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and there he is beside the altar.” So Sol&acute;o&middot;mon sent Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da, saying: “Go, fall upon him!”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Accordingly Be&middot;nai&acute;ah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him: “This is what the king has said, ‘Come on out!’” But he said: “No! For here is where I shall die.” At that Be&middot;nai&acute;ah brought word back to the king, saying: “This is what Jo&acute;ab spoke, and this is what he answered me.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then the king said to him: “Do just as he has spoken and fall upon him; and you must bury him and remove from off me and from off the house of my father the blood undeservedly shed that Jo&acute;ab spilled.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Jehovah will certainly bring back his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he was, and he proceeded to kill them with the sword, when my father David himself had not known of it, namely, Ab&acute;ner the son of Ner the chief of the army of Israel and A&middot;ma&acute;sa the son of Je&acute;ther the chief of the army of Judah.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And their blood must come back upon the head of Jo&acute;ab and upon the head of his offspring to time indefinite; but for David and for his offspring and for his house and for his throne there will come to be peace to time indefinite from Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Then Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da went on up and fell upon him and put him to death; and he got to be buried at his own house in the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Upon that the king put Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da in place of him over the army; and Za&acute;dok the priest the king put in the place of A&middot;bi&acute;a&middot;thar.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Finally the king sent and called Shim&acute;e&middot;i and said to him: “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and you must dwell there and not go out from there to this place and that.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And it must occur that on the day of your going out and when you do pass over the torrent valley of Kid&acute;ron, you should unmistakably know that you will positively die. Bloodguilt for you will itself come to be upon your own head.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">At this Shim&acute;e&middot;i said to the king: “The word is good. Just as my lord the king has spoken is the way that your servant will do.” And Shim&acute;e&middot;i kept dwelling in Jerusalem many days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And it came about at the end of three years that two slaves of Shim&acute;e&middot;i went running away to A&acute;chish the son of Ma&acute;a&middot;cah the king of Gath; and people came telling Shim&acute;e&middot;i, saying: “Look! Your slaves are at Gath.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Immediately Shim&acute;e&middot;i got up and saddled his ass and went to Gath to A&acute;chish to look for his slaves; after which Shim&acute;e&middot;i went and brought his slaves from Gath.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Then Sol&acute;o&middot;mon was told: “Shim&acute;e&middot;i has gone out of Jerusalem to Gath and is back.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">At that the king sent and called Shim&acute;e&middot;i and said to him: “Did I not put you under oath by Jehovah that I might warn you, saying, ‘On the day of your going outside and when you do go here and there you should unmistakably know that you will positively die,’ and so did you not say to me, ‘Good is the word that I have heard’?</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Why, then, did you not keep the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I solemnly laid upon you?”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And the king went on to say to Shim&acute;e&middot;i: “You yourself certainly know all the injury which your heart well knows that you did to David my father; and Jehovah will certainly return the injury by you upon your own head.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">But King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon will be blessed, and the throne of David itself will prove to be firmly established before Jehovah forever.”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">With that the king commanded Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da, who then went out and fell upon him, so that he died.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs46-2">And the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to form a marriage alliance with Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt and to take Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter and bring her to the City of David, until he finished building his own house and the house of Jehovah and Jerusalem’s wall all around.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Only the people were sacrificing on the high places, for a house had not been built to the name of Jehovah down to those days.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon continued to love Jehovah by walking in the statutes of David his father. Only it was on the high places that he was regularly sacrificing and making offerings smoke.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Accordingly the king went to Gib&acute;e&middot;on to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. A thousand burnt sacrifices Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to offer upon that altar.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In Gib&acute;e&middot;on Jehovah appeared to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in a dream by night; and God proceeded to say: “Request what I should give you.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At this Sol&acute;o&middot;mon said: “You yourself have exercised great loving-kindness toward your servant David my father according as he walked before you in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you; and you continued keeping toward him this great loving-kindness, so that you gave him a son to sit upon his throne as at this day.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And now, Jehovah my God, you yourself have made your servant king in the place of David my father, and I am but a little boy. I do not know how to go out and how to come in.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And your servant is in the middle of your people whom you have chosen, a multitudinous people that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And you must give to your servant an obedient heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this difficult people of yours?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of Jehovah, because Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had requested this thing.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And God went on to say to him: “For the reason that you have requested this thing and have not requested for yourself many days nor requested for yourself riches nor requested the soul of your enemies, and you have requested for yourself understanding to hear judicial cases,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">look! I shall certainly do according to your words. Look! I shall certainly give you a wise and understanding heart, so that one like you there has not happened to be before you, and after you there will not rise up one like you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And also what you have not requested I will give you, both riches and glory, so that there will not have happened to be any among the kings like you, all your days.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And if you will walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments, just as David your father walked, I will also lengthen your days.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When Sol&acute;o&middot;mon awoke, why, here it had been a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and rendered up communion offerings and spread a feast for all his servants.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that time two women, prostitutes, got to come in to the king and stand before him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the one woman said: “Excuse me, my lord, I and this woman are dwelling in one house, so that I gave birth close by her in the house.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And it came about on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also proceeded to give birth. And we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, no one but the two of us in the house.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Later the son of this woman died at night, because she lay upon him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your slave girl herself was asleep and laid him in her own bosom, and her dead son she laid in my bosom.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, why, there he was dead. So I examined him closely in the morning, and, look! he did not prove to be my son that I had borne.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But the other woman said: “No, but my son is the living one and your son is the dead one!” All the while this woman was saying: “No, but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one.” And they kept on speaking before the king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Finally the king said: “This one is saying, ‘This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one!’ and that one is saying, ‘No, but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one!’”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the king went on to say: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, get me a sword.” So they brought the sword before the king.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the king proceeded to say: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, sever the living child in two and give the one half to the one woman and the other half to the other.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">At once the woman whose son was the living one said to the king (for her inward emotions were excited toward her son, so that she said): “Excuse me, my lord! Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, give her the living child. Do not by any means put him to death.” All the while this other woman was saying: “Neither mine nor yours will he become. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, do the severing!”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">At that the king answered and said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, give her the living child, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must by no means put him to death. She is his mother.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And all Israel got to hear of the judicial decision that the king had handed down; and they became fearful because of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was within him to execute judicial decision.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Hi&acute;ram the king of Tyre proceeded to send his servants to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, for he had heard that it was he that they had anointed as king in place of his father; for a lover of David Hi&acute;ram had always proved to be.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">In turn Sol&acute;o&middot;mon sent to Hi&acute;ram, saying:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“You yourself well know that David my father was not able to build a house to the name of Jehovah his God because of the warfare with which they surrounded him, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And now Jehovah my God has given me rest all around. There is no resister, and there is nothing bad happening.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And here I am thinking of building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, just as Jehovah promised to David my father, saying, ‘Your son whom I shall put upon your throne in place of you, he is the one that will build the house to my name.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And now command that they cut for me cedars from Leb&acute;a&middot;non; and my servants themselves will prove to be with your servants, and the wages of your servants I shall give to you according to all that you may say, for you yourself well know that there is among us no one knowing how to cut trees like the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And it came about that as soon as Hi&acute;ram heard the words of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, he began to rejoice greatly, and he went on to say: “Blessed is Jehovah today in that he has given David a wise son over this numerous people!”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Accordingly Hi&acute;ram sent to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, saying: “I have heard what you sent to me. For my part, I shall do all your delight in the matter of timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper trees.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">My servants themselves will bring them down out of Leb&acute;a&middot;non to the sea; and I, for my part, shall put them in log rafts [to go] by sea clear to the place that you will send me notice of; and I shall certainly have them broken up there, and you, for your part, will carry them; and you, for your part, will do my delight by giving the food for my household.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So Hi&acute;ram became a giver of timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper trees to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon according to all his delight.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, for his part, gave Hi&acute;ram twenty thousand cor measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and twenty cor measures of beaten-out oil. That was what Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept giving Hi&acute;ram year by year.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jehovah, for his part, gave Sol&acute;o&middot;mon wisdom, just as he had promised him; and there came to be peace between Hi&acute;ram and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and both of them proceeded to conclude a covenant.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept bringing up those conscripted for forced labor out of all Israel; and those conscripted for forced labor amounted to thirty thousand men.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he would send them to Leb&acute;a&middot;non in shifts of ten thousand a month. For a month they would continue in Leb&acute;a&middot;non, for two months at their homes; and Ad&middot;o&middot;ni&acute;ram was over those conscripted for forced labor.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon came to have seventy thousand burden bearers and eighty thousand cutters in the mountain,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">besides Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s princely deputies who were over the work, three thousand three hundred foremen over the people who were active in the work.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Accordingly the king commanded that they should quarry great stones, expensive stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s builders and Hi&acute;ram’s builders and the Ge&acute;bal&middot;ites did the cutting, and they kept preparing the timbers and the stones to build the house.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv, that is, the second month, after Sol&acute;o&middot;mon became king over Israel, that he proceeded to build the house to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the house that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon built to Jehovah was sixty cubits in its length, and twenty in its width, and thirty cubits in its height.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the porch in front of the temple of the house was twenty cubits in its length, in front of the width of the house. Ten cubits it was in its depth, in front of the house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And for the house he went on to make windows of narrowing frames.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Further, he built against the wall of the house a side structure all around, [against] the walls of the house all around the temple and the innermost room, and made side chambers all around.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The lowest side chamber was five cubits in its width, and the middle one was six cubits in its width, and the third one was seven cubits in its width; for there were cutbacks that he gave to the house all around outside, that it might not have a hold in the walls of the house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As for the house, while it was being built, it was of quarry stone already completed that it was built; and as for hammers and axes or any tools of iron, they were not heard in the house while it was being built.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The entrance of the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house, and by a winding staircase they would go up to the middle one, and from the middle one up to the third one.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Further, he continued building the house that he might finish it, and covered in the house with beams and rows in cedarwood.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Moreover, he built the side chambers against the whole house five cubits in their height, and they had a hold on the house by timbers of cedar trees.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Meantime, the word of Jehovah came to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, saying:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“As regards this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and perform my judicial decisions and actually keep all my commandments by walking in them, I also shall certainly carry out my word with you that I spoke to David your father;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and I shall indeed reside in the middle of the sons of Israel, and I shall not leave my people Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon continued building the house that he might finish it.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to build the walls of the house inside it with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house up to the rafters of the ceiling he overlaid it with timber inside; and he went on to overlay the floor of the house with boards of juniper.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Further, he built twenty cubits at the rear sides of the house with boards of cedar, from the floor up to the rafters, and built for it inside the innermost room, the Most Holy.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it was forty cubits that the house proved to be, that is, the temple in front of it.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And [the] cedarwood on the house inside was with carvings of gourd-shaped ornaments and garlands of blossoms. All of it was cedarwood; there was no stone to be seen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the innermost room in the interior of the house he prepared inside, to put there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the innermost room was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in its height; and he proceeded to overlay it with pure gold, and to overlay the altar with cedarwood.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went on to overlay the house inside with pure gold, and to make chainwork of gold pass across in front of the innermost room, and to overlay it with gold.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was completed; and all the altar that was toward the innermost room he overlaid with gold.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Further, he made in the innermost room two cherubs of oil-tree wood, ten cubits being the height of each one.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits was the other wing of the cherub. Ten cubits it was from the tip of his wing to the tip of his wing.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the second cherub was ten cubits. The two cherubs had the same measure and the same shape.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and that was so of the other cherub.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then he put the cherubs inside the inner house, so that they spread out the wings of the cherubs. Thus the wing of the one reached to the wall and the wing of the other cherub was reaching to the other wall; and their wings were toward the middle of the house, reaching wing to wing.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Moreover, he overlaid the cherubs with gold.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And all the walls of the house round about he carved with engraved carvings of cherubs and palm-tree figures and engravings of blossoms, inside and outside;</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the entrance of the innermost room he made with doors of oil-tree wood: side pillars, doorposts [and] a fifth.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the two doors were of oil-tree wood, and he carved upon them carvings of cherubs and palm-tree figures and the engravings of blossoms, and he overlaid them with gold; and he proceeded to beat the gold down upon the cherubs and the palm-tree figures.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And that was the way he made for the entrance of the temple, the doorposts of oil-tree wood, foursquare.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And the two doors were of juniper wood. The two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And he carved cherubs and palm-tree figures and engravings of blossoms, and overlaid gold foil upon the representations.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And he went on to build the inner courtyard with three rows of hewn stone and a row of beams of cedarwood.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">In the fourth year the house of Jehovah had its foundation laid, in the lunar month of Ziv;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and in the eleventh year, in the lunar month of Bul, that is, the eighth month, the house was finished as regards all its details and all its plan; so that he was seven years at building it.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And his own house Sol&acute;o&middot;mon built in thirteen years, so that he finished all his own house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to build the House of the Forest of Leb&acute;a&middot;non a hundred cubits in its length, and fifty cubits in its width, and thirty cubits in its height, upon four rows of pillars of cedarwood; and there were beams of cedarwood upon the pillars.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it was paneled in with cedarwood above upon the girders that were upon the forty-five pillars. There were fifteen to a row.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">As for framed windows, there were three rows, and there was an illumination opening opposite an illumination opening in three tiers.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And all the entrances and the doorposts were squared [with the] frame, and also the forefront of the illumination opening opposite an illumination opening in three tiers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the Porch of Pillars he made fifty cubits in its length, and thirty cubits in its width; and another porch was in front of them with pillars and a canopy in front of them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As for the Porch of the Throne where he would do judging, he made the porch of judgment; and they covered it in with cedarwood from the floor to the rafters.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">As regards the house of his where he was to dwell, at the other courtyard, it was away from the house belonging to the Porch. It proved to be like this in workmanship. And there was a house like this Porch that he proceeded to build for Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter, whom Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had taken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">All these were [of] expensive stones according to measures, hewn, sawed with stone-saws, inside and outside, and from the foundation up to the coping, and outside as far as the great courtyard.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the expensive stones laid as a foundation were great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And up above there were expensive stones according to measures, hewn, and also cedarwood.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As for the great courtyard, round about were three rows of hewn stone and a row of beams of cedarwood; and [this] also for the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah, and for the porch of the house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to send and fetch Hi&acute;ram out of Tyre.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">He was the son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li, and his father was a Tyr&acute;i&middot;an man, a worker in copper; and he was full of the wisdom and the understanding and the knowledge for doing every sort of work in copper. Accordingly he came to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and began to do all his work.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then he cast the two pillars of copper, eighteen cubits being the height of each pillar, and a string of twelve cubits would measure around each of the two pillars.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And two capitals he made to put upon the tops of the pillars, cast in copper. Five cubits was the height of the one capital, and five cubits was the height of the other capital.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">There were nets in network, twisted ornaments in chainwork, for the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And he went on to make the pomegranates and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; and that was what he did for the other capital.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars at the porch were of lily work, of four cubits.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the capitals were upon the two pillars, also up close beside the belly that was adjoining the network; and there were two hundred pomegranates in rows all around upon each capital.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he proceeded to set up the pillars belonging to the porch of the temple. So he set up the right-hand pillar and called its name Ja&acute;chin, and then set up the left-hand pillar and called its name Bo&acute;az.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And upon the top of the pillars there was lily work. And the work of the pillars was gradually completed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he proceeded to make the molten sea ten cubits from its one brim to its other brim, circular all around; and its height was five cubits, and it took a line of thirty cubits to circle all around it.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And there were gourd-shaped ornaments down below its brim all around, encircling it, ten in a cubit, enclosing the sea all around, with two rows of the gourd-shaped ornaments cast in its casting.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">It was standing upon twelve bulls, three facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hind parts were toward the center.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was like the workmanship of the brim of a cup, a lily blossom. Two thousand bath measures were what it would contain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And he went on to make the ten carriages of copper, four cubits being the length of each carriage, and four cubits its width, and three cubits its height.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And this was the workmanship of the carriages: they had sidewalls, and the sidewalls were between the crossbars.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And upon the sidewalls that were between the crossbars there were lions, bulls and cherubs, and over the crossbars it was like that. Up above and beneath the lions and the bulls there were wreaths in hanging work.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And there were four wheels of copper to each carriage, with axles of copper; and its four cornerpieces were supports for them. Beneath the basin were the supports, cast with wreaths across from each.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And its mouth from inside to the supports and upward was [?] cubits; and its mouth was round, the workmanship of a stand of one and a half cubits, and also upon its mouth there were carvings. And their sidewalls were squared, not round.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the four wheels were down below the sidewalls, and the supports of the wheels were by the carriage; and the height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their supports and their felloes and their spokes and their hubs, they were all cast.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And there were four supports upon the four corners of each carriage; its supports were of one piece with the carriage.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And on top of the carriage there was [a stand] a half a cubit in height, circular all around; and upon the top of the carriage its sides and its sidewalls were of one piece with it.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Further, he engraved upon the plates of its sides and upon its sidewalls cherubs, lions and palm-tree figures according to the clear space of each, and wreaths all around.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">It was like this that he made the ten carriages; they all had one cast, one measure, one shape.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And he proceeded to make ten basins of copper. Forty bath measures were what each basin would contain. Each basin was four cubits. There was one basin upon each carriage for the ten carriages.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Then he put five carriages on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and the sea itself he put to the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And Hi&acute;ram gradually made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. At length Hi&acute;ram finished doing all the work that he did for King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon as respects the house of Jehovah:</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">The two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were upon the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two round capitals that were upon the top of the pillars,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates to each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were upon the two pillars;</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">and the ten carriages and the ten basins upon the carriages,</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">and the one sea and the twelve bulls beneath the sea;</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">and the cans and the shovels and the bowls and all these utensils, which Hi&acute;ram made of polished copper for King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon for the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">In the District of the Jordan it was that the king cast them in the clay mold, between Suc&acute;coth and Zar&acute;e&middot;than.</span>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon left all the utensils [unweighed] because of so extraordinarily great a quantity. The weight of the copper was not ascertained.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon gradually made all the utensils that pertained to the house of Jehovah, the altar of gold and the table on which was the showbread, of gold,</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">and the lampstands, five to the right and five to the left before the innermost room, of pure gold, and the blossoms and the lamps and the snuffers, of gold,</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">and the basins and the extinguishers and the bowls and the cups and the fire holders, of pure gold, and the sockets for the doors of the inner house, that is, the Most Holy, and for the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.</span>

       <span id="vs51">Finally all the work that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had to do as regards the house of Jehovah was at its completion; and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began to bring in the things made holy by David his father; the silver and the gold and the articles he put in the treasures of the house of Jehovah.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At that time Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to congregate the older men of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, the chieftains of the fathers, of the sons of Israel, to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the City of David, that is to say, Zion.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So all the men of Israel congregated themselves to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in the lunar month of Eth&acute;a&middot;nim in the festival, that is, the seventh month.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So all the older men of Israel came, and the priests began to carry the Ark.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And they came bringing up the ark of Jehovah and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils that were in the tent; and the priests and the Levites came bringing them up.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and with him all the assembly of Israel, those keeping their appointment with him, were before the Ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, to the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, to underneath the wings of the cherubs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For the cherubs were spreading out their wings over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs kept the Ark and its poles screened over from above.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But the poles proved to be long, so that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible outside. And there they continue down to this day.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">There was nothing in the Ark but the two stone tablets which Moses had deposited there in Ho&acute;reb, when Jehovah had covenanted with the sons of Israel while they were coming out from the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And it came about that when the priests came out from the holy place, the cloud itself filled the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the priests were unable to stand to do their ministering because of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that time Sol&acute;o&middot;mon said: “Jehovah himself said he was to reside in the thick gloom.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">I have successfully built a house of lofty abode for you, an established place for you to dwell in to time indefinite.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then the king turned his face and began to bless all the congregation of Israel, while all the congregation of Israel were standing up.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he went on to say: “Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke by his own mouth with David my father, and by his own hand has given fulfillment, saying,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">‘From the day that I brought my people Israel out from Egypt I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to continue there; but I shall choose David to come to be over my people Israel.’</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it came to be close to the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But Jehovah said to David my father, ‘For the reason that it proved to be close to your heart to build a house to my name, you did well, because it proved to be close to your heart.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Only you yourself will not build the house, but your son who is coming forth from your loins is the one that will build the house to my name.’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jehovah proceeded to carry out his word that he had spoken, that I might rise up in the place of David my father and sit upon the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah had spoken, and that I might build the house to the name of Jehovah the God of Israel,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and that I might locate a place there for the Ark where the covenant of Jehovah is that he concluded with our forefathers when he was bringing them out from the land of Egypt.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began standing before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he now spread his palms out to the heavens;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and he went on to say: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the loving-kindness toward your servants who are walking before you with all their heart,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">you who have kept toward your servant David my father that which you promised him, so that you made the promise with your own mouth, and with your own hand you have made the fulfillment, as at this day.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep toward your servant David my father that which you promised him, saying, ‘There will not be cut off a man of yours from before me to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your sons will take care of their way by walking before me just as you have walked before me.’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And now, O God of Israel, let your promise that you have promised to your servant David my father prove trustworthy, please.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“But will God truly dwell upon the earth? Look! The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, themselves cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built!</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And you must turn toward the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, to listen to the entreating cry and to the prayer with which your servant is praying before you today;</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">that your eyes may prove to be opened toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, ‘My name will prove to be there,’ to listen to the prayer with which your servant prays toward this place.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And you must listen to the request for favor on the part of your servant and of your people Israel with which they pray toward this place; and may you yourself hear at the place of your dwelling, in the heavens, and you must hear and forgive.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“When a man sins against his fellowman, and he actually lays a cursing upon him to bring him under liability to the curse, and he actually comes [within] the curse before your altar in this house,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">then may you yourself hear from the heavens, and you must act and judge your servants by pronouncing the wicked one wicked by putting his way upon his own head, and by pronouncing the righteous one righteous by giving to him according to his own righteousness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy, because they kept sinning against you, and they indeed return to you and laud your name and pray and make request for favor toward you in this house,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">then may you yourself hear from heaven, and you must forgive the sin of your people Israel and you must bring them back to the ground that you gave to their forefathers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“When heaven is shut up so that no rain occurs, because they kept sinning against you, and they actually pray toward this place and laud your name, and from their sin they turn back, because you kept afflicting them,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">then may you yourself hear from the heavens, and you must forgive the sin of your servants, even of your people Israel, because you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and you must give rain upon your land that you have given to your people as a hereditary possession.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“In case a famine occurs in the land, in case a pestilence occurs, in case scorching, mildew, locusts, cockroaches occur; in case their enemy besieges them in the land of their gates—any sort of plague, any sort of malady—</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">whatever prayer, whatever request for favor there may occur on the part of any man [or] of all your people Israel, because they know each one the plague of his own heart, and they actually spread out their palms to this house,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">then may you yourself hear from the heavens, your established place of dwelling, and you must forgive and act and give to each one according to all his ways, because you know his heart (for you yourself alone well know the heart of all the sons of mankind);</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">to the end that they may fear you all the days that they are alive upon the surface of the ground that you gave to our forefathers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“And also to the foreigner, who is no part of your people Israel and who actually comes from a distant land by reason of your name</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">(for they shall hear of your great name and of your strong hand and of your stretched-out arm), and he actually comes and prays toward this house,</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">may you yourself listen from the heavens, your established place of dwelling, and you must do according to all that for which the foreigner calls to you; in order that all the peoples of the earth may get to know your name so as to fear you the same as your people Israel do, and so as to know that your name itself has been called upon this house that I have built.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“In case your people go out to the war against their enemy in the way that you send them, and they indeed pray to Jehovah in the direction of the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built to your name,</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">you must also hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor, and you must execute judgment for them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">“In case they sin against you (for there is no man that does not sin), and you have to be incensed at them and abandon them to the enemy, and their captors actually carry them off captive to the land of the enemy distant or nearby;</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">and they indeed come to their senses in the land where they have been carried off captive, and they actually return and make request to you for favor in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and erred, we have acted wickedly’;</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">and they indeed return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive, and they indeed pray to you in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers, the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built to your name;</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">you must also hear from the heavens, your established place of dwelling, their prayer and their request for favor, and you must execute judgment for them,</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">and you must forgive your people who had sinned against you and all their transgressions with which they transgressed against you; and you must make them objects of pity before their captors and they must pity them</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">(for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out from Egypt, from inside the iron furnace),</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">that your eyes may prove to be opened to the request for favor of your servant and to the request for favor of your people Israel, by listening to them in all for which they call to you.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">For you yourself separated them as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth, just as you have spoken by means of Moses your servant when you were bringing our forefathers out from Egypt, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">And it came about that, as soon as Sol&acute;o&middot;mon finished praying to Jehovah with all this prayer and request for favor, he rose up from before the altar of Jehovah, from bending down upon his knees with his palms spread out to the heavens;</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">and he began to stand and bless all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">“Blessed be Jehovah, who has given a resting-place to his people Israel according to all that he has promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise that he has promised by means of Moses his servant.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">May Jehovah our God prove to be with us just as he proved to be with our forefathers. May he neither leave us nor forsake us,</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">so as to incline our heart to himself to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his regulations and his judicial decisions, which he gave in command to our forefathers.</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">And may these words of mine with which I have made request for favor before Jehovah prove to be near to Jehovah our God by day and night, that he may execute judgment for his servant and judgment for his people Israel as it may require day by day;</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">to the end that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is the [true] God. There is no other.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart must prove to be complete with Jehovah our God by walking in his regulations and by keeping his commandments as at this day.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">And the king and all Israel with him were offering a grand sacrifice before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to offer the communion sacrifices that he had to offer to Jehovah, twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep, that the king and all the sons of Israel might inaugurate the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">On that day the king had to sanctify the middle of the courtyard that is before the house of Jehovah, because there he had to render up the burnt sacrifice and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices; for the copper altar that is before Jehovah was too small to contain the burnt sacrifice and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices.</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to carry on at that time the festival, and all Israel with him, a great congregation from the entering in of Ha&acute;math down to the torrent valley of Egypt, before Jehovah our God seven days and another seven days, fourteen days.</span> <a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they began to bless the king and to go to their homes, rejoicing and feeling merry of heart over all the goodness that Jehovah had performed for David his servant and for Israel his people.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about that, as soon as Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had finished building the house of Jehovah and the house of the king and every desirable thing of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon that he took delight in making,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">then Jehovah appeared to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the second time, the same as he had appeared to him in Gib&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Jehovah went on to say to him: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor with which you requested favor before me. I have sanctified this house that you have built by putting my name there to time indefinite; and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you, if you will walk before me, just as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and with uprightness by doing according to all that I have commanded you, and you will keep my regulations and my judicial decisions,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">I also shall indeed establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel to time indefinite, just as I promised David your father, saying, ‘Not a man of yours will be cut off from [sitting] upon the throne of Israel.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons should definitely turn back from following me and not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> actually go and serve other gods and bow down to them,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">I will also cut Israel off from upon the surface of the ground that I have given to them; and the house that I have sanctified to my name I shall throw away from before me, and Israel will indeed become a proverbial saying and a taunt among all the peoples.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And this house itself will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will certainly whistle and say, ‘For what reason did Jehovah do like that to this land and this house?’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And they will have to say, ‘For the reason that they left Jehovah their God who had brought their forefathers out from the land of Egypt, and they proceeded to take hold of other gods and bow down to them and serve them. That is why Jehovah brought upon them all this calamity.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And it came about at the end of twenty years, in which Sol&acute;o&middot;mon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">(Hi&acute;ram the king of Tyre had himself assisted Sol&acute;o&middot;mon with timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper trees and with gold as much as he delighted in,) that at that time King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to give to Hi&acute;ram twenty cities in the land of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Accordingly Hi&acute;ram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had given him, and they were not just right in his eyes.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So he said: “What sort of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” And they came to be called the Land of Ca&acute;bul down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">In the meantime Hi&acute;ram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now this is the account of those conscripted for forced labor that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon levied to build the house of Jehovah and his own house and the Mound and the wall of Jerusalem and Ha&acute;zor and Me&middot;gid&acute;do and Ge&acute;zer.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">(Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt himself had come up and then captured Ge&acute;zer and burned it with fire, and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites dwelling in the city he had killed. So he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter, the wife of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.)</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went on to build Ge&acute;zer and Lower Beth-ho&acute;ron,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and Ba&acute;al&middot;ath and Ta&acute;mar in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and all the storage cities that became Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s and the chariot cities and the cities for the horsemen, and the desirable things of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon that he had desired to build in Jerusalem and in Leb&acute;a&middot;non and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for all the people remaining over from the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, the Hit&acute;tites, the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites, the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites, who were no part of the sons of Israel,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">their sons who had been left over after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had been unable to devote to destruction, Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept levying them for slavish forced labor until this day.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And there were none of the sons of Israel that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon constituted slaves; for they were the warriors and his servants and his princes and his adjutants and chiefs of his charioteers and of his horsemen.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">These were the chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, five hundred and fifty, the foremen over the people who were active in the work.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter herself came up out of the City of David to her own house that he had built for her. It was then that he built the Mound.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon continued three times in the year to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices upon the altar that he had built for Jehovah, and there was a making of sacrificial smoke on the [altar], which was before Jehovah; and he completed the house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And there was a fleet of ships that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon made in E&acute;zi&middot;on-ge&acute;ber, which is by E&acute;loth, upon the shore of the Red Sea in the land of E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And Hi&acute;ram kept sending in the fleet of ships his own servants, seamen, having a knowledge of the sea, along with the servants of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And they proceeded to go to O&acute;phir and take from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold and bring it in to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now the queen of She&acute;ba was hearing the report about Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in connection with the name of Jehovah. So she came to test him with perplexing questions.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Finally she arrived at Jerusalem with a very impressive train, camels carrying balsam oil and very much gold and precious stones; and she came on in to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and began to speak to him all that happened to be close to her heart.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, in turn, went on to tell her all her matters. There proved to be no matter hidden from the king that he did not tell her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When the queen of She&acute;ba got to see all the wisdom of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and the house that he had built,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the table service of his waiters and their attire and his drinks and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, then there proved to be no more spirit in her.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So she said to the king: “True has the word proved to be that I heard in my own land about your matters and about your wisdom.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I did not put faith in the words until I had come that my own eyes might see; and, look! I had not been told the half. You have surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the things heard to which I listened.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Happy are your men; happy are these servants of yours who are standing before you constantly, listening to your wisdom!</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">May Jehovah your God come to be blessed, who has taken delight in you by putting you upon the throne of Israel; because Jehovah loves Israel to time indefinite, so that he appointed you as king to render judicial decision and righteousness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great deal of balsam oil and precious stones. There never came anymore the like of that balsam oil for quantity such as the queen of She&acute;ba gave to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Hi&acute;ram’s fleet of ships that carried gold from O&acute;phir also brought from O&acute;phir timbers of algum trees in very great amount and precious stones.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the king proceeded to make out of the timbers of the algum trees supports for the house of Jehovah and for the house of the king, and also harps and stringed instruments for the singers. Timbers of algum trees like this have not come in nor have they been seen down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon himself gave the queen of She&acute;ba all her delight for which she asked, apart from what he gave her according to the openhandedness of King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon. After that she turned about and went to her own land, she together with her servants.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the weight of the gold that came to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in one year amounted up to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">apart from the men of travel and the profit from the traders and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went on to make two hundred large shields of alloyed gold (six hundred [shekels] of gold he proceeded to lay upon each large shield),</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and three hundred bucklers of alloyed gold (three mi&acute;nas of gold he proceeded to lay upon each buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Leb&acute;a&middot;non.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Further, the king made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with refined gold.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">There were six steps to the throne, and the throne had a round canopy behind it, and there were armrests on this side and on that side by the place of sitting, and two lions were standing beside the armrests.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And there were twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, on this side and on that side. No other kingdom had any made just like it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And all the drinking vessels of King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Leb&acute;a&middot;non were of pure gold. There was nothing of silver; it was considered in the days of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon as nothing at all.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For the king had a fleet of ships of Tar&acute;shish on the sea along with Hi&acute;ram’s fleet of ships. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tar&acute;shish would come carrying gold and silver, ivory, and apes and peacocks.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And all the people of the earth were seeking the face of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And they were bringing each his gift, articles of silver and articles of gold and garments and armor and balsam oil, horses and mules, as a yearly matter of course.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept gathering more chariots and steeds; and he came to have a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand steeds, and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the king came to make the silver in Jerusalem like the stones, and cedarwood he made like the sycamore trees that are in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah for great quantity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And there was the export of the horses that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had from Egypt, and the company of the king’s merchants would themselves take the horse drove for a price.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And a chariot customarily came up and was exported from Egypt for six hundred silver pieces, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and that was the way it was for all the kings of the Hit&acute;tites and the kings of Syria. It was by means of them that they did the exporting.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon himself loved many foreign wives along with the daughter of Phar&acute;aoh, Mo&acute;ab&middot;ite, Am&acute;mon&middot;ite, E&acute;dom&middot;ite, Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;an [and] Hit&acute;tite women,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">from the nations of whom Jehovah had said to the sons of Israel: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not go in among them, and they themselves should not come in among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; truly they will incline <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart to follow their gods.” It was to them that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon clung to love [them].</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he came to have seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives gradually inclined his heart.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And it came about in the time of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s growing old that his wives themselves had inclined his heart to follow other gods; and his heart did not prove to be complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began going after Ash&acute;to&middot;reth the goddess of the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans and after Mil&acute;com the disgusting thing of the Am&acute;mon&middot;ites.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not follow Jehovah fully like David his father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It was then that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to build a high place to Che&acute;mosh the disgusting thing of Mo&acute;ab on the mountain that was in front of Jerusalem, and to Mo&acute;lech the disgusting thing of the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And that was the way he did for all his foreign wives who were making sacrificial smoke and sacrificing to their gods.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah came to be incensed at Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel, the one appearing to him twice.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And respecting this thing he commanded him not to go after other gods; but he had not kept that which Jehovah had commanded.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jehovah now said to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon: “For the reason that this has taken place with you and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I laid in command upon you, I shall without fail rip the kingdom away from off you, and I shall certainly give it to your servant.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">However, in your days I shall not do it, for the sake of David your father. Out of the hand of your son I shall rip it away.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Only it will not be all the kingdom that I shall rip away. One tribe I shall give to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah began to raise up a resister to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, namely, Ha&acute;dad the E&acute;dom&middot;ite of the offspring of the king. He was in E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it came about when David struck down E&acute;dom, when Jo&acute;ab the chief of the army came up to bury those slain, that he tried to strike down every male in E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">(For it was six months that Jo&acute;ab and all Israel dwelt there until he had cut off every male in E&acute;dom.)</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Ha&acute;dad went running away, he and some E&acute;dom&middot;ite men of the servants of his father with him, to come into Egypt, while Ha&acute;dad was a young boy.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So they rose up out of Mid&acute;i&middot;an and came into Pa&acute;ran and took men with them from Pa&acute;ran and came into Egypt to Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt, who then gave him a house. Also, bread he assigned to him, and land he gave him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Ha&acute;dad continued to find favor in the eyes of Phar&acute;aoh, so much that he gave him a wife, the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tah&acute;pe&middot;nes the lady.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">In time the sister of Tah&acute;pe&middot;nes bore him Ge&middot;nu&acute;bath his son, and Tah&acute;pe&middot;nes got to wean him right inside the house of Phar&acute;aoh; and Ge&middot;nu&acute;bath continued at the house of Phar&acute;aoh right among the sons of Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Ha&acute;dad himself heard in Egypt that David had lain down with his forefathers and that Jo&acute;ab the chief of the army had died. So Ha&acute;dad said to Phar&acute;aoh: “Send me away, that I may go to my own land.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But Phar&acute;aoh said to him: “What are you in need of while with me that here you are seeking to go to your own land?” To this he said: “Nothing; but you ought to send me away without fail.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And God proceeded to raise up to him another resister, namely, Re&acute;zon the son of E&middot;li&acute;a&middot;da, who had run away from Had&middot;ad&middot;e&acute;zer the king of Zo&acute;bah his lord.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he kept collecting men to his side and came to be chief of a marauder band, when David killed them. So they went to Damascus and took up dwelling in it and began reigning in Damascus.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And he came to be a resister of Israel all the days of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and that along with the injury that Ha&acute;dad did; and he had an abhorrence of Israel while he continued reigning over Syria.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And there was Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat an E&acute;phra&middot;im&middot;ite from Zer&acute;e&middot;dah, a servant of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and his mother’s name was Ze&middot;ru&acute;ah, a widowed woman. He too began to lift up his hand against the king.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And this is the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Sol&acute;o&middot;mon himself had built the Mound. He had closed up the gap of the City of David his father.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Now the man Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am was a valiant, mighty man. When Sol&acute;o&middot;mon got to see that the young man was a hard worker, he proceeded to make him overseer over all the compulsory service of the house of Joseph.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about at that particular time that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am himself went out from Jerusalem, and A&middot;hi&acute;jah the Shi&acute;lo&middot;nite the prophet got to find him on the road, and [A&middot;hi&acute;jah] was covering himself with a new garment; and the two of them were by themselves in the field.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">A&middot;hi&acute;jah now took hold of the new garment that was on him and ripped it into twelve pieces.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And he went on to say to Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs31-2">“Take for yourself ten pieces; for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Here I am ripping the kingdom out of the hand of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and I shall certainly give you ten tribes.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the one tribe is what will continue his for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">The reason why is that they have left me and begun to bow down to Ash&acute;to&middot;reth the goddess of the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans, to Che&acute;mosh the god of Mo&acute;ab and to Mil&acute;com the god of the sons of Am&acute;mon; and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and my statutes and my judicial decisions like David his father.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">But I shall not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, because a chieftain I shall set him for all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And I shall certainly take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you, even ten tribes.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And to his son I shall give one tribe, in order that David my servant may continue having a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And you are the one that I shall take, and you will indeed reign over all that your soul craves, and you will certainly become king over Israel.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And it must occur that, if you obey all that I shall command you, and you do walk in my ways and actually do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, just as David my servant did, I will also prove to be with you, and I will build you a lasting house, just as I have built for David, and I will give you Israel.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And I shall humiliate the offspring of David on account of this, only not always.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began seeking to put Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am to death. So Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am got up and went running off to Egypt to Shi&acute;shak the king of Egypt, and he continued in Egypt until Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s death.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">As for the rest of the affairs of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and all that he did and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the affairs of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon?</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And the days that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Then Sol&acute;o&middot;mon lay down with his forefathers, and was buried in the City of David his father; and Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am proceeded to go to She&acute;chem, for it was to She&acute;chem that all Israel came to make him king.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it came about that as soon as Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat heard of it while he was yet in Egypt (because he had run off on account of King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am might dwell in Egypt),</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">then they sent and called him. After that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all the congregation of Israel came and began to speak to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Your father, for his part, made our yoke hard, and, as for you, now make the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us lighter, and we shall serve you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this he said to them: “Go away for three days and return to me.” So the people went away.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am began to take counsel with the older men who had continued attending upon Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his father while he continued alive, saying: “How are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> advising to reply to this people?”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Accordingly they spoke to him, saying: “If today you would prove yourself a servant to this people and actually serve them, you must also answer them and speak to them with good words; and they will be bound to become your servants always.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">However, he left the counsel of the older men with which they had advised him, and he began to take counsel with the young men that had grown up with him, who were the ones attending upon him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he went on to say to them: “What is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are offering in counsel that we may reply to this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put upon us lighter’?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In turn the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying: “This is what you should say to this people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father, for his part, made our yoke heavy, but, as for you, make it lighter upon us’; this is what you should speak to them, ‘My little finger itself will certainly be thicker than my father’s hips.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now my father, for his part, loaded upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a heavy yoke; but I, for my part, shall add to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> yoke. My father, for his part, chastised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with whips, but I, for my part, shall chastise <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with scourges.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all the people proceeded to come to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am on the third day, just as the king had spoken, saying: “Return to me on the third day.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the king began to answer the people harshly, and to leave the counsel of the older men who had counseled him.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he went on to speak to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: “My father, for his part, made <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> yoke heavy, but I, for my part, shall add to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> yoke. My father, for his part, chastised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with whips, but I, for my part, shall chastise <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with scourges.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the king did not listen to the people, because the turn of affairs took place at the instance of Jehovah, in order that he might indeed carry out his word that Jehovah had spoken by means of A&middot;hi&acute;jah the Shi&acute;lo&middot;nite to Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When all Israel got to see that the king had not listened to them, then the people replied to the king, saying: “What share do we have in David? And there is no inheritance in the son of Jes&acute;se. To your gods, O Israel. Now see to your own house, O David!” With that Israel began to go to their tents.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As for the sons of Israel that were dwelling in the cities of Judah, Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am continued to reign over them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Subsequently King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am sent A&middot;do&acute;ram, who was over those conscripted for forced labor, but all Israel pelted him with stones, so that he died. And King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am himself managed to get up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the Israelites kept up their revolt against the house of David down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And it came about that as soon as all Israel heard that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am had returned, they at once sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None became a follower of the house of David except the tribe of Judah by itself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am arrived at Jerusalem, he immediately congregated all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand choice men able-bodied for war, to fight against the house of Israel, so as to bring the kingship back to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then the word of the [true] God came to She&middot;mai&acute;ah the man of the [true] God, saying:</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“Say to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not go up and fight against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers the sons of Israel. Go back each one to his house, for it is at the instance of myself that this thing has been brought about.”’” So they obeyed the word of Jehovah, and went back home according to the word of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am proceeded to build She&acute;chem in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im and to dwell in it. Then he went forth from there and built Pe&middot;nu&acute;el.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am began to say in his heart: “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">If this people continues going up to render sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, the heart of this people will also be bound to return to their lord, Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the king of Judah; and they will certainly kill me and return to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the king of Judah.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Consequently the king took counsel and made two golden calves and said to the people: “It is too much for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then he placed the one in Beth&acute;el, and the other he put in Dan.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And this thing came to be a cause for sin, and the people began to go before the one as far as Dan.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And he began to make a house of high places and to make priests from the people in general, who did not happen to be of the sons of Le&acute;vi.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am went on to make a festival in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival that was in Judah, that he might make offerings upon the altar that he had made in Beth&acute;el, to sacrifice to the calves that he had made; and he put in attendance at Beth&acute;el the priests of the high places that he had made.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And he began to make offerings upon the altar that he had made in Beth&acute;el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had invented by himself; and he proceeded to make a festival for the sons of Israel and to make offerings upon the altar to make sacrificial smoke.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And here there was a man of God that had come out of Judah by the word of Jehovah to Beth&acute;el, while Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am was standing by the altar to make sacrificial smoke.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he called out against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said: “O altar, altar, this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Look! A son born to the house of David, whose name is Jo&middot;si&acute;ah! And he will certainly sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places that are making sacrificial smoke upon you, and men’s bones he will burn upon you.’”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he gave a portent on that day, saying: “This is the portent of which Jehovah has spoken: Look! The altar is ripped apart, and the fatty ashes that are upon it will certainly be spilled out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And it came about that, as soon as the king heard the word of the man of the [true] God that he had called out against the altar in Beth&acute;el, Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am at once thrust out his hand from off the altar, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, grab hold of him!” Immediately his hand that he had thrust out against him became dried up, and he was not able to draw it back to himself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the altar itself was ripped apart so that the fatty ashes were spilled out from the altar, according to the portent that the man of the [true] God had given by the word of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The king now answered and said to the man of the [true] God: “Soften, please, the face of Jehovah your God and pray in my behalf that my hand may be restored to me.” At this the man of the [true] God softened the face of Jehovah, so that the king’s hand was restored to him, and it came to be as at first.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the king went on to say to the man of the [true] God: “Do come with me to the house and take sustenance, and let me give you a gift.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But the man of the [true] God said to the king: “If you gave me half of your house I would not come with you and eat bread or drink water in this place.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For that is the way he commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, ‘You must not eat bread or drink water, and you must not return by the way that you went.’”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And he began to go by another way, and he did not return by the way by which he had come to Beth&acute;el.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And a certain old prophet was dwelling in Beth&acute;el, and his sons now came in and related to him all the work that the man of the [true] God had done that day in Beth&acute;el [and] the words that he had spoken to the king, and they went on relating them to their father.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then their father spoke to them: “Which way, then, did he go?” So his sons showed him the way that the man of the [true] God that had come out of Judah had gone.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">He now said to his sons: “Saddle the ass for me.” Accordingly they saddled the ass for him, and he went riding on it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he went following the man of the [true] God and got to find him sitting under the big tree. Then he said to him: “Are you the man of the [true] God who has come out of Judah?” to which he said: “I am.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he went on to say to him: “Go with me to the house and eat bread.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But he said: “I am not able to go back with you or to come in with you, and I may not eat bread or drink water with you in this place.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For it has been spoken to me by the word of Jehovah, ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there. You must not go back again by the way by which you went.’”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At this he said to him: “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel himself spoke to me by the word of Jehovah, saying, ‘Have him come back with you to your house that he may eat bread and drink water.’” (He deceived him.)</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So he went back with him that he might eat bread in his house and drink water.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And it came about, while they were sitting at the table, that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet that had brought him back;</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and he began to call out to the man of the [true] God that had come out of Judah, saying: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that you rebelled against the order of Jehovah and did not keep the commandment with which Jehovah your God commanded you,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">but you went back that you might eat bread and drink water in the place about which he spoke to you: “Do not eat bread or drink water,” your dead body will not come into the burial place of your forefathers.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And it came about after his eating bread and after his drinking that he at once saddled for him the ass, that is, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he got on his way. Later a lion found him on the road and put him to death, and his dead body came to be thrown onto the road. And the ass was standing beside it, and the lion was standing beside the dead body.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And here there were men passing by, so that they got to see the dead body thrown onto the road and the lion standing beside the dead body. Then they came in and spoke of it in the city in which the old prophet was dwelling.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">When the prophet that had brought him back from the way heard of it, he immediately said: “It is the man of the [true] God that rebelled against the order of Jehovah; and so Jehovah gave him to the lion, that he might crush him and put him to death, according to the word of Jehovah that he spoke to him.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And he went on to speak to his sons, saying: “Saddle the ass for me.” So they saddled it.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then he got on his way and found the dead body of him thrown onto the road with the ass and the lion standing beside the dead body. The lion had not eaten the dead body, nor had it crushed the ass.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the prophet proceeded to lift up the dead body of the man of the [true] God and to deposit him upon the ass and to bring him back. Thus he came into the city of the old prophet to bewail and bury him.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Accordingly he deposited his dead body in his own burial place; and they kept wailing over him: “Too bad, my brother!”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And it came about after his burying him that he went on to say to his sons: “When I die <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must bury me in the burial place in which the man of the [true] God is buried. Beside his bones deposit my own bones.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For without fail the word that he called out by the word of Jehovah against the altar that is in Beth&acute;el and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a will take place.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">After this thing Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am did not turn back from his bad way, but he again went making priests of high places from the people in general. As for anyone delighting in it, he would fill his hand with power, [saying]: “And let him become [one of the] priests of high places.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And in this thing there came to be a cause of sin on the part of the household of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and an occasion for effacing them and annihilating them off the surface of the ground.</span>

       <span id="vs1">At that particular time A&middot;bi&acute;jah the son of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am fell sick.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am said to his wife: “Rise up, please, and you must disguise yourself that they may not know that you are the wife of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, and you must go to Shi&acute;loh. Look! There is where A&middot;hi&acute;jah the prophet is. He is the one that spoke with reference to me as to becoming king over this people.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you must take in your hand ten loaves of bread and sprinkled cakes and a flask of honey, and you must come in to him. He it is that will certainly tell you what is going to happen to the boy.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the wife of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am proceeded to do so. Consequently she rose up and went to Shi&acute;loh and came to the house of A&middot;hi&acute;jah. Now A&middot;hi&acute;jah himself was unable to see, for his eyes had set because of his age.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jehovah himself had said to A&middot;hi&acute;jah: “Here is the wife of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am coming to apply for a word from you regarding her son; for he is sick. This way and that is how you should speak to her. And it will occur that as soon as she arrives, she will be making herself unrecognizable.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And it came about that as soon as A&middot;hi&acute;jah heard the sound of her feet as she was coming into the entrance, he began to say: “Come in, you wife of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am. Why is it that you are making yourself unrecognizable while I am being sent to you with a severe message?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Go, say to Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said: “For the reason that I raised you up out of the middle of your people, that I might constitute you a leader over my people Israel,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and I went on to rip the kingdom away from the house of David and give it to you, and you have not become like my servant David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart by doing only what was right in my eyes,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">but you began to act worse than all those who happened to be prior to you, and you went and made for yourself another god and molten images to offend me, and it is I whom you have cast behind your back;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">for that reason here I am bringing calamity upon the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, and I shall certainly cut off from Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am anyone urinating against a wall, a helpless and worthless one in Israel; and I shall indeed make a clean sweep behind the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, just as one clears away the dung until it is disposed of.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The one dying of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am’s in the city, the dogs will eat; and the one dying in the field, the fowls of the heavens will eat, because Jehovah himself has spoken it.”’</span>

       <span id="vs12">“And you yourself, rise up, go to your house. When your feet come into the city the child will certainly die.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And all Israel will indeed bewail him and bury him, because this one alone of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am’s will come into a burial place; for the reason that something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel has been found in him in the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah will certainly raise up to himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the said day, and what if right now?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Jehovah will indeed strike Israel down, just as the reed sways in the water; and he will certainly uproot Israel off this good ground that he gave to their forefathers, and he will indeed scatter them beyond the River, for the reason that they made their sacred poles, so offending Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he will give Israel up on account of the sins of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am with which he sinned and with which he caused Israel to sin.”</span>

       <span id="vs17">At that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am’s wife rose up and went her way and came to Tir&acute;zah. As she was arriving at the threshold of the house, the boy himself died.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So they buried him, and all Israel went wailing for him, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken by means of his servant A&middot;hi&acute;jah the prophet.</span>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs20">And the days that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am reigned were twenty-two years, after which he lay down with his forefathers; and Na&acute;dab his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">As for Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, he had become king in Judah. Forty-one years old Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am was when he began to reign, and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Na&acute;a&middot;mah the Am&acute;mon&middot;it&middot;ess.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Judah went on doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, so that they incited him to jealousy more than all that their forefathers had done by their sins with which they sinned.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And they too kept building for themselves high places and sacred pillars and sacred poles upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And even the male temple prostitute proved to be in the land. They acted according to all the detestable things of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And it came about in the fifth year of King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am that Shi&acute;shak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he got to take the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the house of the king; and everything he took. And he went on to take all the gold shields that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had made.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Consequently King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am made in place of them copper shields, and he committed them to the control of the chiefs of the runners, the guards of the entrance of the king’s house.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And it would occur that as often as the king came to the house of Jehovah, the runners would carry them, and they returned them to the guard chamber of the runners.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the rest of the affairs of Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the times of the kings of Judah?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And warfare itself took place between Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am and Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am always.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Finally Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am lay down with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David. And his mother’s name was Na&acute;a&middot;mah the Am&acute;mon&middot;it&middot;ess. And A&middot;bi&acute;jam his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs13">As for even Ma&acute;a&middot;cah his grandmother, he went on to remove her from [being] lady, because she had made a horrible idol to the sacred pole; after which A&acute;sa cut down her horrible idol and burned it at the torrent valley of Kid&acute;ron.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the high places he did not remove. Nevertheless, A&acute;sa’s heart itself proved to be complete with Jehovah all his days.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he began to bring in the things made holy by his father and the things made holy by himself into the house of Jehovah, silver and gold and articles.</span>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And warfare itself took place between A&acute;sa and Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the king of Israel all their days.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the king of Israel came up against Judah and began to build Ra&acute;mah, to allow no one to go out or come in to A&acute;sa the king of Judah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that A&acute;sa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the house of the king and put them in the hand of his servants; and King A&acute;sa now sent them to Ben-ha&acute;dad the son of Tab&middot;rim&acute;mon the son of He&acute;zi&middot;on, the king of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying:</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs20">Accordingly Ben-ha&acute;dad listened to King A&acute;sa and sent the chiefs of the military forces that were his against the cities of Israel and went striking down I&acute;jon and Dan and A&acute;bel-beth-ma&acute;a&middot;cah and all Chin&acute;ne&middot;reth, as far as all the land of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And it came about that as soon as Ba&acute;a&middot;sha heard of it, he immediately quit building Ra&acute;mah and continued dwelling in Tir&acute;zah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And King A&acute;sa, for his part, summoned all Judah—there was none exempt—and they proceeded to carry the stones of Ra&acute;mah and the timbers of it, with which Ba&acute;a&middot;sha had been building; and King A&acute;sa began to build with them Ge&acute;ba in Benjamin, and Miz&acute;pah.</span>

Only at the time of his growing old he got diseased in his feet.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Finally A&acute;sa lay down with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather; and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">As for Na&acute;dab the son of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, he became king over Israel in the second year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah; and he continued to reign over Israel two years.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and went on walking in the way of his father and in his sin with which he caused Israel to sin.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the son of A&middot;hi&acute;jah of the house of Is&acute;sa&middot;char began to conspire against him; and Ba&acute;a&middot;sha got to strike him down at Gib&acute;be&middot;thon, which belonged to the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, while Na&acute;dab and all Israel were besieging Gib&acute;be&middot;thon.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So Ba&acute;a&middot;sha put him to death in the third year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah and began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about that as soon as he became king, he struck down all the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am. He did not let anyone breathing remain of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am’s until he had annihilated them, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken by means of his servant A&middot;hi&acute;jah the Shi&acute;lo&middot;nite,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">on account of the sins of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am with which he sinned and with which he caused Israel to sin [and] by his offensiveness with which he offended Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>

       <span id="vs34">And he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and went walking in the way of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and in his sin with which he caused Israel to sin.</span>

       <span id="vs6">Finally Ba&acute;a&middot;sha lay down with his forefathers and was buried in Tir&acute;zah; and E&acute;lah his son began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And also by means of Je&acute;hu the son of Ha&middot;na&acute;ni the prophet, Jehovah’s word itself had come against Ba&acute;a&middot;sha and his house, both because of all the badness that he committed in the eyes of Jehovah by offending him with the work of his hands, that it might become like the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, and because he struck him down.</span>

       <span id="vs8">In the twenty-sixth year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah, E&acute;lah the son of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha became king over Israel in Tir&acute;zah for two years.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And his servant Zim&acute;ri the chief of half the chariots began to conspire against him, while he was in Tir&acute;zah drinking himself drunk at the house of Ar&acute;za, who was over the household in Tir&acute;zah.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Zim&acute;ri proceeded to come in and strike him down and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah, and he began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about that when he began to reign, as soon as he sat down upon his throne, he struck down all the house of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha. He did not let anyone of his remain that urinates against a wall or his avengers of blood or his friends.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Thus Zim&acute;ri annihilated the whole house of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha, according to the word of Jehovah that he had spoken against Ba&acute;a&middot;sha by means of Je&acute;hu the prophet,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">on account of all the sins of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha and the sins of E&acute;lah his son with which they sinned and with which they caused Israel to sin by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their vain idols.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">As for the rest of the affairs of E&acute;lah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel?</span>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In the twenty-seventh year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah, Zim&acute;ri became king for seven days in Tir&acute;zah, while the people were encamping against Gib&acute;be&middot;thon, which belonged to the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In time the people that were encamped heard it said: “Zim&acute;ri has conspired and also struck down the king.” So all Israel made Om&acute;ri, the chief of the army, king over Israel on that day in the camp.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Om&acute;ri and all Israel with him now went on up from Gib&acute;be&middot;thon and began to lay siege to Tir&acute;zah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And it came about that as soon as Zim&acute;ri saw that the city had been captured, he then came into the dwelling tower of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over himself with fire, so that he died,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">for the sins of his with which he had sinned by doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah by walking in the way of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and in his sin which he did by causing Israel to sin.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for the rest of the affairs of Zim&acute;ri and his conspiracy with which he conspired, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">It was then that the people of Israel began to divide themselves into two parts. There was one part of the people that became followers of Tib&acute;ni the son of Gi&acute;nath, to make him king, and the other part followers of Om&acute;ri.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally the people that were following Om&acute;ri overcame the people that were following Tib&acute;ni the son of Gi&acute;nath; so that Tib&acute;ni met death, and Om&acute;ri began to reign.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In the thirty-first year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah, Om&acute;ri became king over Israel for twelve years. In Tir&acute;zah he reigned six years.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he proceeded to buy the mountain of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a from She&acute;mer for two talents of silver, and began to build [on] the mountain and call the name of the city that he built by the name of She&acute;mer the master of the mountain, Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Om&acute;ri kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and came to do worse than all who were prior to him.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he went walking in all the way of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat and in his sin with which he caused Israel to sin by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their vain idols.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">As for the rest of the affairs of Om&acute;ri, what he did and his mightiness with which he acted, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Finally Om&acute;ri lay down with his forefathers and was buried in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a; and A&acute;hab his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And as for A&acute;hab the son of Om&acute;ri, he became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of A&acute;sa the king of Judah; and A&acute;hab the son of Om&acute;ri continued to reign over Israel in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a twenty-two years.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And A&acute;hab the son of Om&acute;ri proceeded to do worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those who were prior to him.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And it came about that, [as if it were] the most trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat, he now took as wife Jez&acute;e&middot;bel the daughter of Eth&middot;ba&acute;al the king of the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans and began to go and serve Ba&acute;al and to bow down to him.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Further, he set up an altar to Ba&acute;al at the house of Ba&acute;al that he built in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And A&acute;hab went on to make the sacred pole; and A&acute;hab came to do more to offend Jehovah the God of Israel than all the kings of Israel that happened to be prior to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">In his days Hi&acute;el the Beth&acute;el&middot;ite built Jer&acute;i&middot;cho. At the forfeit of A&middot;bi&acute;ram his firstborn he laid the foundation of it, and at the forfeit of Se&acute;gub his youngest he put up its doors, according to Jehovah’s word that he spoke by means of Joshua the son of Nun.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And E&middot;li&acute;jah the Tish&acute;bite from the inhabitants of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad proceeded to say to A&acute;hab: “As Jehovah the God of Israel before whom I do stand is living, there will occur during these years neither dew nor rain, except at the order of my word!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">The word of Jehovah now came to him, saying:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“Go away from here, and you must turn your way eastward and conceal yourself at the torrent valley of Che&acute;rith that is east of the Jordan.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And it must occur that from the torrent valley you should drink, and the ravens I shall certainly command to supply you food there.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Immediately he went and did according to the word of Jehovah, and so went and took up dwelling by the torrent valley of Che&acute;rith that is east of the Jordan.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the ravens themselves were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and from the torrent valley he kept drinking.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But it came about at the end of some days that the torrent valley became dry, because there had occurred no downpour upon the earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The word of Jehovah now came to him, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Rise up, go to Zar&acute;e&middot;phath, which belongs to Si&acute;don, and you must dwell there. Look! I shall certainly command there a woman, a widow, to supply you food.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Accordingly he rose up and went to Zar&acute;e&middot;phath and came into the entrance of the city; and, look! a woman, a widow, was there gathering up pieces of wood. So he called to her and said: “Please, get me a sip of water in a vessel that I may drink.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">When she began to go and get it, he went on to call to her and say: “Please, get me a bit of bread in your hand.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At this she said: “As Jehovah your God is living, I have no round cake, but a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar; and here I am gathering up a few pieces of wood, and I must go in and make something for myself and my son, and we shall have to eat it and die.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then E&middot;li&acute;jah said to her: “Do not be afraid. Go in, do according to your word. Only from what is there make me a small round cake first, and you must bring it out to me, and for yourself and your son you can make something afterward.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘The large jar of flour itself will not get exhausted, and the small jar of oil itself will not fail until the day of Jehovah’s giving a downpour upon the surface of the ground.’”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So she went and did according to E&middot;li&acute;jah’s word; and she continued to eat, she together with him and her household, for days.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The large jar of flour itself did not get exhausted, and the small jar of oil itself did not fail, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken by means of E&middot;li&acute;jah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it came about after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and his sickness came to be so severe that there was no breath left in him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At this she said to E&middot;li&acute;jah: “What do I have to do with you, O man of the [true] God? You have come to me to bring my error to mind and to put my son to death.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But he said to her: “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the roof chamber, where he was dwelling, and laid him upon his own couch.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he began calling to Jehovah and saying: “O Jehovah my God, is it also upon the widow with whom I am residing as an alien that you must bring injury by putting her son to death?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he proceeded to stretch himself upon the child three times and call to Jehovah and say: “O Jehovah my God, please, cause the soul of this child to come back within him.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally Jehovah listened to E&middot;li&acute;jah’s voice, so that the soul of the child came back within him and he came to life.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">E&middot;li&acute;jah now took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother; and E&middot;li&acute;jah then said: “See, your son is alive.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Upon that the woman said to E&middot;li&acute;jah: “Now, indeed, I do know that you are a man of God and that Jehovah’s word in your mouth is true.”</span>

Perhaps we may find green grass, that we may preserve the horses and mules alive and may not have [any more] of the beasts cut off.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So they divided between themselves the land through which to pass. A&acute;hab himself went alone by one way, and O&middot;ba&middot;di&acute;ah himself went alone by another way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As O&middot;ba&middot;di&acute;ah continued on the way, why, there was E&middot;li&acute;jah to meet him. At once he recognized him and fell upon his face and said: “Is this you, my lord E&middot;li&acute;jah?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At this he said to him: “It is I. Go, say to your lord, ‘Here is E&middot;li&acute;jah.’”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But he said: “What sin have I committed that you should be putting your servant into the hand of A&acute;hab to put me to death?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">As Jehovah your God is living, there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you. After they had said, ‘He is not [here],’ he made the kingdom and the nation swear that they could not find you.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Here is E&middot;li&acute;jah.”’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And it is bound to occur that, when I myself go from you, then the spirit of Jehovah itself will carry you away to where I shall not know; and I shall have come to tell A&acute;hab, and he will not find you, and he will be bound to kill me, as your servant himself has feared Jehovah from his youth.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Has not my lord been told what I did when Jez&acute;e&middot;bel killed the prophets of Jehovah, how I kept some of the prophets of Jehovah hid, a hundred men by fifties in a cave, and kept supplying them bread and water?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Here is E&middot;li&acute;jah.”’ And he will be bound to kill me.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, E&middot;li&acute;jah said: “As Jehovah of armies before whom I do stand is living, today I shall show myself to him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly O&middot;ba&middot;di&acute;ah went off to meet A&acute;hab and told him; and so A&acute;hab went to meet E&middot;li&acute;jah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it came about that, as soon as A&acute;hab saw E&middot;li&acute;jah, A&acute;hab immediately said to him: “Is this you, the bringer of ostracism upon Israel?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">To this he said: “I have not brought ostracism upon Israel, but you and the house of your father have, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men have left the commandments of Jehovah, and you went following the Ba&acute;als.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And now send, collect together all Israel to me at Mount Car&acute;mel and also the four hundred and fifty prophets of Ba&acute;al and the four hundred prophets of the sacred pole, who are eating at the table of Jez&acute;e&middot;bel.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And A&acute;hab proceeded to send among all the sons of Israel and collect the prophets together at Mount Car&acute;mel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then E&middot;li&acute;jah approached all the people and said: “How long will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be limping upon two different opinions? If Jehovah is the [true] God, go following him; but if Ba&acute;al is, go following him.” And the people did not say a word in answer to him.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And E&middot;li&acute;jah went on to say to the people: “I myself have been left as a prophet of Jehovah, I alone, while the prophets of Ba&acute;al are four hundred and fifty men.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now let them give us two young bulls, and let them choose for themselves one young bull and cut it in pieces and put it upon the wood, but they should not put fire to it. And I myself shall dress the other young bull, and I must place it upon the wood, but I shall not put fire to it.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must call upon the name of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> god, and I, for my part, shall call upon the name of Jehovah; and it must occur that the [true] God that answers by fire is the [true] God.” To this all the people answered and said: “The thing is good.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">E&middot;li&acute;jah now said to the prophets of Ba&acute;al: “Choose for yourselves one young bull and dress it first, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are the majority; and call upon the name of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> god, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not put fire to it.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Accordingly they took the young bull that he gave them. Then they dressed it, and they kept calling upon the name of Ba&acute;al from morning till noon, saying: “O Ba&acute;al, answer us!” But there was no voice, and there was no one answering. And they kept limping around the altar that they had made.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And it came about at noon that E&middot;li&acute;jah began to mock them and say: “Call at the top of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> voice, for he is a god; for he must be concerned with a matter, and he has excrement and has to go to the privy. Or maybe he is asleep and ought to wake up!”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And they began calling at the top of their voice and cutting themselves according to their custom with daggers and with lances, until they caused blood to flow out upon them.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about that, as soon as noon was past and they continued behaving as prophets until the going up of the grain offering, there was no voice, and there was no one answering, and there was no paying of attention.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">At length E&middot;li&acute;jah said to all the people: “Approach me.” So all the people approached him. Then he proceeded to mend the altar of Jehovah that was torn down.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So E&middot;li&acute;jah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah’s word had come, saying: “Israel is what your name will become.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And he went on to build the stones into an altar in the name of Jehovah and to make a trench, of about the area sowed with two seah measures of seed, all around the altar.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">After that he put the pieces of wood in order and cut the young bull in pieces and placed it upon the pieces of wood. He now said: “F<span class="smallcaps">ILL</span> four large jars with water and pour it upon the burnt offering and upon the pieces of wood.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Then he said: “Do it again.” So they did it again. But he said: “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Thus the water went all around the altar, and the trench also he filled with water.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And it came about at the time that the grain offering goes up that E&middot;li&acute;jah the prophet began to approach and say: “O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that you are God in Israel and I am your servant and it is by your word that I have done all these things.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Answer me, O Jehovah, answer me, that this people may know that you, Jehovah, are the [true] God and you yourself have turned their heart back.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">At that the fire of Jehovah came falling and went eating up the burnt offering and the pieces of wood and the stones and the dust, and the water that was in the trench it licked up.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">When all the people saw it, they immediately fell upon their faces and said: “Jehovah is the [true] God! Jehovah is the [true] God!”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Then E&middot;li&acute;jah said to them: “Seize the prophets of Ba&acute;al! Do not let a single one of them escape!” At once they seized them, and E&middot;li&acute;jah then brought them down to the torrent valley of Ki&acute;shon and slaughtered them there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">E&middot;li&acute;jah now said to A&acute;hab: “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the turmoil of a downpour.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And A&acute;hab proceeded to go up to eat and drink. As for E&middot;li&acute;jah, he went up to the top of Car&acute;mel and began crouching to the earth and keeping his face put between his knees.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Then he said to his attendant: “Go up, please. Look in the direction of the sea.” So he went up and looked and then said: “There is nothing at all.” And he went on to say, “Go back,” for seven times.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And it came about at the seventh time that he got to say: “Look! There is a small cloud like a man’s palm ascending out of the sea.” He now said: “Go up, say to A&acute;hab, ‘Hitch up! And go down that the downpour may not detain you!’”</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And it came about in the meantime that the heavens themselves darkened up with clouds and wind and a great downpour began to occur. And A&acute;hab kept riding and made his way to Jez&acute;re&middot;el.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And the very hand of Jehovah proved to be upon E&middot;li&acute;jah, so that he girded up his hips and went running ahead of A&acute;hab all the way to Jez&acute;re&middot;el.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then A&acute;hab told Jez&acute;e&middot;bel all that E&middot;li&acute;jah had done and all about how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At that Jez&acute;e&middot;bel sent a messenger to E&middot;li&acute;jah, saying: “So may the gods do, and so may they add to it, if at this time tomorrow I shall not make your soul like the soul of each one of them!”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he became afraid. Consequently he rose up and began to go for his soul and came to Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba, which belongs to Judah. Then he left his attendant behind there.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he himself went into the wilderness a day’s journey, and at length came and sat down under a certain broom tree. And he began to ask that his soul might die and to say: “It is enough! Now, O Jehovah, take my soul away, for I am no better than my forefathers.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Finally he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree. But, look! now an angel was touching him. Then he said to him: “Rise up, eat.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">When he looked, why, there at his head was a round cake upon heated stones and a jug of water. And he began to eat and drink, after which he lay down again.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said: “Rise up, eat, for the journey is too much for you.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So he rose up and ate and drank, and he kept going in the power of that nourishment for forty days and forty nights as far as the mountain of the [true] God, Ho&acute;reb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">There he finally entered into a cave, that he might spend the night there; and, look! there was Jehovah’s word for him, and it went on to say to him: “What is your business here, E&middot;li&acute;jah?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">To this he said: “I have been absolutely jealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have left your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, so that I only am left; and they begin looking for my soul to take it away.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But it said: “Go out, and you must stand on the mountain before Jehovah.” And, look! Jehovah was passing by, and a great and strong wind was rending mountains and breaking crags before Jehovah. (Jehovah was not in the wind.) And after the wind there was a quaking. (Jehovah was not in the quaking.)</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And after the quaking there was a fire. (Jehovah was not in the fire.) And after the fire there was a calm, low voice.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it came about that as soon as E&middot;li&acute;jah heard it, he immediately wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave; and, look! there was a voice for him, and it proceeded to say to him: “What is your business here, E&middot;li&acute;jah?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">To this he said: “I have been absolutely jealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have left your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, so that I only am left; and they begin looking for my soul to take it away.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Jehovah now said to him: “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and you must come in and anoint Haz&acute;a&middot;el as king over Syria.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Je&acute;hu the grandson of Nim&acute;shi you should anoint as king over Israel; and E&middot;li&acute;sha the son of Sha&acute;phat from A&acute;bel-me&middot;ho&acute;lah you should anoint as prophet in place of you.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it must occur that the one escaping from Haz&acute;a&middot;el’s sword, Je&acute;hu will put to death; and the one escaping from Je&acute;hu’s sword, E&middot;li&acute;sha will put to death.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I have let seven thousand remain in Israel, all the knees that have not bent down to Ba&acute;al, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Accordingly he went from there and found E&middot;li&acute;sha the son of Sha&acute;phat while he was plowing with twelve spans before him, and he with the twelfth. So E&middot;li&acute;jah crossed over to him and threw his official garment upon him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">At that he left the bulls and went running after E&middot;li&acute;jah and said: “Let me, please, kiss my father and my mother. Then I will go following you.” At this he said to him: “Go, return; for what have I done to you?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So he returned from following him and then took a span of the bulls and sacrificed them, and with the implements of the bulls he boiled their flesh and then gave it to the people, and they proceeded to eat. After that he rose up and went following E&middot;li&acute;jah and began to minister to him.</span>

<p class="title">1 Kings 20:1-43</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="22">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="43">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">As for Ben-ha&acute;dad the king of Syria, he collected all his military forces together and also thirty-two kings with him and horses and chariots, and he proceeded to go up and lay siege to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and fight against it.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then he sent messengers to A&acute;hab the king of Israel at the city. And he went on to say to him: “This is what Ben-ha&acute;dad has said,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">‘Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your sons, the best looking, are mine.’”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">To this the king of Israel answered and said: “According to your word, my lord the king, yours I am with all that belongs to me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later the messengers came back and said: “This is what Ben-ha&acute;dad has said, ‘I sent to you, saying: “Your silver and your gold and your wives and your sons you will give me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But about this time tomorrow I shall send my servants to you, and they must carefully search your house and the houses of your servants; and it must occur that everything desirable to your eyes they will put in their hand, and they must take it away.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">At that the king of Israel called all the older men of the land and said: “Take note, please, and see that it is calamity that this one is seeking; for he sent to me for my wives and my sons and my silver and my gold, and I did not hold them back from him.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then all the older men and all the people said to him: “Do not obey, and you should not consent.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So he said to the messengers of Ben-ha&acute;dad: “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you sent to your servant at first I shall do; but this thing I am not able to do.’” With that the messengers went off and brought word back to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Ben-ha&acute;dad now sent to him and said: “So may the gods do to me, and so may they add to it, if the dust of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a will be sufficient for handfuls for all the people that follow me!”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In turn the king of Israel answered and said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> men, speak [to him], ‘Do not let one girding on boast about himself like one unfastening.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And it came about that as soon as he heard this word, while he himself and the kings were drinking in the booths, he immediately said to his servants: “Get set!” And they began to get set against the city.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And, look! a certain prophet approached A&acute;hab the king of Israel and then said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Have you seen all this great crowd? Here I am giving it into your hand today, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.’”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then A&acute;hab said: “By whom?” to which he said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘By the young men of the princes of the jurisdictional districts.’” Finally he said: “Who will open the battle engagement?” to which he said: “You!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to take the count of the young men of the princes of the jurisdictional districts, and they came to be two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he took the count of all the people, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And they began to go out at noon while Ben-ha&acute;dad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he together with the kings, the thirty-two kings that were helping him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When the young men of the princes of the jurisdictional districts came out first, Ben-ha&acute;dad at once sent out; and they came telling him, saying: “There are men that have come out from Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that he said: “Whether it is for peace that they have come out, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should seize them alive; or whether it is for battle that they have come out, alive is how <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should seize them.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And these were the ones that came out from the city, the young men of the princes of the jurisdictional districts and the military forces that were behind them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And they began to strike down each one his man; and the Syrians took to flight, and Israel went in pursuit of them, but Ben-ha&acute;dad the king of Syria got to escape upon a horse together with the horsemen.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But the king of Israel went out and kept striking down the horses and the chariots, and he struck down the Syrians with a great slaughter.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him: “Go, strengthen yourself and take note and see what you are going to do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria is coming up against you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">As for the servants of the king of Syria, they said to him: “Their God is a God of mountains. That is why they proved stronger than we were. So, on the other hand, let us fight against them on the level land [and see] whether we shall not prove stronger than they are.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And do this thing: Remove the kings each one from his place and put in governors instead of them.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">As for you, you should number a military force for yourself equal to the military force that fell from your side, with horse for horse and chariot for chariot; and let us fight against them on the level land [and see] whether we shall not prove stronger than they are.” Accordingly he listened to their voice and did just that way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And it came about at the return of the year that Ben-ha&acute;dad proceeded to muster the Syrians and to go up to A&acute;phek for battle against Israel.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">As for the sons of Israel, they were mustered and supplied and began to go out to meet them; and the sons of Israel went into camp in front of them like two tiny flocks of goats, while the Syrians, for their part, filled the earth.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then the man of the [true] God approached and said to the king of Israel, yes, he went on to say: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that the Syrians have said: “Jehovah is a God of mountains, and he is not a God of low plains,” I shall have to give all this great crowd into your hand, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men will certainly know that I am Jehovah.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And they continued encamped for seven days, these in front of those. And it came about on the seventh day that the engagement in battle began; and the sons of Israel went striking down the Syrians, a hundred thousand men on foot in one day.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And those that were left went fleeing to A&acute;phek, to the city; and the wall came falling down upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left. As for Ben-ha&acute;dad, he fled and finally came into the city into the innermost chamber.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So his servants said to him: “Here, now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of loving-kindness. Please, let us carry sackcloth upon our loins and ropes upon our heads, and let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will preserve your soul alive.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Accordingly they girded sackcloth about their loins, with ropes upon their heads, and came in to the king of Israel and said: “Your servant Ben-ha&acute;dad has said, ‘Please, let my soul live.’” To this he said: “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So the men themselves took it as an omen and quickly took it as a decision of his own accord, and they went on to say: “Ben-ha&acute;dad is your brother.” At that he said: “Come, fetch him.” Then Ben-ha&acute;dad went out to him; and he at once had him get up into the chariot.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">[Ben-ha&acute;dad] now said to him: “The cities that my father took from your father I shall return; and streets you will assign to yourself in Damascus the same as my father assigned in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs34-2">“And as for me, in a covenant I shall send you away.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs34-3">With that he concluded a covenant with him and sent him away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his friend by the word of Jehovah: “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Therefore he said to him: “For the reason that you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, here you are going away from me, and a lion will certainly strike you down.” After that he went away from beside him, and the lion got to find him and strike him down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And he went on to find another man and to say: “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him, striking and wounding.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then the prophet went and stood still for the king by the road, and he kept himself disguised with a bandage over his eyes.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And it came about that as the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and proceeded to say: “Your servant himself went out into the thick of the battle; and, look! a man was leaving the line, and he came bringing a man to me and then said, ‘Guard this man. If he should in any way be missing, your soul will also have to take the place of his soul, or else a talent of silver you will weigh out.’</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And it came about that as your servant was active here and there, why, he himself was gone.” At this the king of Israel said to him: “Thus your own judgment is. You yourself have decided.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Upon that he hurriedly removed the bandage from over his eyes, and the king of Israel got to recognize him, that he was from the prophets.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">He now said to him: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that you have let go out of your hand the man devoted to me for destruction, your soul must take the place of his soul, and your people the place of his people.’”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">At that the king of Israel went on his way toward his house, sullen and dejected, and came to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="29">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about after these things that there was a vineyard that happened to belong to Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite, which was in Jez&acute;re&middot;el, beside the palace of A&acute;hab the king of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So A&acute;hab spoke to Na&acute;both, saying: “Do give me your vineyard, that it may serve as a garden of vegetables to me, for it is close by my house; and let me give you in place of it a vineyard better than it. [Or] if it is good in your eyes, I will give you money as the price of this.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But Na&acute;both said to A&acute;hab: “It is unthinkable on my part, from Jehovah’s standpoint, for me to give the hereditary possession of my forefathers to you.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Consequently A&acute;hab came into his house, sullen and dejected over the word that Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite had spoken to him, when he said: “I shall not give you the hereditary possession of my forefathers.” Then he lay down upon his couch and kept his face turned, and he did not eat bread.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Finally Jez&acute;e&middot;bel his wife came in to him and spoke to him: “Why is it that your spirit is sad and you are not eating bread?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that he spoke to her: “Because I proceeded to speak to Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite and say to him, ‘Do give me your vineyard for money. Or, if you prefer, let me give you another vineyard in place of it.’ But he said, ‘I shall not give you my vineyard.’”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Jez&acute;e&middot;bel his wife said to him: “Is it you that now exercise the kingship over Israel? Rise up, eat bread and let your heart be merry. I myself shall give you the vineyard of Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Accordingly she wrote letters in A&acute;hab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the older men and the nobles that were in his city dwelling with Na&acute;both.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But she wrote in the letters, saying: “Proclaim a fast, and <span class="smallcaps">HAVE</span> Na&acute;both sit at the head of the people.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And <span class="smallcaps">MAKE</span> two men, good-for-nothing fellows, sit in front of him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king!’ And <span class="smallcaps">BRING</span> him out and stone him that he may die.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So the men of his city, the older men and the nobles that were dwelling in his city, did just as Jez&acute;e&middot;bel had sent to them, just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">They proclaimed a fast and had Na&acute;both sit at the head of the people.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then two of the men, good-for-nothing fellows, came in and sat down in front of him; and the good-for-nothing men began to bear witness against him, that is, Na&acute;both, in front of the people, saying: “Na&acute;both has cursed God and the king!” After that they brought him out to the outskirts of the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">They now sent to Jez&acute;e&middot;bel, saying: “Na&acute;both has been stoned so that he is dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it came about that, as soon as Jez&acute;e&middot;bel heard that Na&acute;both had been stoned so that he died, Jez&acute;e&middot;bel immediately said to A&acute;hab: “Rise up, take possession of the vineyard of Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite, which he refused to give you for money; for Na&acute;both is no longer alive, but dead.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it came about that, as soon as A&acute;hab heard that Na&acute;both was dead, A&acute;hab at once rose up to go down to the vineyard of Na&acute;both the Jez&acute;re&middot;el&middot;ite, to take possession of it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Jehovah’s word came to E&middot;li&acute;jah the Tish&acute;bite, saying:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Rise up, go down to meet A&acute;hab the king of Israel, who is in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a. There he is in the vineyard of Na&acute;both, where he has gone down to take possession of it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And you must speak to him, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Have you murdered and also taken possession?”’ And you must speak to him, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Na&acute;both, the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And A&acute;hab proceeded to say to E&middot;li&acute;jah: “Have you found me, O enemy of mine?” to which he said: “I have found you. ‘For the reason that you have sold yourself to do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">here I am bringing calamity upon you; and I shall certainly make a clean sweep after you and cut off from A&acute;hab anyone urinating against a wall and the helpless and worthless one in Israel.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And I shall certainly constitute your house like the house of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat and like the house of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the son of A&middot;hi&acute;jah, for the offense with which you have offended and then caused Israel to sin.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And also as regards Jez&acute;e&middot;bel Jehovah has spoken, saying, ‘The very dogs will eat up Jez&acute;e&middot;bel in the plot of land of Jez&acute;re&middot;el.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Anyone of A&acute;hab’s that is dying in the city the dogs will eat up; and anyone dying in the field the fowls of the heavens will eat up.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Without exception no one has proved to be like A&acute;hab, who sold himself to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, whom Jez&acute;e&middot;bel his wife egged on.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he went acting very detestably by going after the dungy idols, the same as all that the Am&acute;or&middot;ites had done, whom Jehovah drove out from before the sons of Israel.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And it came about that as soon as A&acute;hab heard these words, he proceeded to rip his garments apart and to put sackcloth upon his flesh; and he went on a fast and kept lying down in sackcloth and walking despondently.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Jehovah’s word came to E&middot;li&acute;jah the Tish&acute;bite, saying:</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Have you seen how A&acute;hab has humbled himself on my account? For the reason that he has humbled himself because of me, I shall not bring the calamity in his own days. In the days of his son I shall bring the calamity upon his house.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And for three years they continued dwelling without war between Syria and Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it came about in the third year that Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah proceeded to go down to the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then the king of Israel said to his servants: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> really know that Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad belongs to us? Yet we are hesitating to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he went on to say to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “Will you go with me to the fight at Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad?” At this Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat said to the king of Israel: “I am the same as you. My people are the same as your people. My horses are the same as your horses.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">However, Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat went on to say to the king of Israel: “Inquire, please, first of all for the word of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So the king of Israel collected the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them: “Shall I go against Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad in war, or shall I refrain?” And they began to say: “Go up, and Jehovah will give it into the king’s hand.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat said: “Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah still? Then let us inquire through him.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that the king of Israel said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “There is still one man through whom to inquire of Jehovah; but I myself certainly hate him, for he does not prophesy good things concerning me but bad—Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the son of Im&acute;lah.” However, Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat said: “Do not let the king say a thing like that.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Accordingly the king of Israel called a certain court official and said: “Do bring Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the son of Im&acute;lah quickly.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now the king of Israel and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah were sitting each one on his throne, clothed in garments, in the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Che&middot;na&acute;a&middot;nah made for himself horns of iron and said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘With these you will push the Syrians until you exterminate them.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And all the other prophets were prophesying the same as that, saying: “Go up to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad and prove successful; and Jehovah will certainly give it into the king’s hand.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the messenger that had gone to call Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah spoke to him, saying: “Look, now! The words of the prophets are unanimously of good to the king. Let your word, please, become like the word of one of them, and you must speak good.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “As Jehovah is living, what Jehovah will say to me, that is what I shall speak.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then he came in to the king, and the king proceeded to say to him: “Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah, shall we go to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad in war, or shall we refrain?” At once he said to him: “Go up and prove successful; and Jehovah will certainly give it into the king’s hand.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that the king said to him: “For how many times am I putting you under oath that you should not speak to me anything but truth in the name of Jehovah?”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So he said: “I certainly see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah went on to say: ‘These have no masters. Let them go back each one to his house in peace.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then the king of Israel said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “Did I not say to you, ‘He will prophesy concerning me, not good things, but bad’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he went on to say: “Therefore hear the word of Jehovah: I certainly see Jehovah sitting upon his throne and all the army of the heavens standing by him, to his right and to his left.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jehovah proceeded to say, ‘Who will fool A&acute;hab, that he may go up and fall at Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad?’ And this one began to say something like this, while that one was saying something like that.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Finally a spirit came out and stood before Jehovah and said, ‘I myself shall fool him.’ At that Jehovah said to him, ‘By what means?’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">To this he said, ‘I shall go forth, and I shall certainly become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ So he said, ‘You will fool him, and, what is more, you will come off the winner. Go out and do that way.’</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And now here Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit into the mouth of all these prophets of yours; but Jehovah himself has spoken calamity concerning you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Che&middot;na&acute;a&middot;nah now approached and struck Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah upon the cheek and said: “In just which [way] did the spirit of Jehovah pass along from me to speak with you?”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">At that Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “Look! You are seeing [which way] on that day when you will enter the innermost chamber to hide yourself.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then the king of Israel said: “Take Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah and turn him back to A&acute;mon the chief of the city and to Jo&acute;ash the king’s son.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And you must say, ‘This is what the king has said: “P<span class="smallcaps">UT</span> this fellow in the house of detention and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and a reduced allowance of water until I come in peace.”’”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Upon that Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “If you return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.” And he added: “Hear, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> peoples.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the king of Israel and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah proceeded to go up to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">The king of Israel now said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “There will be a disguising and entering into the battle [for me], but you, for your part, put on your garments.” Accordingly, the king of Israel disguised himself and entered into the battle.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">As for the king of Syria, he had commanded the thirty-two chiefs of the chariots that were his, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must fight, neither with the small nor the great, but with the king of Israel alone.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And it came about that, as soon as the chiefs of the chariots saw Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, they, for their part, said to themselves: “Surely it is the king of Israel.” So they turned aside against him to fight; and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat began to cry for aid.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And it came about that, as soon as the chiefs of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they immediately came back from following him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And there was a man that bent the bow in his innocence, but he got to strike the king of Israel between the appendages and the coat of mail, so that he said to his charioteer: “Turn your hand around, and take me out from the camp, because I have been badly wounded.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And the battle kept rising in intensity on that day, and the king himself had to be kept in a standing position in the chariot facing the Syrians, and gradually he died in the evening; and the blood of the wound kept pouring out upon the interior of the war chariot.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And the ringing cry began to pass through the camp about the setting of the sun, saying: “Everyone to his city, and everyone to his land!”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Thus the king died. When he was brought to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, then they buried the king in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And they began to wash off the war chariot by the pool of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, and the dogs went licking up his blood (and the prostitutes themselves bathed there), according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">As for the rest of the affairs of A&acute;hab and all that he did and the house of ivory that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel?</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Finally A&acute;hab lay down with his forefathers; and A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">As for Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the son of A&acute;sa, he had become king over Judah in the fourth year of A&acute;hab the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and for twenty-five years he reigned in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was A&middot;zu&acute;bah the daughter of Shil&acute;hi.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And he kept walking in all the way of A&acute;sa his father. He did not turn aside from it, by doing what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. Only the high places themselves did not disappear. The people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat kept peaceful relations with the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">As for the rest of the affairs of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat and the mightiness with which he acted and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Judah?</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And the rest of the male temple prostitutes that had been left over in the days of A&acute;sa his father he cleared out from the land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">As regards a king, there was none in E&acute;dom; a deputy was king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, for his part, made Tar&acute;shish ships to go to O&acute;phir for gold; but they did not go, because the ships were wrecked at E&acute;zi&middot;on-ge&acute;ber.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">It was then that A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah the son of A&acute;hab said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat did not consent.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Finally Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat lay down with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather; and Je&middot;ho&acute;ram his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">As for A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah the son of A&acute;hab, he became king over Israel in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a in the seventeenth year of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah, and he continued to reign over Israel for two years.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes and went walking in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat, who had caused Israel to sin.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">And he continued serving Ba&acute;al and bowing down to him and kept offending Jehovah the God of Israel according to all that his father had done.</span>
