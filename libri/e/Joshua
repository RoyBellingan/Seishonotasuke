       <span id="vs1">And it came about after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah that Jehovah proceeded to say to Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Moses my servant is dead; and now get up, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Every place upon which the sole of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> foot will tread, to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people I shall certainly give it, just as I promised to Moses.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs5">Nobody will take a firm stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I proved to be with Moses I shall prove to be with you. I shall neither desert you nor leave you entirely.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their forefathers to give to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Only be courageous and very strong to take care to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it to the right or to the left, in order that you may act wisely everywhere you go.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">This book of the law should not depart from your mouth, and you must in an undertone read in it day and night, in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and strong. Do not suffer shock or be terrified, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Joshua proceeded to command the officers of the people, saying:</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Get provisions ready for yourselves, because three days from now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are crossing this Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to take possession of it.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And to the Reu&acute;ben&middot;ites and the Gad&acute;ites and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh Joshua said:</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Let there be a remembering of the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rest and has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> this land.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> wives, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> livestock will dwell in the land that Moses has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on this side of the Jordan; but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men will pass over in battle formation before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, all the valiant mighty men, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must help them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">First when Jehovah gives rest to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers the same as to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is giving them, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must also return to the land of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> holding and take possession of it, the one that Moses the servant of Jehovah has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on the side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly they answered Joshua, saying: “All that you have commanded us we shall do, and wherever you may send us we shall go.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As we listened to Moses in everything, so we shall listen to you. Only may Jehovah your God prove to be with you just as he proved to be with Moses.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Any man that behaves rebelliously against your order and does not listen to your words in all that you may command him will be put to death. Only be courageous and strong.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men out secretly from Shit&acute;tim as spies, saying: “Go, take a look at the land and Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.” So they went and came to the house of a prostitute woman whose name was Ra&acute;hab, and they took up lodging there.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">In time it was said to the king of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho: “Look! Men from the sons of Israel have come in here tonight to search out the land.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At that the king of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho sent to Ra&acute;hab, saying: “Bring out the men that came to you, that have come into your house, for it is to search out all the land that they have come.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Meantime the woman took the two men and concealed them. And she proceeded to say: “Yes, the men did come to me, and I did not know from where they were.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it came about at the closing of the gate by dark that the men went out. I just do not know where the men have gone. Chase after them quickly, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will overtake them.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">(She, though, had taken them up to the roof, and she kept them out of sight among stalks of flax laid in rows for her upon the roof.)</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the men chased after them in the direction of the Jordan at the fords, and they shut the gate immediately after those chasing after them had gone out.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">As for these, before they could lie down, she herself came up to them on the roof.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And she went on to say to the men: “I do know that Jehovah will certainly give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the land, and that the fright of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have become disheartened because of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea from before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came out of Egypt, and what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did to the two kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were on the other side of the Jordan, namely, Si&acute;hon and Og, whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> devoted to destruction.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">When we got to hear it, then our hearts began to melt, and no spirit has arisen yet in anybody because of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And now, please, swear to me by Jehovah that, because I have exercised loving-kindness toward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also will certainly exercise loving-kindness toward the household of my father, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must give me a trustworthy sign.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must preserve alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all who belong to them, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must deliver our souls from death.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At that the men said to her: “Our souls are to die instead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not tell about this matter of ours, it must also occur that when Jehovah gives us the land, we also shall certainly exercise loving-kindness and trustworthiness toward you.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that she had them descend by a rope through the window, for her house was on a side of the wall, and it was on the wall that she was dwelling.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And she proceeded to say to them: “Go to the mountainous region, that those in pursuit may not come in contact with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep hid there three days, until those in pursuit have come back, and afterward <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may go in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own direction.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In turn the men said to her: “We are free from guilt respecting this oath of yours that you have made us swear.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Look! We are coming into the land. This cord of scarlet thread you should tie in the window by which you have had us descend, and your father and your mother and your brothers and all the household of your father you should gather to yourself into the house.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And it must occur that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the open, his blood will be upon his own head, and we shall be free from guilt; and everyone who continues with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads if a hand should come upon him.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And if you should report this matter of ours, we shall also have become free from guilt respecting this oath of yours that you have made us swear.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">To this she said: “According to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> words so let it be.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs21-2">With that she sent them off, and they went their way. After that she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So they went and came to the mountainous region and kept dwelling there three days, until the pursuers had come back. Now the pursuers were looking for them on every road, and they did not find them.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the two men proceeded to descend again from the mountainous region and to cross over and come to Joshua the son of Nun, and they began to relate to him all the things that had happened to them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they went on to say to Joshua: “Jehovah has given all the land into our hand. Consequently all the inhabitants of the land have also grown disheartened because of us.”</span>

       <span id="vs3">and to command the people, saying: “As soon as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and the priests, the Levites, carrying it, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will pull away from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> place, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must follow it,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">—only let there prove to be a distance between <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and it of about two thousand cubits by measure; do not get near to it—in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may know the way by which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should go, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not passed over on that way before.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Joshua now said to the people: “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Joshua said to the priests: “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass before the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Jehovah proceeded to say to Joshua: “This day I shall start to make you great in the eyes of all Israel, that they may know that just as I proved to be with Moses I shall prove to be with you.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And you—you should command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘As soon as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have come as far as the edge of the waters of the Jordan, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should stand still in the Jordan.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Joshua went on to say to the sons of Israel: “Approach here and listen to the words of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">After that Joshua said: “By this <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will know that a living God is in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst, and that he will without fail drive away from before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Hi&acute;vites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Gir&acute;ga&middot;shites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is passing before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into the Jordan.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And now take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it must occur that at the instant that the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, the waters descending from above, and they will stand still as one dam.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And it came about that when the people pulled away from their tents just before passing over the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and at the instant that the carriers of the Ark came as far as the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the Ark were dipped in the edge of the waters (now the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">then the waters descending from above began to stand still. They rose up as one dam very far away at Adam, the city at the side of Zar&acute;e&middot;than, while those descending toward the sea of the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah, the Salt Sea, were exhausted. They were cut off, and the people passed over in front of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Meanwhile the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah’s covenant kept standing immovable on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan as all Israel were passing over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed passing over the Jordan.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about that as soon as the whole nation had completed passing over the Jordan, Jehovah proceeded to say to Joshua:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and command them, saying, ‘Take up for yourselves from the very middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood motionless, twelve stones, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must carry them over with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and deposit them in the lodging place in which you will lodge tonight.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So Joshua called twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and Joshua went on to say to them: “Pass ahead of the ark of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God to the middle of the Jordan, and lift up for yourselves each one a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">in order that this may serve as a sign in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst. In case <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons should ask in time to come, saying, ‘Why do you have these stones?’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7"><span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must also say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off from before the ark of Jehovah’s covenant. When it passed through the Jordan the waters of the Jordan were cut off, and these stones must serve as a memorial to the sons of Israel to time indefinite.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Accordingly the sons of Israel did so, just as Joshua had commanded, and they took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as Jehovah had stated to Joshua, to correspond with the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they went taking them over with them to the lodging place and depositing them there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">There were also twelve stones that Joshua set up in the middle of the Jordan on the standing place of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, and they continue there until this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the priests carrying the Ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until the whole matter had been completed that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. All the while the people hurried up and passed over.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about that as soon as all the people had completed passing over, then the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, before the people.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh proceeded to pass over in battle formation in the sight of the sons of Israel, just as Moses had stated to them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">About forty thousand equipped for the army passed over before Jehovah for the war onto the desert plains of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">On that day Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they began to fear him just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then Jehovah said to Joshua:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony that they go up out of the Jordan.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So Joshua commanded the priests, saying: “Go up out of the Jordan.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And it came about that when the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up out of the middle of the Jordan and the soles of the feet of the priests were drawn out onto the dry ground, then the waters of the Jordan began returning to their place and went overflowing all its banks as formerly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and took up camping at Gil&acute;gal on the eastern border of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for the twelve stones that they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set these up at Gil&acute;gal.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he went on to say to the sons of Israel: “When <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22"><span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must then let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons know, saying, ‘On the dry land it was that Israel passed over this Jordan,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">when Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before them until they had passed over, just as Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up from before us until we had passed over;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Jehovah’s hand, that it is strong; in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may indeed fear Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God always.’”</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="15">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about that as soon as all the kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, who were on the side of the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel until they had passed over, then their hearts began to melt, and there proved to be no spiritedness in them anymore because of the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At that particular time Jehovah said to Joshua: “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel again, the second time.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Accordingly Joshua made flint knives for himself and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gib&acute;e&middot;ath-ha&middot;ar&acute;a&middot;loth.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And this was the reason why Joshua did the circumcising: all the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the road when they were coming out of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For all the people who came out proved to be circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the road when they were coming out of Egypt they had not circumcised.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For the sons of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation of the men of war who came out of Egypt that did not listen to the voice of Jehovah had come to its finish, to whom Jehovah swore that he would never let them see the land that Jehovah had sworn to their forefathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And their sons he raised up instead of them. These Joshua circumcised, because they proved to be uncircumcised, for they had not circumcised them on the road.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about that when they had completed circumcising all the nation, they kept sitting in their place in the camp until they revived.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.” So the name of that place came to be called Gil&acute;gal until this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the sons of Israel continued to camp in Gil&acute;gal, and they proceeded to carry out the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the desert plains of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they began to eat some of the yield of the land the day after the passover, unfermented cakes and roasted grains, on this same day.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the manna ceased on the following day when they had eaten some of the yield of the land, and manna did not occur anymore for the sons of Israel, and they began to eat some of the produce of the land of Ca&acute;naan in that year.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it came about when Joshua happened to be by Jer&acute;i&middot;cho that he proceeded to raise his eyes and look, and there there was a man standing in front of him with his drawn sword in his hand. So Joshua walked up to him and said to him: “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">To this he said: “No, but I—as prince of the army of Jehovah I have now come.” With that Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself and said to him: “What is my lord saying to his servant?”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In turn the prince of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua: “Draw your sandals from off your feet, because the place on which you are standing is holy.” At once Joshua did so.</span>

<p class="title">Joshua 6:1-27</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="27">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Jer&acute;i&middot;cho was tightly shut up because of the sons of Israel, no one going out and no one entering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Jehovah went on to say to Joshua: “See, I have given Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and its king, the valiant mighty men, into your hand.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men of war must march round the city, going round the city once. That is the way you should do for six days.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And seven priests should carry seven rams’ horns, before the Ark, and on the seventh day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should march round the city seven times and the priests should blow the horns.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it must occur that when they sound with the horn of the ram, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hear the sound of the horn, all the people should shout a great war cry; and the wall of the city must fall down flat, and the people must go up, each one straight before him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them: “Take up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests should carry seven rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he went on to say to the people: “Pass on and march round the city, and the war-equipped force should pass on ahead of the ark of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So it came about just as Joshua said to the people; and seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns before Jehovah passed on and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah was following them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the war-equipped force was going ahead of the priests blowing the horns, while the rear guard was following the Ark with a continual blowing on the horns.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must neither shout nor let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> voices be heard, and no word should come out of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mouths until the day when I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Shout!’ Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must shout.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he had the ark of Jehovah go marching round the city, going round once, after which they went to the camp and stayed overnight in the camp.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests went carrying the ark of Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah were walking, continually blowing the horns, and the war-equipped force was walking ahead of them, while the rear guard was following the ark of Jehovah with a continual blowing on the horns.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they went marching round the city on the second day once, after which they returned to the camp. That was the way they did for six days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it came about on the seventh day that they proceeded to get up early, as soon as the dawn ascended, and they went marching round the city in this manner seven times. Just on that day they marched round the city seven times.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it came about on the seventh time that the priests blew the horns, and Joshua proceeded to say to the people: “Shout; for Jehovah has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the city.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the city must become a thing devoted to destruction; it with everything that is in it belongs to Jehovah. Only Ra&acute;hab the prostitute may keep on living, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent out.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, only keep away from the thing devoted to destruction, for fear <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may get a desire and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do take some of the thing devoted to destruction and do constitute the camp of Israel a thing devoted to destruction and bring ostracism upon it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But all the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron are something holy to Jehovah. Into the treasure of Jehovah it should go.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then the people shouted, when they proceeded to blow the horns. And it came about that as soon as the people heard the sound of the horn and the people began to shout a great war cry, then the wall began to fall down flat. After that the people went up into the city, each one straight before him, and captured the city.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they went devoting all that was in the city, from man to woman, from young man to old man and to bull and sheep and ass, to destruction by the edge of the sword.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And to the two men who had done the spying on the land, Joshua said: “Go into the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out of there the woman and all who belong to her, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have sworn to her.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Ra&acute;hab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all who belonged to her, yes, all her family relationship they brought out; and they proceeded to set them down outside the camp of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they burned the city with fire and everything that was in it. Only the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron they gave to the treasure of Jehovah’s house.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Ra&acute;hab the prostitute and the household of her father and all who belonged to her, Joshua preserved alive; and she dwells in the midst of Israel down to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent out to spy on Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Joshua had an oath pronounced at that particular time, saying: “Cursed may the man be before Jehovah who gets up and does build this city, even Jer&acute;i&middot;cho. At the forfeit of his firstborn let him lay the foundation of it, and at the forfeit of his youngest let him put up its doors.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">So Jehovah proved to be with Joshua, and his fame came to be in all the earth.</span>

<p class="title">Joshua 7:1-26</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="24">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="26">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the sons of Israel went committing an act of unfaithfulness respecting the thing devoted to destruction in that A&acute;chan the son of Car&acute;mi, the son of Zab&acute;di, the son of Ze&acute;rah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the thing devoted to destruction. At this Jehovah’s anger grew hot against the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Joshua sent men out from Jer&acute;i&middot;cho to A&acute;i, which is close by Beth-a&acute;ven, to the east of Beth&acute;el, and said to them: “Go up and spy on the land.” Accordingly the men went up and spied on A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">After that they returned to Joshua and said to him: “Let not all the people go up. Let about two thousand men or about three thousand men go up and strike A&acute;i. Do not weary all the people with going there, for they are few.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So about three thousand men of the people went up there, but they took to flight before the men of A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the men of A&acute;i got to strike down about thirty-six men of them, and they went pursuing them from before the gate as far as Sheb&acute;a&middot;rim and continued striking them down on the descent. Consequently the heart of the people began to melt and became as water.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At this Joshua ripped his mantles and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the older men of Israel, and they kept putting dust upon their heads.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Joshua went on to say: “Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, why did you bring this people all the way across the Jordan, just to give us into the hand of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites for them to destroy us? And if only we had taken it upon ourselves and continued dwelling on the other side of the Jordan!</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Excuse me, O Jehovah, but what can I say after Israel has turned his back before his enemies?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will certainly surround us and cut our name off from the earth; and what will you do for your great name?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In turn Jehovah said to Joshua: “Get up, you! Why is it that you are falling upon your face?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Israel has sinned, and they have also overstepped my covenant that I laid as a command upon them; and they have also taken some of the thing devoted to destruction and have also stolen and also kept it secret and have also put it among their own articles.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the sons of Israel will not be able to rise up against their enemies. The back is what they will turn before their enemies, because they have become a thing devoted to destruction. I shall not prove to be with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> again unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> annihilate the thing devoted to destruction out of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Get up! Sanctify the people, and you must say, ‘Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said: “A thing devoted to destruction is in your midst, O Israel. You will not be able to rise up against your enemies until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have removed the thing devoted to destruction from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must present yourselves in the morning, tribe by tribe, and it must occur that the tribe that Jehovah will pick will come near, family by family, and the family that Jehovah will pick will come near, household by household, and the household that Jehovah will pick will come near, able-bodied man by able-bodied man.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it must occur that the one picked with the thing devoted to destruction will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has overstepped the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed a disgraceful folly in Israel.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Joshua rose early in the morning and had Israel come near, tribe by tribe of it, and the tribe of Judah got to be picked.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Next he had the families of Judah come near and picked the family of the Ze&acute;rah&middot;ites, after which he had the family of the Ze&acute;rah&middot;ites come near, able-bodied man by able-bodied man, and Zab&acute;di got to be picked.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Finally he had his household come near, able-bodied man by able-bodied man, and A&acute;chan the son of Car&acute;mi, the son of Zab&acute;di, the son of Ze&acute;rah, of the tribe of Judah, got to be picked.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Joshua said to A&acute;chan: “My son, render, please, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him, and tell me, please, What have you done? Do not hide it from me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">At this A&acute;chan answered Joshua and said: “For a fact I—I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this way and that way I have done.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">When I got to see among the spoil an official garment from Shi&acute;nar, a good-looking one, and two hundred shekels of silver and one gold bar, fifty shekels being its weight, then I wanted them, and I took them; and, look! they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent with the money underneath it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At once Joshua sent messengers, and they went running to the tent, and, look! it was hidden in his tent with the money underneath it.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So they took them from the midst of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the sons of Israel and poured them out before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Joshua, and all Israel with him, now took A&acute;chan the son of Ze&acute;rah and the silver and the official garment and the bar of gold and his sons and his daughters and his bull and his ass and his flock and his tent and everything that was his and they brought them up to the low plain of A&acute;chor.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then Joshua said: “Why have you brought ostracism upon us? Jehovah will bring ostracism upon you on this day.” With that all Israel went pelting him with stones, after which they burned them with fire. Thus they stoned them with stones.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they proceeded to raise up over him a big pile of stones, down to this day. At this Jehovah turned away from his hot anger. That is why the name of that place has been called Low Plain of A&acute;chor, down to this day.</span>

<p class="title">Joshua 8:1-35</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="35">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid or be terrified. Take with you all the people of war and get up, go up to A&acute;i. See, I have given into your hand the king of A&acute;i and his people and his city and his land.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And you must do to A&acute;i and to its king just as you did to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and its king. Only <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people may plunder its spoil and its domestic animals for yourselves. Set an ambush of yours against the city at its rear.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Accordingly Joshua and all the people of war rose to go up to A&acute;i, and Joshua proceeded to choose thirty thousand men, valiant mighty ones, and to send them off by night.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he went on to command them, saying: “See, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are lying in ambush against the city to the rear of the city. Do not go very far away from the city, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> hold yourselves in readiness.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">As for me and all the people who are with me, we shall go close to the city. And it must occur that, in case they should come out to meet us just as at the first, we must then flee before them.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And they must come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us just as at the first.’ And we must flee before them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>—<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will rise up from the ambush, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must take possession of the city; and Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God will certainly give it into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it must occur that as soon as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have seized the city, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should set the city on fire. According to Jehovah’s word <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should do. See, I have commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that Joshua sent them out and they marched to the place of ambush and took up quarters between Beth&acute;el and A&acute;i to the west of A&acute;i, while Joshua kept lodging on that night in the midst of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and reviewed the people and went up, he and the older men of Israel, before the people to A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all the people of war who were with him went up, that they might approach and get in front of the city, and they proceeded to camp to the north of A&acute;i, with the valley between them and A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">In the meantime he took about five thousand men and set them as an ambush between Beth&acute;el and A&acute;i, to the west of the city.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So the people set the main camp that was to the north of the city and the extreme rear of it that was to the west of the city, and Joshua proceeded to go during that night into the middle of the low plain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And it came about that, as soon as the king of A&acute;i saw it, then the men of the city got in a hurry and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people, at the appointed time, before the desert plain. As for him, he did not know that there was an ambush against him to the rear of the city.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When Joshua and all Israel suffered a blow before them, then they took to flight by the way of the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that all the people who were in the city were called out to chase after them, and they went chasing after Joshua and got to be drawn away from the city.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And there was not a man remaining in A&acute;i and Beth&acute;el that did not go out after Israel, so that they left the city wide open and went chasing after Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Jehovah now said to Joshua: “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward A&acute;i, for into your hand I shall give it.” Accordingly Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the ambush rose up quickly from its place, and they began to run at the instant that he stretched out his hand, and they proceeded to enter the city and capture it. Then they hurried and set the city on fire.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the men of A&acute;i began to turn back and look, and there the smoke of the city ascended to the heavens, and there proved to be no ability in them to flee this way or that. And the people that were fleeing to the wilderness turned upon the pursuers.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, and so they turned around and went striking the men of A&acute;i down.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And these others came out of the city to meet them, so that they got to be in between Israel, these on this side and those on that, and they went striking them down until there did not remain of them either a survivor or an escapee.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the king of A&acute;i they caught alive and proceeded to bring him near to Joshua.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And it came about that while Israel was finishing the killing of all the inhabitants of A&acute;i in the field, in the wilderness in which they had pursued them, they kept falling, all of them, by the edge of the sword until they came to their end. After that all Israel returned to A&acute;i and struck it with the edge of the sword.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And all those who fell on that day, from man to woman, amounted to twelve thousand, all the people of A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of A&acute;i to destruction.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Only the domestic animals and the spoil of that city Israel plundered for themselves, according to Jehovah’s word that he had laid in command upon Joshua.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then Joshua burned A&acute;i and reduced it to an indefinitely lasting mound, as a desolation down to this day.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And he hanged the king of A&acute;i upon a stake until the evening time; and as the sun was about to set Joshua gave the command, and then they took his dead body down from the stake and pitched it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised up a great pile of stones over him, down to this day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">It was then that Joshua proceeded to build an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel, in Mount E&acute;bal,</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses: “An altar of whole stones, upon which no iron tool has been wielded”; and they went offering up burnt offerings upon it to Jehovah and sacrificing communion sacrifices.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses that he had written before the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And all Israel and their older men and the officers and their judges were standing on this side and on that side of the Ark in front of the priests, the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, the alien resident as well as the native, one half of them in front of Mount Ger&acute;i&middot;zim and the other half of them in front of Mount E&acute;bal, (just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded,) to bless the people of Israel first of all.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And after this he read aloud all the words of the law, the blessing and the malediction, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">There proved to be not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read aloud in front of all the congregation of Israel, together with the women and the little ones and the alien residents who walked in their midst.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about that as soon as all the kings who were on the side of the Jordan in the mountainous region and in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and along the whole coast of the Great Sea and in front of Leb&acute;a&middot;non, the Hit&acute;tites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites, the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites, heard of it,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">they began to assemble themselves all together to make war against Joshua and Israel unanimously.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the inhabitants of Gib&acute;e&middot;on heard what Joshua had done to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and A&acute;i.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So they, even of their own accord, acted with shrewdness and went and stocked themselves with provisions and took worn-out sacks for their asses, and wine skin-bottles worn out and burst and tied up,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out garments upon themselves, and all the bread of their provisions proved to be dry and crumby.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then they went to Joshua at the camp at Gil&acute;gal and said to him and the men of Israel: “It is from a distant land that we have come. And now <span class="smallcaps">CONCLUDE</span> a covenant with us.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">At this the men of Israel said to the Hi&acute;vites: “Perhaps it is in our vicinity that you are dwelling. So how could we conclude a covenant with you?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In turn they said to Joshua: “We are your servants.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs8-2">Then Joshua said to them: “Who are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and where do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come from?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this they said to him: “It is from a very distant land that your servants have come in regard to the name of Jehovah your God, because we have heard of his fame and of all that he did in Egypt,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and of all that he did to the two kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were on the other side of the Jordan, namely, Si&acute;hon the king of Hesh&acute;bon and Og the king of Ba&acute;shan, who was in Ash&acute;ta&middot;roth.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Hence our older men and all the inhabitants of our land said this to us, ‘Take provisions in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands for the journey and go to meet them, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say to them: “We are <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> servants. And now conclude a covenant with us.”’</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">This bread of ours, it was hot when we took it as our provisions out of our houses on the day of our going out to come here to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and now, look! it is dry and has become crumby.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And these are the wine skin-bottles that we filled new, and, look! they have burst, and these garments and sandals of ours, they have worn out because of the great length of the journey.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Upon that the men took some of their provisions, and at the mouth of Jehovah they did not inquire.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Joshua went making peace with them and concluding a covenant with them to let them live, and so the chieftains of the assembly swore to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it came about that at the end of three days, after they had concluded a covenant with them, they got to hear that they were near to them and it was in their vicinity they were dwelling.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the sons of Israel pulled out and came to their cities on the third day, and their cities were Gib&acute;e&middot;on and Che&middot;phi&acute;rah and Be&middot;er&acute;oth and Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the assembly began to murmur against the chieftains.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">At this all the chieftains said to all the assembly: “We, for our part, have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel, and now we are not allowed to hurt them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">This is what we shall do to them while letting them live, that no indignation may come upon us over the oath that we have sworn to them.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the chieftains said to them: “Let them live and let them become gatherers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly, just as the chieftains have promised them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Joshua now called them and spoke to them, saying: “Why did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> trick us, saying, ‘We are very far away from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,’ whereas <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are dwelling in our very midst?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are cursed people, and a slave’s position and being gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God will never be cut off from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then they answered Joshua and said: “It was because your servants were plainly told that Jehovah your God had commanded Moses his servant to give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all the land and to annihilate all the inhabitants of the land from before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and we became very much afraid for our souls because of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. So we did this thing.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And now here we are, in your hand. Just as it is good and right in your eyes to do to us, do.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he proceeded to do so to them and to deliver them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Accordingly Joshua constituted them on that day gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar, down to this day, at the place that he should choose.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about that as soon as A&middot;do&acute;ni-ze&acute;dek the king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured A&acute;i and then devoted it to destruction, that just as he had done to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and its king, so he had done to A&acute;i and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gib&acute;e&middot;on had made peace with Israel and were continuing in their midst,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">he became very much afraid, because Gib&acute;e&middot;on was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than A&acute;i, and all its men were mighty ones.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Consequently A&middot;do&acute;ni-ze&acute;dek the king of Jerusalem sent to Ho&acute;ham the king of He&acute;bron and to Pi&acute;ram the king of Jar&acute;muth and to Ja&middot;phi&acute;a the king of La&acute;chish and to De&acute;bir the king of Eg&acute;lon, saying,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Come up to me and help me and let us strike Gib&acute;e&middot;on, because it has made peace with Joshua and the sons of Israel.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this they gathered together and went on up, five kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of He&acute;bron, the king of Jar&acute;muth, the king of La&acute;chish, the king of Eg&acute;lon, these and all their camps, and they proceeded to camp against Gib&acute;e&middot;on and to war against it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Upon that the men of Gib&acute;e&middot;on sent to Joshua at the camp at Gil&acute;gal, saying: “Do not let your hand relax from your slaves. Come up to us quickly and do save us and help us, for all the kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites inhabiting the mountainous region have collected together against us.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So Joshua went on up from Gil&acute;gal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant mighty men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid of them, for into your hand I have given them. Not a man of them will stand against you.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Joshua proceeded to come against them by surprise. All night long he had gone up from Gil&acute;gal.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Jehovah went throwing them into confusion before Israel, and they began to slay them with a great slaughter at Gib&acute;e&middot;on and went pursuing them by way of the ascent of Beth-ho&acute;ron and slaying them as far as A&middot;ze&acute;kah and Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about that while they were fleeing from before Israel and were on the descent of Beth-ho&acute;ron, Jehovah hurled great stones from the heavens upon them as far as A&middot;ze&acute;kah, so that they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">It was then that Joshua proceeded to speak to Jehovah on the day of Jehovah’s abandoning the Am&acute;or&middot;ites to the sons of Israel, and he went on to say before the eyes of Israel:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs12-2">“Sun, be motionless over Gib&acute;e&middot;on,<br><span class="p">And, moon, over the low plain of Ai&acute;ja&middot;lon.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Accordingly the sun kept motionless, and the moon did stand still, until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies. Is it not written in the book of Ja&acute;shar? And the sun kept standing still in the middle of the heavens and did not hasten to set for about a whole day.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And no day has proved to be like that one, either before it or after it, in that Jehovah listened to the voice of a man, for Jehovah himself was fighting for Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gil&acute;gal.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Meantime these five kings fled and went hiding themselves in the cave at Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the report was made to Joshua, saying: “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that Joshua said: “R<span class="smallcaps">OLL</span> great stones up to the mouth of the cave and assign men over it to guard them.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, do not stand still. Chase after <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must strike them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities, for Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God has given them into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And it came about that as soon as Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until these came to their end, and those who did survive of them escaped and went entering into the fortified cities,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">all the people then began to return to the camp, to Joshua, at Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah in peace. Not a man moved his tongue eagerly against the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then Joshua said: “O<span class="smallcaps">PEN</span> the mouth of the cave and bring out these five kings from the cave to me.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At that they did so and brought out to him from the cave these five kings, the king of Jerusalem, the king of He&acute;bron, the king of Jar&acute;muth, the king of La&acute;chish, the king of Eg&acute;lon.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And it came about that as soon as they had brought out these kings to Joshua, Joshua proceeded to call all the men of Israel and to say to the commanders of the men of war that had gone with him: “Come forward. Place <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet on the back of the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on the back of their necks.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Joshua went on to say to them: “Do not be afraid or be terrified. Be courageous and strong, for it is like this that Jehovah will do to all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies against whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are warring.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And after that Joshua proceeded to strike them and put them to death and hang them upon five stakes, and they continued hanging upon the stakes until the evening.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And it came about that at the time of the setting of the sun Joshua commanded, and they went taking them down off the stakes and throwing them into the cave where they had hid themselves. Then they placed big stones at the mouth of the cave—until this very day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Joshua captured Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah on that day and went striking it with the edge of the sword. As for its king, he devoted him and every soul that was in it to destruction. He let no survivor remain. So he did to the king of Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah just as he had done to the king of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Mak&middot;ke&acute;dah to Lib&acute;nah and warred against Lib&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Accordingly Jehovah gave it also and its king into Israel’s hand, and they went striking it and every soul that was in it with the edge of the sword. They did not let a survivor remain in it. So they did to its king just as they had done to the king of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Next Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lib&acute;nah to La&acute;chish and went camping against it and warring upon it.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Accordingly Jehovah gave La&acute;chish into Israel’s hand so that they captured it on the second day, and they went striking it and every soul that was in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that they had done to Lib&acute;nah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">It was then that Ho&acute;ram the king of Ge&acute;zer went up to help La&acute;chish. So Joshua struck him and his people until he had let not a survivor of his remain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from La&acute;chish to Eg&acute;lon and went camping against it and warring against it.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And they got to capture it on that day and began to smite it with the edge of the sword, and they devoted every soul that was in it to destruction on that day, according to all that they had done to La&acute;chish.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eg&acute;lon to He&acute;bron and began to war against it.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And they got to capture it and went striking it and its king and all its towns and every soul that was in it with the edge of the sword. He did not let a survivor remain, according to all that he had done to Eg&acute;lon. So he devoted it and every soul that was in it to destruction.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Finally Joshua and all Israel with him came back to De&acute;bir and began to war against it.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And he got to capture it and its king and all its towns, and they went striking them with the edge of the sword and devoting every soul that was in it to destruction. He did not let a survivor remain. Just as he had done to He&acute;bron, so he did to De&acute;bir and its king, and just as he had done to Lib&acute;nah and its king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And Joshua proceeded to strike all the land of the mountainous region and the Neg&acute;eb and the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and the slopes and all their kings. He did not let a survivor remain, and everything that breathed he devoted to destruction, just as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And Joshua went striking them from Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a to Ga&acute;za and all the land of Go&acute;shen and up to Gib&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because it was Jehovah the God of Israel who was fighting for Israel.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">After that Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gil&acute;gal.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about that as soon as Ja&acute;bin the king of Ha&acute;zor heard of it, he went sending to Jo&acute;bab the king of Ma&acute;don and to the king of Shim&acute;ron and the king of Ach&acute;shaph,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and to the kings that were to the north in the mountainous region and in the desert plains south of Chin&acute;ne&middot;reth and in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and on the mountain ridges of Dor to the west,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites to the east and the west, and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites in the mountainous region and the Hi&acute;vites at the base of Her&acute;mon in the land of Miz&acute;pah.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So they went out, they and all their camps with them, a people as numerous as the grains of sand that are on the seashore for multitude, and very many horses and war chariots.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then all these kings met together by appointment and came and encamped together at the waters of Mer&acute;om to fight against Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At this Jehovah said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow about this time I am abandoning all of them slain to Israel. Their horses you will hamstring, and their chariots you will burn in the fire.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Joshua and all the people of war with him proceeded to come against them along the waters of Mer&acute;om by surprise and to fall upon them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then Jehovah gave them into Israel’s hand, and they went striking them and pursuing them as far as populous Si&acute;don and Mis&acute;re&middot;photh-ma&acute;im and the valley plain of Miz&acute;peh to the east; and they kept striking them until they had not let a survivor of theirs remain.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that Joshua did to them just as Jehovah had said to him: their horses he hamstrung, and their chariots he burned in the fire.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">More than that, Joshua turned about at that time and captured Ha&acute;zor; and its king he struck down with the sword, because Ha&acute;zor was before that the head of all these kingdoms.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they went striking every soul that was in it with the edge of the sword, devoting [them] to destruction. No breathing thing at all was left over, and he burned Ha&acute;zor in the fire.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And all the cities of these kings and all their kings Joshua captured and went striking them with the edge of the sword. He devoted them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">It was only all the cities standing on their own mounds that Israel did not burn, except that Joshua did burn Ha&acute;zor by itself.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And all the spoil of these cities and the domestic animals the sons of Israel plundered for themselves. It was only all humankind that they struck with the edge of the sword until they had annihilated them. They did not let anyone that breathed remain.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He did not remove a word from all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Joshua proceeded to take all this land, the mountainous region and all the Neg&acute;eb and all the land of Go&acute;shen and the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah and the mountainous region of Israel and its She&middot;phe&acute;lah,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

       <span id="vs18">Many days it was that Joshua waged war with all these kings.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">There proved to be no city that made peace with the sons of Israel but the Hi&acute;vites inhabiting Gib&acute;e&middot;on. All the others they took by war.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For it proved to be Jehovah’s course to let their hearts become stubborn so as to declare war against Israel, in order that he might devote them to destruction, that they might come to have no favorable consideration, but in order that he might annihilate them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Furthermore, at that particular time Joshua went and cut off the An&acute;a&middot;kim from the mountainous region, from He&acute;bron, from De&acute;bir, from A&acute;nab and from all the mountainous region of Judah and from all the mountainous region of Israel. Along with their cities Joshua devoted them to destruction.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">No An&acute;a&middot;kim were left in the land of the sons of Israel. It was only in Ga&acute;za, in Gath and in Ash&acute;dod that they remained.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So Joshua took all the land, according to all that Jehovah had promised Moses, and Joshua then gave it as an inheritance to Israel by their shares, according to their tribes. And the land had no disturbance from war.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now this is what the sons of Israel took as a hereditary possession in the land of Ca&acute;naan, which El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel caused them to inherit.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Their inheritance was by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses for the nine tribes and the half tribe.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For Moses had given the inheritance of the two other tribes and the other half tribe on the other side of the Jordan; and to the Levites he did not give an inheritance in their midst.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For the sons of Joseph had become two tribes, Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and E&acute;phra&middot;im; and they had not given a share in the land to the Levites, except cities to dwell in and their pasture grounds for their livestock and their property.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did; and they proceeded to apportion the land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua in Gil&acute;gal, and Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh the Ken&acute;iz&middot;zite said to him: “You yourself well know the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of the [true] God with regard to me and with regard to you at Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Forty years old I was when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Ka&acute;desh-bar&acute;ne&middot;a to spy out the land, and I came bringing him back word just as it was in my heart.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And my brothers who went up with me caused the heart of the people to melt; but as for me, I followed Jehovah my God fully.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Consequently Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘The land upon which your foot has trod will become yours and your sons’ as an inheritance to time indefinite, because you have followed Jehovah my God fully.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And now here Jehovah has preserved me alive, just as he promised, these forty-five years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness, and now here I am today eighty-five years old.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Yet I am today as strong as on the day of Moses’ sending me out. As my power was then, so my power is now for the war, both to go out and to come in.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And now do give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day, for you yourself heard on that day that there were An&acute;a&middot;kim there and great fortified cities. Likely Jehovah will be with me, and I shall certainly dispossess them, just as Jehovah promised.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At that Joshua blessed him and gave He&acute;bron to Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh as an inheritance.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">That is why He&acute;bron has come to belong to Ca&acute;leb the son of Je&middot;phun&acute;neh the Ken&acute;iz&middot;zite as an inheritance down to this day, for the reason that he followed Jehovah the God of Israel fully.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">The name of He&acute;bron before that was Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-ar&acute;ba ([said Ar&acute;ba was] the great man among the An&acute;a&middot;kim). And the land had no disturbance from war.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then all the assembly of the sons of Israel were congregated at Shi&acute;loh, and they proceeded to locate the tent of meeting there, as the land was now subdued before them.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But there were still left among the sons of Israel those whose inheritance they had not apportioned out, namely, seven tribes.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Joshua said to the sons of Israel: “How long are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> going to be delinquent about going in to take possession of the land that Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Furnish for yourselves three men of each tribe and let me send them out, that they may get up and walk about in the land and map it out in accord with their inheritance, and let them come to me.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And they must apportion it among themselves into seven shares. Judah will keep standing on his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will keep standing on their territory to the north.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will map out the land into seven shares, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must bring them here to me, and I must cast lots here for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before Jehovah our God.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For the Levites have no share in among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad and Reu&acute;ben and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh have taken their inheritance on the side of the Jordan toward the east, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So the men got up that they might go, and Joshua proceeded to command those who were going to map out the land, saying: “Go and walk about in the land and map it out and return to me, and here is where I shall draw lots for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before Jehovah in Shi&acute;loh.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">With that the men went and passed through the land and mapped it out by cities in seven shares, in a book. After that they came to Joshua at the camp in Shi&acute;loh,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and Joshua went drawing lots for them in Shi&acute;loh before Jehovah. Thus Joshua there apportioned the land to the sons of Israel in their shares.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then the lot came up of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin by their families, and the territory of their lot went out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And their boundary came to be at the northern corner from the Jordan, and the boundary went up to the slope of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho on the north and went up on the mountain westward, and its termination proved to be at the wilderness of Beth-a&acute;ven.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the boundary passed over from there to Luz, at the southern slope of Luz, that is to say, Beth&acute;el; and the boundary went down to At&acute;a&middot;roth-ad&acute;dar upon the mountain that is on the south of Lower Beth-ho&acute;ron.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the boundary was marked out and went around at the western side to the south from the mountain that faces Beth-ho&acute;ron to the south; and its termination proved to be at Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-ba&acute;al, that is to say, Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim, a city of the sons of Judah. This is the western side.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the side to the south was from the extremity of Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim, and the boundary went out westward and went out to the spring of the waters of Neph&middot;to&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom, which is in the low plain of Reph&acute;a&middot;im to the north, and it went down to the valley of Hin&acute;nom, to the slope of the Jeb&acute;u&middot;site on the south, and went down to En-ro&acute;gel.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it was marked out northward and went out to En-she&acute;mesh and went out to Gel&middot;i&acute;loth, which is in front of the ascent of A&middot;dum&acute;mim; and it went down to the stone of Bo&acute;han the son of Reu&acute;ben.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And it passed over to the northern slope in front of the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah and went down to the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the boundary passed over to the northern slope of Beth-hog&acute;lah, and the termination of it (the border) proved to be at the northern bay of the Salt Sea at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the Jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin by their families, by its boundaries all around.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin by their families proved to be Jer&acute;i&middot;cho and Beth-hog&acute;lah and E&acute;mek-ke&acute;ziz,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">and Beth-ar&acute;a&middot;bah and Zem&middot;a&middot;ra&acute;im and Beth&acute;el,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>

       <span id="vs45">Not a promise failed out of all the good promise that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; it all came true.</span>

       <span id="vs1">At that time Joshua proceeded to call the Reu&acute;ben&middot;ites and the Gad&acute;ites and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and to say to them: “For <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were obedient to my voice in all that I have commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have not left <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers these many days down to this day, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have kept the obligation of the commandment of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And now Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God has given <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers rest, just as he promised them. So now turn and go <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tents in the land of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on the other side of the Jordan.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Only be very careful to carry out the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by loving Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God and by walking in all his ways and by keeping his commandments and by cleaving to him and by serving him with all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart and with all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> soul.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">With that Joshua blessed them and sent them away that they might go to their tents.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And to the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh Moses had made a gift in Ba&acute;shan, and to the other half of it Joshua made a gift with their brothers on the side of the Jordan to the west. So, too, when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he proceeded to bless them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he went on to say to them: “Return to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> tents with many riches and with very much livestock, with silver and gold and copper and iron and garments in very great quantity. Take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> share of the spoil of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> enemies together with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh returned and went away from the other sons of Israel, from Shi&acute;loh, which is in the land of Ca&acute;naan, so as to go to the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad, to the land of their possession in which they had been settled at the order of Jehovah by means of Moses.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">When they came to the regions of the Jordan that were in the land of Ca&acute;naan, then the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar great in conspicuousness.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Later on the other sons of Israel heard it said: “Look! The sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of Ca&acute;naan in the regions of the Jordan on the side belonging to the sons of Israel.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When the sons of Israel got to hear of it, the whole assembly of the sons of Israel were then congregated at Shi&acute;loh to go up for military action against them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh in the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and ten chieftains with him, one chieftain of each paternal house of all the tribes of Israel, and they were each a head of the house of their fathers of the thousands of Israel.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In time they came to the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh in the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad and began to speak with them, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“This is what all the assembly of Jehovah have said, ‘What is this act of unfaithfulness that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have perpetrated against the God of Israel in turning back today from following Jehovah by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> building for yourselves an altar, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may rebel today against Jehovah?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Was the error of Pe&acute;or too small for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves down to this day, although the plague came to be upon the assembly of Jehovah?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>—<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would turn back today from following Jehovah; and it must occur that should <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part, rebel today against Jehovah, then tomorrow it will be against the entire assembly of Israel that he will be indignant.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now if it is indeed that the land of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> possession is unclean, make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> way across to the land of Jehovah’s possession where the tabernacle of Jehovah has resided, and get settled in our midst; and against Jehovah do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rebel and do not make us the ones to rebel by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> building for yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of Jehovah our God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Was it not A&acute;chan the son of Ze&acute;rah that perpetrated an act of unfaithfulness in the thing devoted to destruction, and was it not against all the assembly of Israel that there came indignation? And he was not the only man to expire in his error.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At this the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh answered and spoke with the heads of the thousands of Israel:</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Divine One, God, Jehovah, Divine One, God, Jehovah, he is knowing, and Israel, he too will know. If it is in rebellion and if it is in unfaithfulness against Jehovah, do not save us this day.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">If it was to build for ourselves an altar so as to turn back from following Jehovah, and if it was to offer up burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, and if it was to render up communion sacrifices on it, Jehovah himself will search out;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">or if it was not rather out of anxious care for something else that we did this, saying, ‘In a future day <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons will say to our sons: “What do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And there is a boundary that Jehovah has put between us and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad, namely, the Jordan. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have no share in Jehovah.” And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons will certainly make our sons desist from fearing Jehovah.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Hence we said, ‘Let us take action in our behalf, please, by building the altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">but that it may be a witness between us and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and our generations after us that we shall render the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt offerings and our sacrifices and our communion sacrifices, that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons may not say in a future day to our sons: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have no share in Jehovah.”’</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So we said, ‘And it must occur that in case they should say that to us and to our generations in a future day, we must also say: “See the representation of Jehovah’s altar that our fathers made, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, but it is a witness between us and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”’</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">It is unthinkable, on our part, to rebel of our own accord against Jehovah and to turn back today from following Jehovah by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering and sacrifice besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Now when Phin&acute;e&middot;has the priest and the chieftains of the assembly and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard the words that the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh spoke, it came to be good in their eyes.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest said to the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh: “Today we do know that Jehovah is in our midst, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not perpetrated against Jehovah this act of unfaithfulness. Now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">With that Phin&acute;e&middot;has the son of El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the priest and the chieftains returned from the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad in the land of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad to the land of Ca&acute;naan to the other sons of Israel and brought back word to them.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the word came to be good in the eyes of the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel proceeded to bless God, and they did not talk of going up for army service against them to ruin the land in which the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad were dwelling.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And the sons of Reu&acute;ben and the sons of Gad began to name the altar, because “it is a witness between us that Jehovah is the [true] God.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Joshua proceeded to assemble all the tribes of Israel together at She&acute;chem and to call the older men of Israel and its heads and its judges and its officers, and they went taking their stand before the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Joshua went on to say to all the people: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘It was on the other side of the River that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers dwelt a long time ago, Te&acute;rah the father of Abraham and the father of Na&acute;hor, and they used to serve other gods.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“‘In time I took <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefather Abraham from the other side of the River and had him walk through all the land of Ca&acute;naan and made his seed many. So I gave him Isaac.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then to Isaac I gave Jacob and E&acute;sau. Later to E&acute;sau I gave Mount Se&acute;ir to take possession of it; and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later on I sent Moses and Aaron, and I went plaguing Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">When I was bringing <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers out of Egypt and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came to the sea, then the Egyptians went chasing after <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen to the Red Sea.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they began to cry out to Jehovah. So he placed a darkness between <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes got to see what I did in Egypt; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> took up dwelling in the wilderness many days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘Eventually I brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the land of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites who were dwelling on the other side of the Jordan, and they went fighting against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. At that I gave them into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might take possession of their land, and I annihilated them from before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Ba&acute;lak the son of Zip&acute;por, the king of Mo&acute;ab, got up and went fighting against Israel. So he sent and summoned Ba&acute;laam the son of Be&acute;or to call down evil upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And I did not want to listen to Ba&acute;laam. Consequently he blessed <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> repeatedly. Thus I delivered <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of his hand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“‘Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> went crossing the Jordan and came to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho. And the landowners of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho, the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Gir&acute;ga&middot;shites, the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites began fighting against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; but I gave them into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So I sent the feeling of dejection ahead of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and it gradually drove them out before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>—two kings of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites—not with your sword and not with your bow.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Thus I gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a land for which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had not toiled and cities that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had not built, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> took up dwelling in them. Vineyards and olive groves that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not plant are what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are eating.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And now fear Jehovah and serve him in faultlessness and in truth, and remove the gods that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now if it is bad in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will serve, whether the gods that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers who were on the other side of the River served or the gods of the Am&acute;or&middot;ites in whose land <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At this the people answered and said: “It is unthinkable, on our part, to leave Jehovah so as to serve other gods.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For it is Jehovah our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves, and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us in all the way in which we walked and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jehovah proceeded to drive out all the peoples, even the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, dwelling in the land from before us. As for us, too, we shall serve Jehovah, because he is our God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Joshua said to the people: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are not able to serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God; he is a God exacting exclusive devotion. He will not pardon <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> revolting and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sins.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">In case <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should leave Jehovah and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do serve foreign gods, he also will certainly turn back and do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> injury and exterminate <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> after he has done <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> good.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In turn the people said to Joshua: “No, but Jehovah we shall serve!”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At this Joshua said to the people: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are witnesses against yourselves that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own accord have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve him.” To this they said: “We are witnesses.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“And now remove the foreign gods that are among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and incline <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts to Jehovah the God of Israel.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In turn the people said to Joshua: “Jehovah our God we shall serve, and to his voice we shall listen!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Joshua proceeded to conclude a covenant with the people on that day and to constitute for them a regulation and judicial decision in She&acute;chem.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of God’s law and took a great stone and set it up there under the massive tree that is by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And Joshua went on to say to all the people: “Look! This stone is what will serve as a witness against us, because it has itself heard all the sayings of Jehovah that he has spoken with us, and it must serve as a witness against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not deny <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">With that Joshua sent the people away, each one to his inheritance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about that after these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, gradually died at the age of a hundred and ten years.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Tim&acute;nath-se&acute;rah, which is in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im, north of Mount Ga&acute;ash.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Israel continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the older men who extended their days after Joshua and who had known all the work of Jehovah that he did for Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Joseph’s bones, which the sons of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried in She&acute;chem in the tract of the field that Jacob had acquired from the sons of Ha&acute;mor, She&acute;chem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money; and it came to belong to the sons of Joseph as an inheritance.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Also, El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Aaron died. So they buried him in the Hill of Phin&acute;e&middot;has his son, which he had given him in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im.</span>
