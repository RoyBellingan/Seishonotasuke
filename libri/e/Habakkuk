<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The pronouncement that Ha&middot;bak&acute;kuk the prophet visioned:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, and you do not hear? [How long] shall I call to you for aid from violence, and you do not save?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble? And [why] are despoiling and violence in front of me, and [why] does quarreling occur, and [why] is strife carried?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Therefore law grows numb, and justice never goes forth. Because the wicked one is surrounding the righteous one, for that reason justice goes forth crooked.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“See, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, among the nations, and look on, and stare in amazement at one another. Be amazed; for there is an activity that one is carrying on in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> days, [which] <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will not believe although it is related.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For here I am raising up the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, the nation bitter and impetuous, which is going to the wide-open places of earth in order to take possession of residences not belonging to it.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Frightful and fear-inspiring it is. From itself its own justice and its own dignity go forth.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And its horses have proved swifter than leopards, and they have proved fiercer than evening wolves. And its steeds have pawed the ground, and from far away its own steeds come. They fly like the eagle speeding to eat [something].</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In its entirety it comes for mere violence. The assembling of their faces is as [the] east wind, and it gathers up captives just like the sand.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And for its part, it jeers kings themselves, and high officials are something laughable to it. For its part, it laughs even at every fortified place, and it piles up dust and captures it.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At that time it will certainly move onward [like] wind and will pass through and will actually become guilty. This its power is due to its god.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Are you not from long ago, O Jehovah? O my God, my Holy One, you do not die. O Jehovah, for a judgment you have set it; and, O Rock, for a reproving you have founded it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">You are too pure in eyes to see what is bad; and to look on trouble you are not able. Why is it that you look on those dealing treacherously, that you keep silent when someone wicked swallows up someone more righteous than he is?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And [why] do you make earthling man like the fishes of the sea, like creeping things over whom no one is ruling?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">All these he has brought up with a mere fishhook; he drags them away in his dragnet, and he gathers them in his fishing net. That is why he rejoices and is joyful.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">That is why he offers sacrifice to his dragnet and makes sacrificial smoke to his fishing net; for by them his portion is well oiled, and his food is healthful.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Is that why he will empty out his dragnet, and does he have to kill nations constantly, while he shows no compassion?</span>

       <span id="vs3">For [the] vision is yet for the appointed time, and it keeps panting on to the end, and it will not tell a lie. Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it; for it will without fail come true. It will not be late.</span>

And he keeps gathering to himself all the nations and collecting together to himself all the peoples.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Will not these very ones, all of them, lift up against him a proverbial saying and an alluding remark, insinuations at him? And one will say,</span>

       <span id="vs16">You will certainly be satiated with dishonor instead of glory. Drink also, you yourself, and be considered uncircumcised. The cup of the right hand of Jehovah will come around to you, and there will be disgrace upon your glory;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">because the violence [done] to Leb&acute;a&middot;non is what will cover you, and the rapacity upon [the] beasts that terrifies them, because of the shedding of blood of mankind and the violence [done] to [the] earth, the town and all those dwelling in it.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Of what benefit has a carved image been, when the former of it has carved it, a molten statue, and an instructor in falsehood? when the former of its form has trusted in it, to the extent of making valueless gods that are speechless?</span>
