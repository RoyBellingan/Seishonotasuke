       <span id="vs2">to Timothy, a beloved child:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">May there be undeserved kindness, mercy, peace from God [the] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">I am grateful to God, to whom I am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did and with a clean conscience, that I never leave off remembering you in my supplications, night and day</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">longing to see you, as I remember your tears, that I may get filled with joy.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For this very cause I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you through the laying of my hands upon you.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord, neither of me a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not by reason of our works, but by reason of his own purpose and undeserved kindness. This was given us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long lasting,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death but has shed light upon life and incorruption through the good news,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this very cause I am also suffering these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the one whom I have believed, and I am confident he is able to guard what I have laid up in trust with him until that day.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Keep holding the pattern of healthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

       <span id="vs16">May the Lord grant mercy to the household of On&middot;e&middot;siph&acute;o&middot;rus, because he often brought me refreshment, and he did not become ashamed of my chains.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

       <span id="vs1">You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in connection with Christ Jesus,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and the things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus take your part in suffering evil.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order that he may gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Moreover, if anyone contends even in the games, he is not crowned unless he has contended according to the rules.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs7">Give constant thought to what I am saying; the Lord will really give you discernment in all things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead and was of David’s seed, according to the good news I preach;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">in connection with which I am suffering evil to the point of [prison] bonds as an evildoer. Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs13">if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Keep reminding them of these things, charging them before God as witness, not to fight about words, a thing of no usefulness at all because it overturns those listening.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and their word will spread like gangrene. Hy&middot;me&middot;nae&acute;us and Phi&middot;le&acute;tus are of that number.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">These very [men] have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For all that, the solid foundation of God stays standing, having this seal: “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and: “Let everyone naming the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now in a large house there are vessels not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable purpose but others for a purpose lacking honor.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">If, therefore, anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be a vessel for an honorable purpose, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So, flee from the desires incidental to youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Further, turn down foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing they produce fights.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, keeping himself restrained under evil,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed; as perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him for the will of that one.</span>
