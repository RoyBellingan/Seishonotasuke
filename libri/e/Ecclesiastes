       <span id="vs1">The words of the congregator, the son of David the king in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“The greatest vanity!” the congregator has said, “the greatest vanity! Everything is vanity!”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">What profit does a man have in all his hard work at which he works hard under the sun?</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">A generation is going, and a generation is coming; but the earth is standing even to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the sun also has flashed forth, and the sun has set, and it is coming panting to its place where it is going to flash forth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The wind is going to the south, and it is circling around to the north. Round and round it is continually circling, and right back to its circlings the wind is returning.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">All the winter torrents are going forth to the sea, yet the sea itself is not full. To the place where the winter torrents are going forth, there they are returning so as to go forth.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">All things are wearisome; no one is able to speak of it. The eye is not satisfied at seeing, neither is the ear filled from hearing.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">That which has come to be, that is what will come to be; and that which has been done, that is what will be done; and so there is nothing new under the sun.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Does anything exist of which one may say: “See this; it is new”? It has already had existence for time indefinite; what has come into existence is from time prior to us.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">There is no remembrance of people of former times, nor will there be of those also who will come to be later. There will prove to be no remembrance even of them among those who will come to be still later on.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">I, the congregator, happened to be king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I set my heart to seek and explore wisdom in relation to everything that has been done under the heavens—the calamitous occupation that God has given to the sons of mankind in which to be occupied.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I saw all the works that were done under the sun, and, look! everything was vanity and a striving after wind.</span>

       <span id="vs15">That which is made crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot possibly be counted.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">I, even I, spoke with my heart, saying: “Look! I myself have greatly increased in wisdom more than anyone that happened to be before me in Jerusalem, and my own heart saw a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I proceeded to give my heart to knowing wisdom and to knowing madness, and I have come to know folly, that this too is a striving after wind.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For in the abundance of wisdom there is an abundance of vexation, so that he that increases knowledge increases pain.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">I said, even I, in my heart: “Do come now, let me try you out with rejoicing. Also, see good.” And, look! that too was vanity.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">I said to laughter: “Insanity!” and to rejoicing: “What is this doing?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">I explored with my heart by cheering my flesh even with wine, while I was leading my heart with wisdom, even to lay hold on folly until I could see what good there was to the sons of mankind in what they did under the heavens for the number of the days of their life.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I engaged in greater works. I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them fruit trees of all sorts.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest, springing up with trees.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">I acquired menservants and maidservants, and I came to have sons of the household. Also, livestock, cattle and flocks in great quantity I came to have, more so than all those who happened to be before me in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">I accumulated also silver and gold for myself, and property peculiar to kings and the jurisdictional districts. I made male singers and female singers for myself and the exquisite delights of the sons of mankind, a lady, even ladies.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And I became greater and increased more than anyone that happened to be before me in Jerusalem. Moreover, my own wisdom remained mine.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And anything that my eyes asked for I did not keep away from them. I did not hold back my heart from any sort of rejoicing, for my heart was joyful because of all my hard work, and this came to be my portion from all my hard work.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I, even I, turned toward all the works of mine that my hands had done and toward the hard work that I had worked hard to accomplish, and, look! everything was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing of advantage under the sun.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I, even I, turned to see wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the earthling man do who comes in after the king? The thing that people have already done.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I saw, even I, that there exists more advantage for wisdom than for folly, just as there is more advantage for light than for darkness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">As regards anyone wise, his eyes are in his head; but the stupid one is walking on in sheer darkness. And I have come to know, I too, that there is one eventuality that eventuates to them all.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I myself said in my heart: “An eventuality like that upon the stupid one will eventuate to me, yes, me.” Why, then, had I become wise, I overmuch so at that time? And I spoke in my heart: “This too is vanity.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For there is no more remembrance of the wise one than of the stupid one to time indefinite. In the days that are already coming in, everyone is certainly forgotten; and how will the wise one die? Along with the stupid one.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I hated life, because the work that has been done under the sun was calamitous from my standpoint, for everything was vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I, even I, hated all my hard work at which I was working hard under the sun, that I would leave behind for the man who would come to be after me.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And who is there knowing whether he will prove to be wise or foolish? Yet he will take control over all my hard work at which I worked hard and at which I showed wisdom under the sun. This too is vanity.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And I myself turned around toward making my heart despair over all the hard work at which I had worked hard under the sun.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For there exists the man whose hard work has been with wisdom and with knowledge and with proficiency, but to a man that has not worked hard at such a thing will be given the portion of that one. This too is vanity and a big calamity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For what does a man come to have for all his hard work and for the striving of his heart with which he is working hard under the sun?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For all his days his occupation means pains and vexation, also during the night his heart just does not lie down. This too is mere vanity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">With a man there is nothing better [than] that he should eat and indeed drink and cause his soul to see good because of his hard work. This too I have seen, even I, that this is from the hand of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For who eats and who drinks better than I do?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For to the man that is good before him he has given wisdom and knowledge and rejoicing, but to the sinner he has given the occupation of gathering and bringing together merely to give to the one that is good before the [true] God. This too is vanity and a striving after wind.</span>

       <span id="vs17">I myself have said in my heart: “The [true] God will judge both the righteous one and the wicked one, for there is a time for every affair and concerning every work there.”</span>

       <span id="vs19">For there is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast, for everything is vanity.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">All are going to one place. They have all come to be from the dust, and they are all returning to the dust.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Who is there knowing the spirit of the sons of mankind, whether it is ascending upward; and the spirit of the beast, whether it is descending downward to the earth?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And I have seen that there is nothing better than that the man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion; because who will bring him in to look on what is going to be after him?</span>

       <span id="vs1">And I myself returned that I might see all the acts of oppression that are being done under the sun, and, look! the tears of those being oppressed, but they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, so that they had no comforter.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And I congratulated the dead who had already died rather than the living who were still alive.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So better than both of them [is] the one who has not yet come to be, who has not seen the calamitous work that is being done under the sun.</span>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I myself have seen all the hard work and all the proficiency in work, that it means the rivalry of one toward another; this also is vanity and a striving after the wind.</span>

       <span id="vs7">I myself returned that I might see the vanity under the sun:</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">There exists one, but not a second one; also no son or brother does he have, but there is no end to all his hard work. Also, his eyes themselves are not satisfied with riches: “And for whom am I working hard and causing my soul to lack in good things?” This too is vanity, and it is a calamitous occupation.</span>

       <span id="vs10">For if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up. But how will it be with just the one who falls when there is not another to raise him up?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Moreover, if two lie down together, they also will certainly get warm; but how can just one keep warm?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>

       <span id="vs14">For he has gone forth from the prison house itself to become king, although in the kingship of this one he had been born as one of little means.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs16">There is no end to all the people, to all those before whom he happened to be; neither will people afterward rejoice in him, for this too is vanity and a striving after the wind.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the [true] God; and let there be a drawing near to hear, rather than to give a sacrifice as the stupid ones do, for they are not aware of doing what is bad.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Do not hurry yourself as regards your mouth; and as for your heart, let it not be hasty to bring forth a word before the [true] God. For the [true] God is in the heavens but you are on the earth. That is why your words should prove to be few.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For a dream certainly comes in because of abundance of occupation, and the voice of a stupid one because of the abundance of words.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Whenever you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it, for there is no delight in the stupid ones. What you vow, pay.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Better is it that you vow not than that you vow and do not pay.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin, neither say before the angel that it was a mistake. Why should the [true] God become indignant on account of your voice and have to wreck the work of your hands?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For because of abundance [of occupation] there are dreams, and there are vanities and words in abundance. But fear the [true] God himself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">If you see any oppression of the one of little means and the violent taking away of judgment and of righteousness in a jurisdictional district, do not be amazed over the affair, for one that is higher than the high one is watching, and there are those who are high above them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Also, the profit of the earth is among them all; for a field the king himself has been served.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver, neither any lover of wealth with income. This too is vanity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">When good things become many, those eating them certainly become many. And what advantage is there to the grand owner of them, except looking [at them] with his eyes?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Sweet is the sleep of the one serving, regardless of whether it is little or much that he eats; but the plenty belonging to the rich one is not permitting him to sleep.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">There exists a grave calamity that I have seen under the sun: riches being kept for their grand owner to his calamity.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And those riches have perished because of a calamitous occupation, and he has become father to a son when there is nothing at all in his hand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Just as one has come forth from his mother’s belly, naked will one go away again, just as one came; and nothing at all can one carry away for his hard work, which he can take along with his hand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And this too is a grave calamity: exactly as one has come, so one will go away; and what profit is there to the one who keeps working hard for the wind?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Also, all his days he eats in darkness itself, with a great deal of vexation, with sickness on his part and [cause for] indignation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Look! The best thing that I myself have seen, which is pretty, is that one should eat and drink and see good for all his hard work with which he works hard under the sun for the number of the days of his life that the [true] God has given him, for that is his portion.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Also every man to whom the [true] God has given riches and material possessions, he has even empowered him to eat from it and to carry off his portion and to rejoice in his hard work. This is the gift of God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For not often will he remember the days of his life, because the [true] God is preoccupying [him] with the rejoicing of his heart.</span>

       <span id="vs3">If a man should become a father a hundred times, and he should live many years, so that numerous the days of his years should become, yet his own soul is not satisfied with good things and even the grave has not become his, I must say that one prematurely born is better off than he is.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For in vain has this one come and in darkness he goes away, and with darkness his own name will be covered.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Even the sun itself he has not seen, neither known. This one has rest rather than the former one.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Even supposing that he has lived a thousand years twice over and yet he has not seen what is good, is it not to just one place that everyone is going?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">All the hard work of mankind is for their mouth, but even their own soul does not get filled.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For what advantage does the wise have over the stupid one? What does the afflicted one have in knowing how to walk in front of the living ones?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Better is the seeing by the eyes than the walking about of the soul. This too is vanity and a striving after the wind.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Whatever has come to be, its name has already been pronounced, and it has become known what man is; and he is not able to plead his cause with one that is more powerful than he is.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Because there exist many things that are causing much vanity, what advantage does a man have?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For who is there knowing what good a man has in life for the number of the days of his vain life, when he spends them like a shadow? For who can tell man what will happen after him under the sun?</span>

       <span id="vs1">A name is better than good oil, and the day of death than the day of one’s being born.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Better is it to go to the house of mourning than to go to the banquet house, because that is the end of all mankind; and the one alive should take [it] to his heart.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Better is vexation than laughter, for by the crossness of the face the heart becomes better.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">The heart of the wise ones is in the house of mourning, but the heart of the stupid ones is in the house of rejoicing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Better is it to hear the rebuke of someone wise than to be the man hearing the song of the stupid ones.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For as the sound of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the stupid one; and this too is vanity.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For mere oppression may make a wise one act crazy, and a gift can destroy the heart.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Better is the end afterward of a matter than its beginning. Better is one who is patient than one who is haughty in spirit.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Do not hurry yourself in your spirit to become offended, for the taking of offense is what rests in the bosom of the stupid ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Do not say: “Why has it happened that the former days proved to be better than these?” for it is not due to wisdom that you have asked about this.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Wisdom along with an inheritance is good and is advantageous for those seeing the sun.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For wisdom is for a protection [the same as] money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">See the work of the [true] God, for who is able to make straight what he has made crooked?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">On a good day prove yourself to be in goodness, and on a calamitous day see that the [true] God has made even this exactly as that, to the intent that mankind may not discover anything at all after them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Everything I have seen during my vain days. There exists the righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there exists the wicked one continuing long in his badness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Do not become righteous overmuch, nor show yourself excessively wise. Why should you cause desolation to yourself?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Do not be wicked overmuch, nor become foolish. Why should you die when it is not your time?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">It is better that you should take hold of the one, but from the other also do not withdraw your hand; for he that fears God will go forth with them all.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Wisdom itself is stronger for the wise one than ten men in power who happened to be in a city.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For there is no man righteous in the earth that keeps doing good and does not sin.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Also, do not give your heart to all the words that people may speak, that you may not hear your servant calling down evil upon you.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For your own heart well knows even many times that you, even you, have called down evil upon others.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">All this I have tested with wisdom. I said: “I will become wise.” But it was far from me.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">What has come to be is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">I myself turned around, even my heart did, to know and to explore and to search for wisdom and the reason of things, and to know about the wickedness of stupidity and the foolishness of madness;</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">and I was finding out: More bitter than death [I found] the woman who is herself nets for hunting and whose heart is dragnets [and] whose hands are fetters. One is good before the [true] God if one escapes from her, but one is sinning if one is captured by her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“See! This I have found,” said the congregator, “one thing [taken] after another, to find out the sum-up,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">which my soul has continuously sought, but I have not found. One man out of a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">See! This only I have found, that the [true] God made mankind upright, but they themselves have sought out many plans.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Who is there like the wise one? And who is there knowing the interpretation of a thing? The wisdom of a man itself causes his face to shine, and even the sternness of his face is changed [for the better].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">I [say:] “Keep the very order of the king, and that out of regard for the oath of God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Do not hurry yourself, that you may go out from before him. Do not stand in a bad thing. For all that he delights [to do] he will do,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">because the word of the king is the power of control; and who may say to him: ‘What are you doing?’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">He that is keeping the commandment will not know any calamitous thing, and the wise heart will know both time and judgment.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For there exists a time and judgment even for every affair, because the calamity of mankind is abundant upon them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For there is no one knowing what will come to be, because who can tell him just how it will come to be?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">There is no man having power over the spirit to restrain the spirit; neither is there any power of control in the day of death; nor is there any discharge in the war. And wickedness will provide no escape for those indulging in it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">All this I have seen, and there was an applying of my heart to every work that has been done under the sun, [during] the time that man has dominated man to his injury.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But, though this is so, I have seen the wicked ones being buried, how they came in and how they would go away from the holy place itself and be forgotten in the city where they acted that way. This too is vanity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Although a sinner may be doing bad a hundred times and continuing a long time as he pleases, yet I am also aware that it will turn out well with those fearing the [true] God, because they were in fear of him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But it will not turn out well at all with the wicked one, neither will he prolong his days that are like a shadow, because he is not in fear of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">There exists a vanity that is carried out on the earth, that there exist righteous ones to whom it is happening as if for the work of the wicked ones, and there exist wicked ones to whom it is happening as if for the work of the righteous ones. I said that this too is vanity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I myself commended rejoicing, because mankind have nothing better under the sun than to eat and drink and rejoice, and that it should accompany them in their hard work for the days of their life, which the [true] God has given them under the sun.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In accord with this I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the occupation that is carried on in the earth, because there is one seeing no sleep with his eyes, either by day or by night.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I saw all the work of the [true] God, how mankind are not able to find out the work that has been done under the sun; however much mankind keep working hard to seek, yet they do not find out. And even if they should say they are wise enough to know, they would be unable to find out.</span>

<p class="title">Ecclesiastes 9:1-18</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="12">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="18">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For I took all this to my heart, even to search out all this, that the righteous ones and the wise ones and their works are in the hand of the [true] God. Mankind are not aware of either the love or the hate that were all prior to them.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">All are the same in what all have. One eventuality there is to the righteous one and the wicked one, the good one and the clean one and the unclean one, and the one sacrificing and the one that is not sacrificing. The good one is the same as the sinner; the one swearing is the same as whoever has been afraid of a sworn oath.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">This is what is calamitous in all that has been done under the sun, that, because there is one eventuality to all, the heart of the sons of men is also full of bad; and there is madness in their heart during their lifetime, and after it—to the dead ones!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For as respects whoever is joined to all the living there exists confidence, because a live dog is better off than a dead lion.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they have no portion anymore to time indefinite in anything that has to be done under the sun.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Go, eat your food with rejoicing and drink your wine with a good heart, because already the [true] God has found pleasure in your works.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">On every occasion let your garments prove to be white, and let oil not be lacking upon your head.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">See life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life that He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity, for that is your portion in life and in your hard work with which you are working hard under the sun.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in She&acute;ol, the place to which you are going.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">I returned to see under the sun that the swift do not have the race, nor the mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food, nor do the understanding ones also have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For man also does not know his time. Just like fishes that are being taken in an evil net, and like birds that are being taken in a trap, so the sons of men themselves are being ensnared at a calamitous time, when it falls upon them suddenly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Also this I saw as respects wisdom under the sun—and it was great to me:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">There was a little city, and the men in it were few; and there came to it a great king, and he surrounded it and built against it great strongholds.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And there was found in it a man, needy [but] wise, and that one provided escape for the city by his wisdom. But no man remembered that needy man.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I myself said: “Wisdom is better than mightiness; yet the wisdom of the needy one is despised, and his words are not listened to.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">The words of the wise ones in quietness are more to be heard than the cry of one ruling among stupid people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Wisdom is better than implements for fighting, and merely one sinner can destroy much good.</span>

       <span id="vs5">There exists something calamitous that I have seen under the sun, as when there is a mistake going forth on account of the one in power:</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Foolishness has been put in many high positions, but the rich ones themselves keep dwelling merely in a low condition.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come, or the years have arrived when you will say: “I have no delight in them”;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds have returned, afterward the downpour;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the men of vital energy have bent themselves, and the grinding women have quit working because they have become few, and the ladies seeing at the windows have found it dark;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and the doors onto the street have been closed, when the sound of the grinding mill becomes low, and one gets up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song sound low.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Also, they have become afraid merely at what is high, and there are terrors in the way. And the almond tree carries blossoms, and the grasshopper drags itself along, and the caper berry bursts, because man is walking to his long-lasting house and the wailers have marched around in the street;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">before the silver cord is removed, and the golden bowl gets crushed, and the jar at the spring is broken, and the waterwheel for the cistern has been crushed.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then the dust returns to the earth just as it happened to be and the spirit itself returns to the [true] God who gave it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“The greatest vanity!” said the congregator, “Everything is vanity.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And besides the fact that the congregator had become wise, he also taught the people knowledge continually, and he pondered and made a thorough search, that he might arrange many proverbs in order.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The congregator sought to find the delightful words and the writing of correct words of truth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The words of the wise ones are like oxgoads, and just like nails driven in are those indulging in collections [of sentences]; they have been given from one shepherd.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">As regards anything besides these, my son, take a warning: To the making of many books there is no end, and much devotion [to them] is wearisome to the flesh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the [true] God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole [obligation] of man.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the [true] God himself will bring every sort of work into the judgment in relation to every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad.</span>
