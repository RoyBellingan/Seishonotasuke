       <span id="vs1">And the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, for their part, made war upon Israel; and the men of Israel went fleeing from before the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and kept falling slain in Mount Gil&middot;bo&acute;a.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines kept in close range of Saul and his sons; and the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines got to strike down Jon&acute;a&middot;than and A&middot;bin&acute;a&middot;dab and Mal&acute;chi-shu&acute;a, sons of Saul.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the fighting became heavy against Saul; and those shooting with the bow finally found him, and he got wounded by the shooters.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Saul said to his armor-bearer: “Draw your sword and run me through with it, that these uncircumcised men may not come and certainly deal abusively with me.” And his armor-bearer was unwilling, because he was very much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell upon it.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">When his armor-bearer saw that Saul had died, then he too fell upon the sword and died.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Thus Saul and three sons of his died, and all those of his house died together.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">When all the men of Israel that were in the low plain saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, then they began to leave their cities and flee; after which the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines came on in and took up dwelling in them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about the next day that, when the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines came to strip the slain, they got to find Saul and his sons fallen upon Mount Gil&middot;bo&acute;a.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And they proceeded to strip him and take off his head and his armor and send into the land of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines all around to inform their idols and the people.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Finally they put his armor in the house of their god, and his skull they fastened to the house of Da&acute;gon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all those of Ja&acute;besh in Gil&acute;e&middot;ad got to hear of all that the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines had done to Saul.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So all the valiant men rose up and carried off the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons and brought them to Ja&acute;besh and buried their bones under the big tree in Ja&acute;besh; and they went fasting for seven days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Thus Saul died for his unfaithfulness with which he had acted faithlessly against Jehovah concerning the word of Jehovah that he had not kept and also for asking of a spirit medium to make inquiry.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he did not inquire of Jehovah. Consequently he put him to death and turned the kingship over to David the son of Jes&acute;se.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="47">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In time all the Israelites collected themselves together to David at He&acute;bron, saying: “Look! We are your bone and your flesh.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Both yesterday and previously, even while Saul happened to be king, you were the one leading Israel out and bringing it in; and Jehovah your God proceeded to say to you, ‘You yourself will shepherd my people Israel, and you yourself will become leader over my people Israel.’”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So all the older men of Israel came to the king at He&acute;bron and David concluded a covenant with them in He&acute;bron before Jehovah; after which they anointed David as king over Israel, according to Jehovah’s word by means of Samuel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Later David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is to say, Je&acute;bus, where the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites were the inhabitants of the land.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the inhabitants of Je&acute;bus began to say to David: “You will not come in here.” Just the same, David proceeded to capture the stronghold of Zion, that is to say, the City of David.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So David said: “Anyone striking the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites first, he will become head and prince.” And Jo&acute;ab the son of Ze&middot;ru&acute;iah got to go up first, and he came to be head.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And David took up dwelling in the place difficult to approach. That is why they called it the City of David.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he began to build the city all around, from the Mound even to the parts round about, but Jo&acute;ab himself brought to life the rest of the city.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And David went on getting greater and greater, for Jehovah of armies was with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now these are the heads of the mighty men that belonged to David, holding strongly with him in his kingship together with all Israel, to make him king according to Jehovah’s word concerning Israel.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And this is the list of the mighty men that belonged to David: Ja&middot;sho&acute;be&middot;am the son of a Hach&acute;mon&middot;ite, the head of the three. He was brandishing his spear over three hundred slain at one time.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And after him there was El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Do&acute;do the A&middot;ho&acute;hite. He was among the three mighty men.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">He it was that happened to be with David at Pas-dam&acute;mim, where the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines had gathered themselves together for war. Now there happened to be a tract of the field full of barley, and the people, for their part, had fled because of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But he took his stand in the middle of the tract and delivered it, and kept striking down the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, so that Jehovah saved with a great salvation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And three of the thirty head ones proceeded to go down to the rock, to David at the cave of A&middot;dul&acute;lam, while a camp of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines was camping in the low plain of Reph&acute;a&middot;im.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And David was then in the place hard to approach; and a garrison of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines was then in Beth&acute;le&middot;hem.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">After a while David showed his craving and said: “O that I might have a drink of the water from the cistern of Beth&acute;le&middot;hem, which is at the gate!”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that the three forced their way into the camp of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and drew water from the cistern of Beth&acute;le&middot;hem, which is at the gate, and came carrying and bringing it to David. And David did not consent to drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he went on to say: “It is unthinkable on my part, as regards my God, to do this! Is it the blood of these men that I should drink at the risk of their souls? For it was at the risk of their souls that they brought it.” And he did not consent to drink it. These are the things that the three mighty men did.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for A&middot;bish&acute;ai the brother of Jo&acute;ab, he himself became head of the three; and he was brandishing his spear over three hundred slain, and he had a reputation like the three.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Of the three he was more distinguished than the two others, and he came to be a chief to them; and yet he did not come up to the [first] three.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">As for Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da, the son of a valiant man, who did many deeds in Kab&acute;ze&middot;el, he himself struck down the two [sons] of Ar&acute;i&middot;el of Mo&acute;ab; and he himself descended and struck down a lion inside a waterpit in the day of snowfall.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he it was that struck down the Egyptian man, a man of extraordinary size, of five cubits. And in the hand of the Egyptian there was a spear like the beam of loom workers; yet he went on down to him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">These things Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Although he was more distinguished than the thirty, yet to the rank of the [first] three he did not come. However, David put him over his own bodyguard.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As for the mighty men of the military forces, there were As&acute;a&middot;hel the brother of Jo&acute;ab, El&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Do&acute;do of Beth&acute;le&middot;hem,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>

       <span id="vs2">and David went on to say to all the congregation of Israel: “If it seems good to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and it is acceptable with Jehovah our God, let us send to our brothers that are left over in all the lands of Israel and with them [to] the priests and the Levites in their cities with pasture grounds, that they may collect themselves together to us.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And let us bring the ark of our God around to ourselves.” For they had not cared for it in the days of Saul.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So all the congregation said to do that way, for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly David congregated all Israel from the river of Egypt as far as the entering of Ha&acute;math, to bring the ark of the [true] God from Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim.</span>

       <span id="vs7">However, they had the ark of the [true] God ride upon a new wagon from the house of A&middot;bin&acute;a&middot;dab, and Uz&acute;zah and A&middot;hi&acute;o were leading the wagon.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>

       <span id="vs9">And they came gradually as far as the threshing floor of Chi&acute;don, and Uz&acute;zah now thrust his hand out to grab hold of the Ark, for the bulls nearly caused an upset.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">At that Jehovah’s anger blazed against Uz&acute;zah, so that he struck him down because he had thrust his hand out upon the Ark, and he died there before God.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And David became angry because Jehovah had broken through in a rupture against Uz&acute;zah; and that place came to be called Pe&acute;rez-uz&acute;zah down to this day.</span>

       <span id="vs14">And the ark of the [true] God kept dwelling with the household of O&acute;bed-e&acute;dom, at his house three months; and Jehovah kept blessing the household of O&acute;bed-e&acute;dom and all that was his.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Hi&acute;ram the king of Tyre proceeded to send messengers to David and cedar timbers and builders of walls and workers in wood to build him a house.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And David came to know that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel, for his kingship was highly exalted on account of his people Israel.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs3">And David went on to take more wives in Jerusalem, and David came to be father to more sons and daughters.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And these are the names of the children that became his in Jerusalem: Sham&middot;mu&acute;a and Sho&acute;bab, Nathan and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines got to hear that David had been anointed as king over all Israel. At that all the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines came up to look for David. When David heard of it, then he went out against them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, for their part, came in and kept making raids in the low plain of Reph&acute;a&middot;im.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And David began to inquire of God, saying: “Shall I go up against the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, and will you certainly give them into my hand?” At this Jehovah said to him: “Go up, and I shall certainly give them into your hand.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So David went up to Ba&acute;al-pe&middot;ra&acute;zim and there got to strike them down.

       <span id="vs12">Consequently they left their gods there. Then David said [the word], and so they were burned in the fire.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Later the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines once again made a raid in the low plain.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At that David inquired again of God, and the [true] God now said to him: “You must not go up after them. Go around from directly against them, and you must come at them in front of the ba&acute;ca bushes.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And let it occur that, when you hear the sound of the marching in the tops of the ba&acute;ca bushes, then you go out into the fight, because the [true] God will have gone out before you to strike the camp of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines down.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So David did just as the [true] God had commanded him, and they went striking down the camp of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines from Gib&acute;e&middot;on to Ge&acute;zer.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And David’s fame began to go out into all the lands, and Jehovah himself put the dread of him upon all the nations.</span>

       <span id="vs2">Upon that Nathan said to David: “Everything that is in your heart do, for the [true] God is with you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it came about on that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Go, and you must say to David my servant, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “It will not be you that will build me the house in which to dwell.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought Israel up until this day, but I continued from tent to tent and from one tabernacle [to another].</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs8">And I shall prove to be with you wherever you do walk, and I shall cut off all your enemies from before you, and I shall certainly make for you a name like the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And I shall certainly appoint a place for my people Israel and plant them, and they will indeed reside where they are and no more will they be disturbed; and the sons of unrighteousness will not wear them out again, just as they did at the first,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">even since the days that I put judges in command over my people Israel. And I shall certainly humble all your enemies. And I tell you, ‘Also a house Jehovah will build for you.’</span>

       <span id="vs18">What more could David say to you as to honoring your servant, when you yourself know your servant well?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs21">And what other nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom the [true] God went to redeem to himself as a people, to assign to yourself a name of great achievements and fear-inspiring things by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed from Egypt?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And you proceeded to constitute your people Israel as your people to time indefinite, and you yourself, O Jehovah, became their God.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And now, O Jehovah, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house prove faithful to time indefinite, and do just as you have spoken.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And let your name prove faithful and become great to time indefinite, saying, ‘Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, is God to Israel,’ and let the house of David your servant be one lasting before you.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For you yourself, my God, have revealed to your servant the purpose to build him a house. That is why your servant has found occasion to pray before you.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And now, O Jehovah, you are the [true] God, and you promise this goodness concerning your servant.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And now you must take it upon yourself and bless the house of your servant [for it] to continue to time indefinite before you; for you yourself, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed to time indefinite.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And it came about afterward that Na&acute;hash the king of the sons of Am&acute;mon came to die, and his son began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At that David said: “I shall exercise loving-kindness toward Ha&acute;nun the son of Na&acute;hash, because his father exercised loving-kindness toward me.” Accordingly David sent messengers to comfort him over his father, and the servants of David proceeded to come into the land of the sons of Am&acute;mon to Ha&acute;nun to comfort him.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">However, the princes of the sons of Am&acute;mon said to Ha&acute;nun: “Is David honoring your father in your eyes in that he has sent comforters to you? Is it not for the sake of making a thorough search and causing an overthrow and for spying out the land that his servants have come in to you?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So Ha&acute;nun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut their garments in half to their buttocks and sent them away.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later people went and told David about the men; and he at once sent to meet them, because they had become men very much humiliated; and the king went on to say: “Dwell in Jer&acute;i&middot;cho until <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> beards grow abundantly. Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must return.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In time the sons of Am&acute;mon saw that they had become foul-smelling to David, and Ha&acute;nun and the sons of Am&acute;mon proceeded to send a thousand silver talents to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mes&middot;o&middot;po&middot;ta&acute;mi&middot;a and from A&acute;ram-ma&acute;a&middot;cah and from Zo&acute;bah.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Thus they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Ma&acute;a&middot;cah and his people. Then they came in and camped before Med&acute;e&middot;ba; and as for the sons of Am&acute;mon, they gathered together from their cities and now came in for the war.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When David heard of it, he immediately sent Jo&acute;ab and all the army [and] the mighty men.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the sons of Am&acute;mon began to go out and draw up in battle formation at the entrance of the city, and the kings that had come were by themselves in the open field.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">When Jo&acute;ab saw that the battle charges had come to be against him from the front and from the rear, he at once chose some of all the choice men in Israel and drew them up in formation to meet the Syrians.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of A&middot;bish&acute;ai his brother, that they might draw up in formation to meet the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he went on to say: “If the Syrians become too strong for me, you must also serve as a salvation for me; but if the sons of Am&acute;mon themselves become too strong for you, I must also save you.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Be strong, that we may show ourselves courageous in behalf of our people and in behalf of the cities of our God; and as for Jehovah, what is good in his own eyes he will do.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then Jo&acute;ab and the people that were with him advanced before the Syrians to the battle, and they took to flight from before him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As for the sons of Am&acute;mon, they saw that the Syrians had fled, and they themselves also took to flight from before A&middot;bish&acute;ai his brother and then came into the city. Later Jo&acute;ab came into Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated before Israel, they proceeded to send messengers and bring out the Syrians that were in the region of the River, with Sho&acute;phach the chief of the army of Had&middot;ad&middot;e&acute;zer before them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up in formation against them. When David drew up in battle formation to meet the Syrians, they began to fight against him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But the Syrians took to flight because of Israel; and David went killing of the Syrians seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand men on foot, and Sho&acute;phach the chief of the army himself he put to death.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When the servants of Had&middot;ad&middot;e&acute;zer saw that they had been defeated before Israel, they promptly made peace with David and began to serve him; and Syria did not want to try saving the sons of Am&acute;mon anymore.</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="29">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="30">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Satan proceeded to stand up against Israel and to incite David to number Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So David said to Jo&acute;ab and the chiefs of the people: “Go, count Israel from Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba to Dan and bring it to me that I may know their number.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But Jo&acute;ab said: “May Jehovah add to his people a hundred times as many as they are. Do they not, O my lord the king, all of them belong to my lord as servants? Why does my lord seek this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">The king’s word, however, prevailed over Jo&acute;ab, so that Jo&acute;ab went out and walked through all Israel, after which he came to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Jo&acute;ab now gave the number of the registration of the people to David; and all Israel amounted to a million one hundred thousand men drawing sword, and Judah four hundred and seventy thousand men drawing sword.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Le&acute;vi and Benjamin he did not register in among them, because the king’s word had been detestable to Jo&acute;ab.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now this thing was bad in the eyes of the [true] God, and so he struck down Israel.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Consequently David said to the [true] God: “I have sinned very much in that I have done this thing. And now, please, cause your servant’s error to pass away; for I have acted very foolishly.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Gad, David’s visionary, saying:</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Go, and you must speak to David, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “There are three things that I am directing against you. Choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Accordingly Gad went in to David and said to him: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Take your pick,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">whether for three years there is to be a famine; or for three months there is to be a sweeping away from before your adversaries and for the sword of your enemies to overtake [you], or for three days there is to be the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence, in the land, with Jehovah’s angel bringing ruin in all the territory of Israel.’ And now see what I should reply to the One sending me.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So David said to Gad: “It is very distressing to me. Please, let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for very many are his mercies; but into the hand of man do not let me fall.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then Jehovah gave a pestilence in Israel, so that out of Israel seventy thousand persons fell.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Moreover, the [true] God sent an angel to Jerusalem to bring ruin to it; and as soon as he began bringing the ruin, Jehovah saw it and began to feel regret over the calamity; and so he said to the angel that was bringing the ruin: “It is enough! Now let your hand drop.” And Jehovah’s angel was standing close by the threshing floor of Or&acute;nan the Jeb&acute;u&middot;site.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When David raised his eyes, he got to see Jehovah’s angel standing between the earth and the heavens with his drawn sword in his hand extended toward Jerusalem; and David and the older men, covered with sackcloth, at once fell down upon their faces.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And David proceeded to say to the [true] God: “Was it not I that said to make a numbering of the people, and is it not I that have sinned and have unquestionably done bad? As for these sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let your hand, please, come to be upon me and my father’s house; but not upon your people, for a scourge.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jehovah’s angel, for his part, said to Gad to say to David that David should go up to erect an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Or&acute;nan the Jeb&acute;u&middot;site.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Accordingly David went up at the word of Gad that he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Meantime, Or&acute;nan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons with him were hiding themselves. Now Or&acute;nan had been threshing wheat.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So David came as far as Or&acute;nan. When Or&acute;nan looked and saw David, he immediately went out of the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the earth.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then David said to Or&acute;nan: “Do give me the place of the threshing floor, that I may build in it an altar to Jehovah. For the money in full give it to me, that the scourge may be halted from upon the people.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But Or&acute;nan said to David: “Take it as your own, and let my lord the king do what is good in his own eyes. See, I do give the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering. The whole I do give.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, King David said to Or&acute;nan: “No, but without fail I shall make the purchase for the money in full, because I shall not carry what is yours to Jehovah to offer up burnt sacrifices without cost.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So David gave Or&acute;nan for the place gold shekels to the weight of six hundred.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then David built there an altar to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices, and he proceeded to call upon Jehovah, who now answered him with fire from the heavens upon the altar of burnt offering.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Moreover, Jehovah said the word to the angel, who accordingly returned his sword to its sheath.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Or&acute;nan the Jeb&acute;u&middot;site, he continued to sacrifice there.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gib&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And David had not been able to go before it to consult God, for he had been terrified because of the sword of Jehovah’s angel.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then David said: “This is the house of Jehovah the [true] God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">David now said to bring together the alien residents that were in the land of Israel, and then he set them as stone hewers to hew squared stones for building the house of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps David prepared, and also copper in such quantity as to be beyond weighing,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and also cedar timbers without number; for the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans and the Tyr&acute;i&middot;ans brought in cedar timbers in great quantity to David.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly David said: “Sol&acute;o&middot;mon my son is young and delicate, and the house to be built to Jehovah is to be surpassingly magnificent for beauteous distinction to all the lands. Let me, then, make preparation for him.” So David made preparation in great quantities before his death.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Moreover, he called Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son that he might command him to build a house to Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And David went on to say to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son: “As for myself, it became close to my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But Jehovah’s word came against me, saying, ‘Blood in great quantity you have spilled, and great wars you have waged. You will not build a house to my name, for a great deal of blood you have spilled on the earth before me.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Look! There is a son being born to you. He himself will prove to be a restful man, and I shall certainly give him rest from all his enemies all around; for Sol&acute;o&middot;mon is what his name will become, and peace and quietness I shall bestow upon Israel in his days.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">It is he that will build a house to my name, and he himself will become a son to me, and I a father to him. And I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingship firmly over Israel to time indefinite.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Now, my son, may Jehovah prove to be with you, and you must prove successful and build the house of Jehovah your God, just as he has spoken concerning you.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Only may Jehovah give you discretion and understanding, and may he give you commandment concerning Israel even to keep the law of Jehovah your God.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In that case you will prove successful if you take care to carry out the regulations and the judicial decisions that Jehovah commanded Moses respecting Israel. Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And here during my affliction I have prepared for Jehovah’s house a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver, and the copper and the iron there is no means of weighing because they have come to be in such quantity; and timbers and stones I have prepared, but to them you will make additions.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And with you there are in great number doers of work, stone hewers and workers in stone and wood and every one skillful in every sort of work.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The gold, the silver and the copper and the iron there is no means of numbering. Rise and act, and may Jehovah prove to be with you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And David went on to command all the princes of Israel to help Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Is not Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and has he not given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> rest all around?

       <span id="vs19">Now set <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> soul to inquire after Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and rise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah the [true] God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy utensils of the [true] God to the house built to the name of Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And according to all my power I have prepared for the house of my God the gold for the goldwork, and the silver for the silverwork, and the copper for the copperwork, the iron for the ironwork, and the timbers for the timberwork; onyx stones, and stones to be set with hard mortar, and mosaic pebbles, and every precious stone, and alabaster stones in great quantity.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And since I am taking pleasure in the house of my God, there is yet a special property of mine, gold and silver; I do give it to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">three thousand talents of gold of the gold of O&acute;phir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for coating the walls of the houses;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">of the gold for the goldwork, and of the silver for the silverwork and for all the work by the hand of the craftsmen. And who is there volunteering to fill his hand today [with a gift] for Jehovah?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the princes of the paternal houses and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds and the chiefs of the business of the king proceeded to volunteer.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Accordingly they gave to the service of the house of the [true] God gold worth five thousand talents and ten thousand darics and silver worth ten thousand talents and copper worth eighteen thousand talents and iron worth a hundred thousand talents.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And what stones were found with any persons they gave to the treasure of the house of Jehovah under the control of Je&middot;hi&acute;el the Ger&acute;shon&middot;ite.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah; and even David the king himself rejoiced with great joy.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Consequently David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation and David said: “Blessed may you be, O Jehovah the God of Israel our father, from time indefinite even to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the excellency and the dignity; for everything in the heavens and in the earth is [yours]. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the One also lifting yourself up as head over all.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The riches and the glory are on account of you, and you are dominating everything; and in your hand there are power and mightiness, and in your hand is [ability] to make great and to give strength to all.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And now, O our God, we are thanking you and praising your beauteous name.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And yet, who am I and who are my people, that we should retain power to make voluntary offerings like this? For everything is from you, and out of your own hand we have given to you.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For we are alien residents before you and settlers the same as all our forefathers. Like a shadow our days are upon the earth and there is no hope.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name, from your hand it is, and to you it all belongs.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things, and now your people who are on hand here I have enjoyed seeing make offerings voluntarily to you.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel our forefathers, do keep this to time indefinite as the inclination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their heart to you.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon my son give a complete heart to keep your commandments, your testimonies and your regulations, and to do everything, and to build the castle for which I have made preparation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And David went on to say to all the congregation: “Bless, now, Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.” And all the congregation proceeded to bless Jehovah the God of their forefathers and bow low and prostrate themselves to Jehovah and to the king.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they continued to sacrifice sacrifices to Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the day following that day, a thousand young bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand male lambs and their drink offerings, even sacrifices in great number for all Israel.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And they continued eating and drinking before Jehovah on that day with great rejoicing; and they proceeded a second time to make Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the son of David king and to anoint him to Jehovah as leader and also Za&acute;dok as priest.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon began to sit upon Jehovah’s throne as king in place of David his father and to make a success of it, and all the Israelites were obedient to him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">As for all the princes and the mighty men and also all the sons of King David, they submitted themselves to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the king.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Jehovah continued to make Sol&acute;o&middot;mon surpassingly great before the eyes of all Israel and to put upon him such royal dignity as had not come to be upon any king before him over Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As for David the son of Jes&acute;se, he reigned over all Israel;</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years. In He&acute;bron he reigned for seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three [years].</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And gradually he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and glory; and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">As for the affairs of David the king, the first ones and the last, there they are written among the words of Samuel the seer and among the words of Nathan the prophet and among the words of Gad the visionary,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">together with all his kingship and his mightiness and the times that had passed over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the lands.</span>
