<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="51">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In [the] beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This one was in [the] beginning with God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">What has come into existence</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">There arose a man that was sent forth as a representative of God: his name was John.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">This [man] came for a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, that people of all sorts might believe through him.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">He was not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">However, as many as did receive him, to them he gave authority to become God’s children, because they were exercising faith in his name;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of undeserved kindness and truth.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">(John bore witness about him, yes, he actually cried out—this was the one who said [it]—saying: “The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.”)</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For we all received from out of his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom [position] with the Father is the one that has explained him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now this is the witness of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him to ask him: “Who are you?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed: “I am not the Christ.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they asked him: “What, then? Are you E&middot;li&acute;jah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you The Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘M<span class="smallcaps">AKE</span> the way of Jehovah straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Now those sent forth were from the Pharisees.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you yourself are not the Christ or E&middot;li&acute;jah or The Prophet?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">John answered them, saying: “I baptize in water. In the midst of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> one is standing whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">the one coming behind me, but the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">These things took place in Beth&acute;a&middot;ny across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">This is the one about whom I said, Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was that he might be made manifest to Israel.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.’</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And I have seen [it], and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: “See, the Lamb of God!”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: “What are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">He said to them: “Come, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see.” Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed [Jesus].</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">First this one found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Mes&middot;si&acute;ah” (which means, when translated, Christ).</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">He led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked upon him he said: “You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Ce&acute;phas” (which is translated Peter).</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">The next day he desired to depart for Gal&acute;i&middot;lee. So Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Be my follower.”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Now Philip was from Beth&middot;sa&acute;i&middot;da, from the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Philip found Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Naz&acute;a&middot;reth.”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">But Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el said to him: “Can anything good come out of Naz&acute;a&middot;reth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Jesus saw Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el coming toward him and said about him: “See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.”</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el said to him: “How does it come that you know me?” Jesus in answer said to him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Jesus in answer said to him: “Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe? You will see things greater than these.”</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">He further said to him: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="25">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now on the third day a marriage feast took place in Ca&acute;na of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">When the wine ran short the mother of Jesus said to him: “They have no wine.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But Jesus said to her: “What have I to do with you, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">His mother said to those ministering: “Whatever he tells <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, do.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">As it was, there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Jesus said to them: “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he said to them: “Draw some out now and take it to the director of the feast.” So they took it.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">When, now, the director of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine but did not know what its source was, although those ministering who had drawn out the water knew, the director of the feast called the bridegroom</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and said to him: “Every other man puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have reserved the fine wine until now.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jesus performed this in Ca&acute;na of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee as [the] beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">After this he and his mother and brothers and his disciples went down to Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um, but they did not stay there many days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So, after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise!”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">His disciples called to mind that it is written: “The zeal for your house will eat me up.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Therefore, in answer, the Jews said to him: “What sign have you to show us, since you are doing these things?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In answer Jesus said to them: “Break down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built in forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But he was talking about the temple of his body.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples called to mind that he used to say this; and they believed the Scripture and the saying that Jesus said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">However, when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at its festival, many people put their faith in his name, viewing his signs that he was performing.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them because of his knowing them all</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">and because he was in no need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, Nic&middot;o&middot;de&acute;mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This one came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you as a teacher have come from God; for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">In answer Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Nic&middot;o&middot;de&acute;mus said to him: “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Jesus answered: “Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Do not marvel because I told you, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> people must be born again.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone that has been born from the spirit.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">In answer Nic&middot;o&middot;de&acute;mus said to him: “How can these things come about?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In answer Jesus said to him: “Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Most truly I say to you, What we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness of, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people do not receive the witness we give.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">If I have told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> earthly things and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe, how will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believe if I tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heavenly things?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He that exercises faith in him is not to be judged. He that does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For he that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But he that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">After these things Jesus and his disciples went into Ju&middot;de&acute;an country, and there he spent some time with them and did baptizing.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But John also was baptizing in Ae&acute;non near Sa&acute;lim, because there was a great quantity of water there, and people kept coming and being baptized;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">for John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Therefore a dispute arose on the part of the disciples of John with a Jew concerning purification.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man that was with you across the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, see, this one is baptizing and all are going to him.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">In answer John said: “A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent forth in advance of that one.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">He that has the bride is the bridegroom. However, the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore this joy of mine has been made full.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">That one must go on increasing, but I must go on decreasing.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">He that comes from above is over all others. He that is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth. He that comes from heaven is over all others.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">What he has seen and heard, of this he bears witness, but no man is accepting his witness.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">He that has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that God is true.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For the one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God, for he does not give the spirit by measure.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="54">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">When, now, the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">although, indeed, Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">he left Ju&middot;de&acute;a and departed again for Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But it was necessary for him to go through Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly he came to a city of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a called Sy&acute;char near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In fact, Jacob’s fountain was there. Now Jesus, tired out from the journey, was sitting at the fountain just as he was. The hour was about the sixth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">A woman of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">(For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy foodstuffs.)</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Therefore the Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tan woman said to him: “How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink, when I am a Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tans.)</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known the free gift of God and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">She said to him: “Sir, you have not even a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, therefore, do you have this living water?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who himself together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come to this place.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In answer the woman said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You said well, ‘A husband I do not have.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For you have had five husbands, and the [man] you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">The woman said to him: “Sir, I perceive you are a prophet.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain; but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people say that in Jerusalem is the place where persons ought to worship.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, The hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people worship the Father.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> worship what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">The woman said to him: “I know that Mes&middot;si&acute;ah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one arrives, he will declare all things to us openly.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking to you am he.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now at this point his disciples arrived, and they began to wonder because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you talk with her?”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">The woman, therefore, left her water jar and went off into the city and told the men:</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Come here, see a man that told me all the things I did. This is not perhaps the Christ, is it?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">They went out of the city and began coming to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But he said to them: “I have food to eat of which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Therefore the disciples began saying to one another: “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus said to them: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>: Lift up <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">In this respect, indeed, the saying is true, One is the sower and another the reaper.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">I dispatched <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to reap what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have spent no labor on. Others have labored, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have entered into the benefit of their labor.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Now many of the Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman who said in witness: “He told me all the things I did.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Therefore when the Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Consequently many more believed on account of what he said,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">and they began to say to the woman: “We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">After the two days he left there for Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Jesus himself, however, bore witness that in his own homeland a prophet has no honor.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">When, therefore, he arrived in Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, the Gal&middot;i&middot;le&acute;ans received him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they also had gone to the festival.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Accordingly he came again to Ca&acute;na of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a certain attendant of the king whose son was sick in Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju&middot;de&acute;a into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, he went off to him and began asking him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">However, Jesus said to him: “Unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people see signs and wonders, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means believe.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">The attendant of the king said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Jesus said to him: “Go your way; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">But already while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was living.</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">Therefore he began to inquire of them the hour in which he got better in health. Accordingly they said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Therefore the father knew it was in the very hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son lives.” And he and his whole household believed.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Again this was the second sign Jesus performed when he came out of Ju&middot;de&acute;a into Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="47">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After these things there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Now in Jerusalem at the sheepgate there is a pool designated in Hebrew Beth&middot;za&acute;tha, with five colonnades.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">In these a multitude of the sick, blind, lame and those with withered members, was lying down.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">——</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But a certain man was there who had been in his sickness for thirty-eight years.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Seeing this man lying down, and being aware that he had already been [sick] a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want to become sound in health?”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The sick man answered him: “Sir, I do not have a man to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; but while I am coming another steps down ahead of me.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Jesus said to him: “Get up, pick up your cot and walk.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">With that the man immediately became sound in health, and he picked up his cot and began to walk.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs9-2">Now on that day it was a sabbath.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Therefore the Jews began to say to the cured man: “It is Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry the cot.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But he answered them: “The very one that made me sound in health said to me, ‘Pick up your cot and walk.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">They asked him: “Who is the man that told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had turned aside, there being a crowd in the place.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you have become sound in health. Do not sin anymore, in order that something worse does not happen to you.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">The man went away and told the Jews it was Jesus that made him sound in health.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So on this account the Jews went persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during Sabbath.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But he answered them: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">On this account, indeed, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore, in answer, Jesus went on to say to them: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he beholds the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may marvel.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">in order that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He that does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; just as I hear, I judge; and the judgment that I render is righteous, because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“If I alone bear witness about myself, my witness is not true.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">There is another that bears witness about me, and I know that the witness which he bears about me is true.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have dispatched men to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">However, I do not accept the witness from man, but I say these things that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be saved.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">That man was a burning and shining lamp, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for a short time were willing to rejoice greatly in his light.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, the works themselves that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father dispatched me.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Also, the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not have his word remaining in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because the very one whom he dispatched <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are searching the Scriptures, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> think that by means of them <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have everlasting life; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not want to come to me that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may have life.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">I do not accept glory from men,</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">but I well know that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not have the love of God in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">I have come in the name of my Father, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not receive me; if someone else arrived in his own name, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would receive that one.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">How can <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believe, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are accepting glory from one another and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Do not think that I will accuse <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the Father; there is one that accuses <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Moses, in whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hope.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">In fact, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believed Moses <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would believe me, for that one wrote about me.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe the writings of that one, how will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believe my sayings?”</span>

       <span id="vs1">After these things Jesus departed across the sea of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, or Ti&middot;be&acute;ri&middot;as.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But a great crowd kept following him, because they were beholding the signs he was performing upon those who were ill.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he was sitting with his disciples.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now the passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">When, therefore, Jesus raised his eyes and observed that a great crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where shall we buy loaves for these to eat?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">However, he was saying this to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Philip answered him: “Two hundred de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i worth of loaves is not enough for them, so that each one may get a little.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Here is a little boy that has five barley loaves and two small fishes. But what are these among so many?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Jesus said: “H<span class="smallcaps">AVE</span> the men recline as at meal.” Now there was a lot of grass in the place. Therefore the men reclined, about five thousand in number.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So Jesus took the loaves and, after giving thanks, he distributed them to those reclining, likewise also as much of the small fishes as they wanted.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But when they had their fill he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments that remain over, so that nothing is wasted.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore they gathered them together, and they filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Hence when the men saw the signs he performed, they began to say: “This is for a certainty the prophet that was to come into the world.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Therefore Jesus, knowing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and, boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um. Well, by now it had grown dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Also, the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they beheld Jesus walking upon the sea and getting near the boat; and they became fearful.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But he said to them: “It is I; have no fear!”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Therefore they were willing to take him into the boat, and directly the boat was at the land to which they were trying to go.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">The next day the crowd that was standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there except a little one, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples but that only his disciples had left;</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">but boats from Ti&middot;be&acute;ri&middot;as arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore when the crowd saw that neither Jesus was there nor his disciples, they boarded their little boats and came to Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um to look for Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So when they found him across the sea they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Jesus answered them and said: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are looking for me, not because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> saw signs, but because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ate from the loaves and were satisfied.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting, which the Son of man will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; for upon this one the Father, even God, has put his seal [of approval].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore they said to him: “What shall we do to work the works of God?”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> exercise faith in him whom that One sent forth.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you performing as a sign, in order for us to see [it] and believe you? What work are you doing?</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Hence Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Moses did not give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the bread from heaven, but my Father does give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the true bread from heaven.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. He that comes to me will not get hungry at all, and he that exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">But I have said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have even seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one that comes to me I will by no means drive away;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Therefore the Jews began to murmur at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven”;</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">and they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it that now he says, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">In answer Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him; and I will resurrect him in the last day.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God; this one has seen the Father.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He that believes has everlasting life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">“I am the bread of life.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet died.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">Therefore the Jews began contending with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Accordingly Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Unless <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have no life in yourselves.</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I shall resurrect him at the last day;</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">for my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Just as the living Father sent me forth and I live because of the Father, he also that feeds on me, even that one will live because of me.</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers ate and yet died. He that feeds on this bread will live forever.”</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">These things he said as he was teaching in public assembly at Ca&middot;per&acute;na&middot;um.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: “Does this stumble <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">What, therefore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are spirit and are life.</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">But there are some of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that do not believe.” For from [the] beginning Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.</span> <a name="bk65" class="vsAnchor">65</a>
       <span id="vs65">So he went on to say: “This is why I have said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk66" class="vsAnchor">66</a>
       <span id="vs66">Owing to this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.</span> <a name="bk67" class="vsAnchor">67</a>
       <span id="vs67">Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> do not want to go also, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?”</span> <a name="bk68" class="vsAnchor">68</a>
       <span id="vs68">Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life;</span> <a name="bk69" class="vsAnchor">69</a>
       <span id="vs69">and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”</span> <a name="bk70" class="vsAnchor">70</a>
       <span id="vs70">Jesus answered them: “I chose <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> twelve, did I not? Yet one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is a slanderer.”</span> <a name="bk71" class="vsAnchor">71</a>
       <span id="vs71">He was, in fact, speaking of Judas [the son] of Simon Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot; for this one was going to betray him, although one of the twelve.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now after these things Jesus continued walking about in Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, for he did not want to walk about in Ju&middot;de&acute;a, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">However, the festival of the Jews, the festival of tabernacles, was near.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Therefore his brothers said to him: “Pass on over from here and go into Ju&middot;de&acute;a, in order that your disciples also may behold the works you do.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For nobody does anything in secret while himself seeking to be known publicly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Therefore Jesus said to them: “My due time is not yet present, but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> due time is always at hand.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The world has no reason to hate <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but it hates me, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are wicked.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> go up to the festival; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my due time has not yet fully come.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So after he told them these things, he remained in Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up himself, not openly but as in secret.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Therefore the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying: “Where is that [man]?”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds. Some would say: “He is a good man.” Others would say: “He is not, but he misleads the crowd.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">No one, of course, would speak about him publicly because of the fear of the Jews.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">When by now the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Therefore the Jews fell to wondering, saying: “How does this man have a knowledge of letters, when he has not studied at the schools?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">He that speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Moses gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the Law, did he not? But not one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> obeys the Law. Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> seeking to kill me?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">The crowd answered: “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In answer Jesus said to them: “One deed I performed, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are all wondering.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For this reason Moses has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but that it is from the forefathers—and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> circumcise a man on a sabbath.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken, are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> violently angry at me because I made a man completely sound in health on a sabbath?</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Stop judging from the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Therefore some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say: “This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And yet, see! he is speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. The rulers have not come to know for a certainty that this is the Christ, have they?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">On the contrary, we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one is to know where he is from.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple and said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> both know me and know where I am from. Also, I have not come of my own initiative, but he that sent me is real, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">I know him, because I am a representative from him, and that One sent me forth.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Hence they began seeking to get hold of him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Still, many of the crowd put faith in him; and they commenced saying: “When the Christ arrives, he will not perform more signs than this man has performed, will he?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees dispatched officers to get hold of him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Therefore Jesus said: “I continue a little while longer with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before I go to him that sent me.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will look for me, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not find me, and where I am <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot come.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where does this [man] intend going, so that we shall not find him? He does not intend to go to the [Jews] dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he?</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">What does this saying mean that he said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will look for me, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not find me, and where I am <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot come’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Now on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus was standing up and he cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">He that puts faith in me, just as the Scripture has said, ‘Out from his inmost part streams of living water will flow.’”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">However, he said this concerning the spirit which those who put faith in him were about to receive; for as yet there was no spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words began saying: “This is for a certainty The Prophet.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Others were saying: “This is the Christ.” But some were saying: “The Christ is not actually coming out of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, is he?</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Has not the Scripture said that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David, and from Beth&acute;le&middot;hem the village where David used to be?”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Therefore a division over him developed among the crowd.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Some of them, though, were wanting to get hold of him, but no one did lay [his] hands upon him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Therefore the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and the latter said to them: “Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not bring him in?”</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">The officers replied: “Never has [another] man spoken like this.”</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">In turn the Pharisees answered: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> have not been misled also, have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he?</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">But this crowd that does not know the Law are accursed people.”</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Nic&middot;o&middot;de&acute;mus, who had come to him previously, and who was one of them, said to them:</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">“Our law does not judge a man unless first it has heard from him and come to know what he is doing, does it?”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">In answer they said to him: “You are not also out of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee.”*</span>

       <span class="smallcaps">But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">2</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">At daybreak, however, he again presented himself at the temple, and all the people began coming to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">3</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught at adultery, and, after standing her in their midst,</span> <span class="vsAnchor">4</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">they said to him: “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">5</span>

       <span class="smallcaps">Of course, they were saying this to put him to the test, in order to have something with which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and began to write with his finger in the ground.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">7</span>

       <span class="smallcaps">And bending over again he kept on writing in the ground.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">9</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">But those who heard this began going out, one by one, starting with the older men, and he was left alone, and the woman that was in their midst.</span> <span class="vsAnchor">10</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">Straightening up, Jesus said to her: “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”</span> <span class="vsAnchor">11</span>
       <span class="smallcaps">She said: “No one, sir.” Jesus said: “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on practice sin no more.”</span>

       <span id="vs9"><span class="smallcaps">But those who heard this began going out, one by one, starting with the older men, and he was left alone, and the woman that was in their midst.</span></span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

       <span id="vs11"><span class="smallcaps">She said: “No one, sir.” Jesus said: “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on practice sin no more.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Therefore Jesus spoke again to them, saying: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Hence the Pharisees said to him: “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">In answer Jesus said to them: “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know where I came from and where I am going.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> judge according to the flesh; I do not judge any man at all.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And yet if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Also, in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own Law it is written, ‘The witness of two men is true.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I am one that bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore they went on to say to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> know neither me nor my Father. If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did know me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would know my Father also.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">These sayings he spoke in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one laid hold of him, because his hour had not yet come.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Hence he said to them again: “I am going away, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will look for me, and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will die in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sin. Where I am going <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot come.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Therefore the Jews began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot come.’”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So he went on to say to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are from this world; I am not from this world.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore I said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will die in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sins. For if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe that I am [he], <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will die in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sins.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Therefore they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “Why am I even speaking to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at all?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">I have many things to speak concerning <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to pass judgment upon. As a matter of fact, he that sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore Jesus said: “When once <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have lifted up the Son of man, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will know that I am [he], and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And he that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">As he was speaking these things, many put faith in him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And so Jesus went on to say to the Jews that had believed him: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> remain in my word, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are really my disciples,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will know the truth, and the truth will set <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> free.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">They replied to him: “We are Abraham’s offspring and never have we been slaves to anybody. How is it you say, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will become free’?”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Every doer of sin is a slave of sin.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Therefore if the Son sets <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> free, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be actually free.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">I know that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are Abraham’s offspring; but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">What things I have seen with my Father I speak; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, therefore, do the things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have heard from [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] father.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">In answer they said to him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">But now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are seeking to kill me, a man that has told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> do the works of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father.” They said to him: “We were not born from fornication; we have one Father, God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Jesus said to them: “If God were <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would love me, for from God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know what I am speaking? Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot listen to my word.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father the Devil, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wish to do the desires of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of [the lie].</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Because I, on the other hand, tell the truth, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe me.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Who of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe me?</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">He that is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not listen, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not from God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">In answer the Jews said to him: “Do we not rightly say, You are a Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;tan and have a demon?”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> dishonor me.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One that is seeking and judging.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.”</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">The Jews said to him: “Now we do know you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets; but you say, ‘If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.’</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? Also, the prophets died. Who do you claim to be?”</span> <a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Jesus answered: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, he who <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God;</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not known him. But I know him. And if I said I do not know him I should be like <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">Abraham <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> father rejoiced greatly in the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">Therefore the Jews said to him: “You are not yet fifty years old, and still you have seen Abraham?”</span> <a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Before Abraham came into existence, I have been.”</span> <a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">Therefore they picked up stones to hurl [them] at him; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple.</span>

<p class="title">John 9:1-41</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="21">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="41">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now as he was passing along he saw a man blind from birth.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And his disciples asked him: “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Jesus answered: “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it was in order that the works of God might be made manifest in his case.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no man can work.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">As long as I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">After he said these things, he spit on the ground and made a clay with the saliva, and put his clay upon the [man’s] eyes</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and said to him: “Go wash in the pool of Si&middot;lo&acute;am” (which is translated ‘Sent forth’). And so he went off and washed, and came back seeing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Therefore the neighbors and those who formerly used to see he was a beggar began to say: “This is the man that used to sit and beg, is it not?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Some would say: “This is he.” Others would say: “Not at all, but he is like him.” The man would say: “I am [he].”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Consequently they began to say to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He answered: “The man called Jesus made a clay and smeared [it] on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Si&middot;lo&acute;am and wash.’ I therefore went and washed and gained sight.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At this they said to him: “Where is that [man]?” He said: “I do not know.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">They led the once-blind man himself to the Pharisees.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Incidentally it was Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">This time, therefore, the Pharisees also took up asking him how he gained sight. He said to them: “He put a clay upon my eyes, and I washed and have sight.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Therefore some of the Pharisees began to say: “This is not a man from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.” Others began to say: “How can a man that is a sinner perform signs of that sort?” So there was a division among them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Hence they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, seeing that he opened your eyes?” The [man] said: “He is a prophet.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">However, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had gained sight, until they called the parents of the man that gained sight.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And they asked them: “Is this <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> son who <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say was born blind? How, then, is it he sees at present?”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then in answer his parents said: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But how it is he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. A<span class="smallcaps">SK</span> him. He is of age. He must speak for himself.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews, for the Jews had already come to an agreement that, if anyone confessed him as Christ, he should get expelled from the synagogue.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">This is why his parents said: “He is of age. Q<span class="smallcaps">UESTION</span> him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore a second time they called the man that had been blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">In turn he answered: “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, I see at present.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He answered them: “I told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> already, and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not listen. Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> want to hear it again? Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> do not want to become his disciples also, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">At this they reviled him and said: “You are a disciple of that [man], but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this [man], we do not know where he is from.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In answer the man said to them: “This certainly is a marvel, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to this one.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">If this [man] were not from God, he could do nothing at all.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">In answer they said to him: “You were altogether born in sins, and yet are you teaching us?” And they threw him out!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and, on finding him, he said: “Are you putting faith in the Son of man?”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">The [man] answered: “And who is he, sir, that I may put faith in him?”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Jesus said to him: “You have seen him and, besides, he that is speaking with you is that one.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Then he said: “I do put faith [in him], Lord.” And he did obeisance to him.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And Jesus said: “For [this] judgment I came into this world: that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “We are not blind also, are we?”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Jesus said to them: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were blind, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would have no sin. But now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘We see.’ Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> sin remains.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">“Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He that does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs up some other place, that one is a thief and a plunderer.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But he that enters through the door is shepherd of the sheep.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When he has got all his own out, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">A stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Jesus spoke this comparison to them; but they did not know what the things meant that he was speaking to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore Jesus said again: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">All those that have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers; but the sheep have not listened to them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and find pasturage.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The hired man, who is no shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong as his own, beholds the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them—</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my soul, in order that I may receive it again.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">No man has taken it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative. I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. The commandment on this I received from my Father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Again a division resulted among the Jews because of these words.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Many of them were saying: “He has a demon and is mad. Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> listen to him?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Others would say: “These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people’s eyes, can it?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At that time the festival of dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore the Jews encircled him and began to say to him: “How long are you to keep our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us outspokenly.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Jesus answered them: “I told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe. The works that I am doing in the name of my Father, these bear witness about me.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are none of my sheep.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">I and the Father are one.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Once more the Jews lifted up stones to stone him.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Jesus replied to them: “I displayed to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> stoning me?”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy, even because you, although being a man, make yourself a god.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are gods”’?</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">If he called ‘gods’ those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, I am God’s Son?</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">But if I am doing them, even though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not believe me, believe the works, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Therefore they tried again to seize him; but he got out of their reach.</span>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">So he went off again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And many people came to him, and they began saying: “John, indeed, did not perform a single sign, but as many things as John said about this man were all true.”</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">And many put faith in him there.</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="21">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="57">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now there was a certain man sick, Laz&acute;a&middot;rus of Beth&acute;a&middot;ny, of the village of Mary and of Martha her sister.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">It was, in fact, the Mary that greased the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Laz&acute;a&middot;rus was sick.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Therefore his sisters dispatched word to him, saying: “Lord, see! the one for whom you have affection is sick.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But when Jesus heard it he said: “This sickness is not with death as its object, but is for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Laz&acute;a&middot;rus.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">However, when he heard that he was sick, then he actually remained two days in the place where he was.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then after this he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Ju&middot;de&acute;a again.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, just lately the Ju&middot;de&acute;ans were seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Jesus answered: “There are twelve hours of daylight, are there not? If anyone walks in daylight he does not bump against anything, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But if anyone walks in the night, he bumps against something, because the light is not in him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He said these things, and after this he said to them: “Laz&acute;a&middot;rus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there to awaken him from sleep.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has gone to rest, he will get well.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Jesus had spoken, however, about his death. But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: “Laz&acute;a&middot;rus has died,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and I rejoice on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> account that I was not there, in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to believe. But let us go to him.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Therefore Thomas, who was called The Twin, said to his fellow disciples: “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Consequently when Jesus arrived, he found he had already been four days in the memorial tomb.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now Beth&acute;a&middot;ny was near Jerusalem at a distance of about two miles.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Accordingly many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him; but Mary kept sitting at home.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life;</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">She said to him: “Yes, Lord; I have believed that you are the Christ the Son of God, the One coming into the world.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And when she had said this, she went off and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is present and is calling you.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The latter, when she heard this, got up quickly and was on her way to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Jesus had not yet, in fact, come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Therefore the Jews that were with her in the house and that were consoling her, on seeing Mary rise quickly and go out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the memorial tomb to weep there.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And so Mary, when she arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him, fell at his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping and the Jews that came with her weeping, groaned in the spirit and became troubled;</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">and he said: “Where have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> laid him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Jesus gave way to tears.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Therefore the Jews began to say: “See, what affection he used to have for him!”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But some of them said: “Was not this [man] that opened the eyes of the blind man able to prevent this one from dying?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Hence Jesus, after groaning again within himself, came to the memorial tomb. It was, in fact, a cave, and a stone was lying against it.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Jesus said: “T<span class="smallcaps">AKE</span> the stone away.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: “Lord, by now he must smell, for it is four days.”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Jesus said to her: “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Therefore they took the stone away. Now Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">True, I knew that you always hear me; but on account of the crowd standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that you sent me forth.”</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: “Laz&acute;a&middot;rus, come on out!”</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">The [man] that had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his countenance was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them: “Loose him and let him go.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Therefore many of the Jews that had come to Mary and that beheld what he did put faith in him;</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Consequently the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the San&acute;he&middot;drin together and began to say: “What are we to do, because this man performs many signs?</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">If we let him alone this way, they will all put faith in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">But a certain one of them, Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas, who was high priest that year, said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> do not know anything at all,</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not reason out that it is to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people and not for the whole nation to be destroyed.”</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">This, though, he did not say of his own originality; but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was destined to die for the nation,</span> <a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">and not for the nation only, but in order that the children of God who are scattered about he might also gather together in one.</span> <a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">Therefore from that day on they took counsel to kill him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Hence Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews, but he departed from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called E&acute;phra&middot;im, and there he remained with the disciples.</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many people went up out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover in order to cleanse themselves ceremonially.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">Therefore they went looking for Jesus and they would say to one another as they stood around in the temple: “What is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> opinion? That he will not come to the festival at all?”</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">As it was, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where he was, he should disclose [it], in order that they might seize him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Accordingly Jesus, six days before the passover, arrived at Beth&acute;a&middot;ny, where Laz&acute;a&middot;rus was whom Jesus had raised up from the dead.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Therefore they spread an evening meal for him there, and Martha was ministering, but Laz&acute;a&middot;rus was one of those reclining at the table with him.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Mary, therefore, took a pound of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very costly, and she greased the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair. The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But Judas Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Why was it this perfumed oil was not sold for three hundred de&middot;nar&acute;i&middot;i and given to the poor people?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">He said this, though, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to carry off the monies put in it.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore Jesus said: “Let her alone, that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have the poor always with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but me <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not have always.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Therefore a great crowd of the Jews got to know he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but also to see Laz&acute;a&middot;rus, whom he raised up from the dead.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">The chief priests now took counsel to kill Laz&acute;a&middot;rus also,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">because on account of him many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus.</span>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival, on hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they began to shout: “Save, we pray you! Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name, even the king of Israel!”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But when Jesus had found a young ass, he sat on it, just as it is written:</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Have no fear, daughter of Zion. Look! Your king is coming, seated upon an ass’s colt.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">These things his disciples took no note of at first, but when Jesus became glorified, then they called to mind that these things were written respecting him and that they did these things to him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Accordingly the crowd that was with him when he called Laz&acute;a&middot;rus out of the memorial tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">On this account the crowd, because they heard he had performed this sign, also met him.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> observe <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are getting absolutely nowhere. See! The world has gone after him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Now there were some Greeks among those that came up to worship at the festival.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">These, therefore, approached Philip who was from Beth&middot;sa&acute;i&middot;da of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee, and they began to request him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains just one [grain]; but if it dies, it then bears much fruit.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He that is fond of his soul destroys it, but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">If anyone would minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am there my minister will be also. If anyone would minister to me, the Father will honor him.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me out of this hour. Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Father, glorify your name.” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified [it] and will glorify [it] again.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Hence the crowd that stood about and heard it began to say that it had thundered. Others began to say: “An angel has spoken to him.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In answer Jesus said: “This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sakes.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And yet I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw men of all sorts to me.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">This he was really saying to signify what sort of death he was about to die.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Therefore the crowd answered him: “We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how is it you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a little while longer. Walk while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have the light, so that darkness does not overpower <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and he that walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">While <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have the light, exercise faith in the light, in order to become sons of light.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs36-2">Jesus spoke these things and went off and hid from them.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">But although he had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said: “Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard by us? And as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed?”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said:</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“He has blinded their eyes and he has made their hearts hard, that they should not see with their eyes and get the thought with their hearts and turn around and I should heal them.”</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">All the same, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess [him], in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">for they loved the glory of men more than even the glory of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">However, Jesus cried out and said: “He that puts faith in me puts faith, not in me [only], but in him [also] that sent me;</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">and he that beholds me beholds [also] him that sent me.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">He that disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him. The word that I have spoken is what will judge him in the last day;</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">because I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak.</span> <a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Also, I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore the things I speak, just as the Father has told me [them], so I speak [them].”</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="21">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="38">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now, because he knew before the festival of the passover that his hour had come for him to move out of this world to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the end.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So, while the evening meal was going on, the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot, the son of Simon, to betray him,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">he, knowing that the Father had given all things into [his] hands and that he came forth from God and was going to God,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And, taking a towel, he girded himself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel with which he was girded.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And so he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">In answer Jesus said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand at present, but you will understand after these things.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Peter said to him: “You will certainly never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him: “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Jesus said to him: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are clean, but not all.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He knew, indeed, the man betraying him. This is why he said: “Not all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are clean.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on and laid himself down at the table again, he said to them: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know what I have done to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> address me, ‘Teacher,’ and, ‘Lord,’ and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> speak rightly, for I am such.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore, if I, although Lord and Teacher, washed <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also ought to wash the feet of one another.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For I set the pattern for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that, just as I did to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should do also.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, A slave is not greater than his master, nor is one that is sent forth greater than the one that sent him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know these things, happy <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I am not talking about all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; I know the ones I have chosen. But it is in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">From this moment on I am telling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before it occurs, in order that when it does occur <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may believe that I am [he].</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, He that receives anyone I send receives me [also]. In turn he that receives me, receives [also] him that sent me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he bore witness and said: “Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, One of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will betray me.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">The disciples began to look at one another, being at a loss as to which one he was saying [it] about.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">There was reclining in front of Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, and Jesus loved him.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him: “Tell who it is about whom he is saying [it].”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So the latter leaned back upon the breast of Jesus and said to him: “Lord, who is it?”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore Jesus answered: “It is that one to whom I shall give the morsel that I dip.” And so, having dipped the morsel, he took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Is&middot;car&acute;i&middot;ot.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And after the morsel then Satan entered into the latter. Jesus, therefore, said to him: “What you are doing get done more quickly.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">However, none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose he said this to him.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Some, in fact, were imagining, since Judas was holding the money box, that Jesus was telling him: “Buy what things we need for the festival,” or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Therefore, after he received the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Hence when he had gone out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in connection with him.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And God will himself glorify him, and he will glorify him immediately.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Little children, I am with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a little longer. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot come,’ I say also to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at present.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">I am giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a new commandment, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> love one another; just as I have loved <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also love one another.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">By this all will know that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are my disciples, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have love among yourselves.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered: “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterwards.”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Peter said to him: “Lord, why is it I cannot follow you at present? I will surrender my soul in your behalf.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Jesus answered: “Will you surrender your soul in my behalf? Most truly I say to you, A cock will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">Men will expel <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone that kills <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Nevertheless, I have spoken these things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that, when the hour for them arrives, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may remember I told them to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">“These things, however, I did not tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at first, because I was with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But now I am going to him that sent me, and yet not one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But because I have spoken these things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> grief has filled <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Nevertheless, I am telling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the truth, It is for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> benefit I am going away.

       <span id="vs8">And when that one arrives he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">in the first place, concerning sin, because they are not exercising faith in me;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">then concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will behold me no longer;</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">then concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“I have many things yet to say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not able to bear them at present.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">However, when that one arrives, the spirit of the truth, he will guide <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> into all the truth, for he will not speak of his own impulse, but what things he hears he will speak, and he will declare to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the things coming.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">That one will glorify me, because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">All the things that the Father has are mine. That is why I said he receives from what is mine and declares [it] to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will behold me no longer, and, again, in a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Therefore some of his disciples said to one another: “What does this mean that he says to us, ‘In a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not behold me, and, again, in a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see me,’ and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Hence they were saying: “What does this mean that he says, ‘a little while’? We do not know what he is talking about.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Jesus knew they were wanting to question him, so he said to them: “Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inquiring among yourselves over this, because I said, In a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not behold me, and, again, in a little while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will see me?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be grieved, but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> grief will be turned into joy.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">A woman, when she is giving birth, has grief, because her hour has arrived; but when she has brought forth the young child, she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> also, therefore, are now, indeed, having grief; but I shall see <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> again and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts will rejoice, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> joy no one will take from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And in that day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will ask me no question at all. Most truly I say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ask the Father for anything he will give it to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in my name.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Until this present time <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will receive, that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> joy may be made full.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“I have spoken these things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in comparisons. The hour is coming when I will speak to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> no more in comparisons, but I will report to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with plainness concerning the Father.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">In that day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will ask in my name, and I do not say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that I shall make request of the Father concerning <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For the Father himself has affection for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have had affection for me and have believed that I came out as the Father’s representative.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">I came out from the Father and have come into the world. Further, I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">His disciples said: “See! Now you are speaking with plainness, and are uttering no comparison.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you. By this we believe that you came out from God.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Jesus answered them: “Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believe at present?</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be scattered each one to his own house and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">I have said these things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that by means of me <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may have peace. In the world <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are having tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.”</span>

       <span id="vs7">Therefore he asked them again: “Whom are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> looking for?” They said: “Jesus the Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute;.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Jesus answered: “I told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> I am [he]. If, therefore, it is I <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are looking for, let these go”;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">in order that the word might be fulfilled which he said: “Of those whom you have given me I have not lost a single one.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Simon Peter, as he had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut his right ear off. The name of the slave was Malchus.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jesus, however, said to Peter: “Put the sword into [its] sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not by all means drink it?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the soldier band and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and they led him first to An&acute;nas; for he was father-in-law to Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas, who was high priest that year.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas was, in fact, the one that counseled the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now Simon Peter as well as another disciple was following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">but Peter was standing outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">The servant girl, the doorkeeper, then said to Peter: “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said: “I am not.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now the slaves and the officers were standing about, as they had built a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And so the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">After he said these things, one of the officers that was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said: “Is that the way you answer the chief priest?”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Jesus answered him: “If I spoke wrongly, bear witness concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit me?”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then An&acute;nas sent him away bound to Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas the high priest.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said: “I am not.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said: “I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">However, Peter denied it again; and immediately a cock crowed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then they led Jesus from Ca&acute;ia&middot;phas to the governor’s palace. It was now early in the day. But they themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace, that they might not get defiled but might eat the passover.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Therefore Pilate came outside to them and said: “What accusation do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> bring against this man?”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In answer they said to him: “If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Hence Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and judge him according to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> law.” The Jews said to him: “It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.”</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">This, in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said to signify what sort of death he was destined to die.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Jesus answered: “Is it of your own originality that you say this, or did others tell you about me?”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Pilate answered: “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you up to me. What did you do?”</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Jesus answered: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Therefore Pilate said to him: “Well, then, are you a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone that is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs38-2">And after saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I find no fault in him.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Moreover, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have a custom that I should release a man to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at the passover. Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, therefore, wish me to release to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the king of the Jews?”</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Then they shouted again, saying: “Not this man, but Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas!” Now Bar&middot;ab&acute;bas was a robber.</span>

<p class="title">John 19:1-42</p>
<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="42">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At that time, therefore, Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him with a purple outer garment;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and they began coming up to him and saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!” Also, they would give him slaps in the face.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Pilate went outside again and said to them: “See! I bring him outside to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know I find no fault in him.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple outer garment. And he said to them: “Look! The man!”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">However, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying: “Impale [him]! Impale [him]!” Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and impale him, for I do not find any fault in him.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself God’s son.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When, therefore, Pilate heard this saying, he became more fearful;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and he entered into the governor’s palace again and said to Jesus: “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Hence Pilate said to him: “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know I have authority to release you and I have authority to impale you?”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jesus answered him: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man that handed me over to you has greater sin.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this reason Pilate kept on seeking how to release him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you release this [man], you are not a friend of Caesar. Every man making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Therefore Pilate, after hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called The Stone Pavement, but, in Hebrew, <i>Gab&acute;ba&middot;tha</i>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now it was preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: “See! Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> king!”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, they shouted: “Take [him] away! Take [him] away! Impale him!” Pilate said to them: “Shall I impale <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> king?” The chief priests answered: “We have no king but Caesar.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs16-2">Then they took charge of Jesus.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And, bearing the torture stake for himself, he went out to the so-called Skull Place, which is called <i>Gol&acute;go&middot;tha</i> in Hebrew;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and there they impaled him, and two other [men] with him, one on this side and one on that, but Jesus in the middle.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the torture stake. It was written: “Jesus the Naz&middot;a&middot;rene&acute; the King of the Jews.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">However, the chief priests of the Jews began to say to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now when the soldiers had impaled Jesus, they took his outer garments and made four parts, for each soldier a part, and the inner garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from the top throughout its length.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Therefore they said to one another: “Let us not tear it, but let us determine by lots over it whose it will be.” This was that the scripture might be fulfilled: “They apportioned my outer garments among themselves, and upon my apparel they cast lots.” And so the soldiers really did these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">By the torture stake of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and the sister of his mother; Mary the wife of Clo&acute;pas, and Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Therefore Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Next he said to the disciple: “See! Your mother!” And from that hour on the disciple took her to his own home.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">After this, when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished, in order that the scripture might be accomplished he said: “I am thirsty.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">A vessel was sitting there full of sour wine. Therefore they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a hyssop [stalk] and brought it to his mouth.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">When, now, he had received the sour wine, Jesus said: “It has been accomplished!” and, bowing his head, he delivered up [his] spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then the Jews, since it was Preparation, in order that the bodies might not remain upon the torture stakes on the Sabbath, (for the day of that Sabbath was a great one,) requested Pilate to have their legs broken and the [bodies] taken away.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first [man] and those of the other [man] that had been impaled with him.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And he that has seen [it] has borne witness, and his witness is true, and that man knows he tells true things, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also may believe.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">In fact, these things took place in order for the scripture to be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be crushed.”</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And, again, a different scripture says: “They will look to the One whom they pierced.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Now after these things Joseph from Ar&middot;i&middot;ma&middot;the&acute;a, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one out of [his] fear of the Jews, requested Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body away.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Nic&middot;o&middot;de&acute;mus also, the man that came to him in the night the first time, came bringing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [of it].</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">So they took the body of Jesus and bound it up with bandages with the spices, just the way the Jews have the custom of preparing for burial.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Incidentally, at the place where he was impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a new memorial tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">There, then, on account of the preparation of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the memorial tomb was nearby.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="31">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">On the first day of the week Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene came to the memorial tomb early, while there was still darkness, and she beheld the stone already taken away from the memorial tomb.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, for whom Jesus had affection, and she said to them: “They have taken away the Lord out of the memorial tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Peter and the other disciple went out and started for the memorial tomb.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Yes, the two together began to run; but the other disciple ran ahead of Peter with greater speed and reached the memorial tomb first.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And, stooping forward, he beheld the bandages lying, yet he did not go in.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he entered into the memorial tomb. And he viewed the bandages lying,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">also the cloth that had been upon his head not lying with the bandages but separately rolled up in one place.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that time, therefore, the other disciple who had reached the memorial tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For they did not yet discern the scripture that he must rise from the dead.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And so the disciples went back to their homes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Mary, however, kept standing outside near the memorial tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she stooped forward to look into the memorial tomb</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and she viewed two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And they said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them: “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have laid him.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">After saying these things, she turned back and viewed Jesus standing, but she did not discern it was Jesus.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Jesus said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She, imagining it was the gardener, said to him: “Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Upon turning around, she said to him, in Hebrew: <i>“Rab&middot;bo&acute;ni!”</i> (which means “Teacher!”)</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Jesus said to her: “Stop clinging to me. For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But be on your way to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> Father and to my God and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Mary Mag&acute;da&middot;lene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!” and that he said these things to her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore, when it was late on that day, the first of the week, and, although the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them: “May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have peace.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And after he said this he showed them both his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jesus, therefore, said to them again: “May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have peace. Just as the Father has sent me forth, I also am sending <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And after he said this he blew upon them and said to them: “Receive holy spirit.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forgive the sins of any persons, they stand forgiven to them; if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> retain those of any persons, they stand retained.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called The Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Consequently the other disciples would say to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst and said: “May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have peace.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Next he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop being unbelieving but become believing.”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">In answer Thomas said to him: “My Lord and my God!”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Jesus said to him: “Because you have seen me have you believed? Happy are those who do not see and yet believe.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">To be sure, Jesus performed many other signs also before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">But these have been written down that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may have life by means of his name.</span>

<p class="title">John 21:1-25</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="21">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="25">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Ti&middot;be&acute;ri&middot;as; but he made the manifestation in this way.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">There were in company Simon Peter and Thomas, who was called The Twin, and Na&middot;than&acute;a&middot;el from Ca&acute;na of Gal&acute;i&middot;lee and the sons of Zeb&acute;e&middot;dee and two others of his disciples.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Simon Peter said to them: “I am going fishing.” They said to him: “We also are coming with you.” Out they went and got aboard the boat, but during that night they caught nothing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">However, just as it was getting to be morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not, of course, discern that it was Jesus.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Jesus said to them: “Young children, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not have anything to eat, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?” They answered “No!” to him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">He said to them: “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will find [some].” Then they cast it, but they were no longer able to draw it in because of the multitude of the fishes.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus used to love said to Peter: “It is the Lord!” Hence Simon Peter, upon hearing that it was the Lord, girded about himself his top garment, for he was naked, and plunged into the sea.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not a long way from land, only about three hundred feet away, dragging the net of fishes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">However, when they disembarked onto land they beheld lying there a charcoal fire and fish lying upon it and bread.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Jesus said to them: “Bring some of the fish <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> just now caught.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Simon Peter, therefore, went on board and drew the net to land full of big fishes, one hundred and fifty-three of them. But although there were so many the net did not burst.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Jesus said to them: “Come, take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> breakfast.” Not one of the disciples had the courage to inquire of him: “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after his being raised up from the dead.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When, now, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Feed my lambs.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Shepherd my little sheep.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">He said to him the third time: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” Peter became grieved that he said to him the third time: “Do you have affection for me?” So he said to him: “Lord, you know all things; you are aware that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him: “Feed my little sheep.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Most truly I say to you, When you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another [man] will gird you and bear you where you do not wish.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">This he said to signify by what sort of death he would glorify God. So, when he had said this, he said to him: “Continue following me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Upon turning about Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus used to love following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back upon his breast and said: “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Accordingly, when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this [man do]?”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jesus said to him: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In consequence, this saying went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">This is the disciple that bears witness about these things and that wrote these things, and we know that the witness he gives is true.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.</span>
