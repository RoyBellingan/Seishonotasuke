<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the son of David continued to get strength in his kingship, and Jehovah his God was with him and kept making him surpassingly great.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to say the word to all Israel, to the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and to the judges and to all the chieftains of all Israel, the heads of the paternal houses.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at Gib&acute;e&middot;on; for there was where the tent of meeting of the [true] God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness, happened to be.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">However, the ark of the [true] God David had brought up from Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the copper altar that Bez&acute;al&middot;el the son of U&acute;ri the son of Hur had made had been put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and the congregation applied as usual to it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Sol&acute;o&middot;mon now made offerings there before Jehovah upon the copper altar that belonged to the tent of meeting, and he proceeded to offer upon it a thousand burnt offerings.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">During that night God appeared to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and then said to him: “Ask! What shall I give you?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">At that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon said to God: “You are the One that exercised great loving-kindness toward David my father and that have made me king in place of him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now, O Jehovah God, let your promise with David my father prove faithful, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust particles of the earth.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out before this people and that I may come in, for who could judge this great people of yours?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then God said to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon: “For the reason that this has proved to be close to your heart and you have not asked for wealth, riches and honor or for the soul of those hating you, neither is it even many days that you have asked for, but you ask for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge my people over whom I have made you king,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">the wisdom and the knowledge are being given you; also wealth and riches and honor I shall give you such as no kings that were prior to you happened to have, and such as no one after you will come to have.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So Sol&acute;o&middot;mon came [from] the high place that was at Gib&acute;e&middot;on, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem and continued to reign over Israel.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept gathering chariots and steeds so that he came to have a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand steeds, and he kept them stationed in chariot cities and close by the king at Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the king came to make the silver and the gold in Jerusalem like the stones; and cedarwood he made like the sycamore trees that are in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah for great quantity.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And there was the export of the horses that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had from Egypt, and the company of the king’s merchants would themselves take the horse drove for a price.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they customarily brought up and exported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silver pieces and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and that was the way it was for all the kings of the Hit&acute;tites and the kings of Syria. It was by means of them that they did the exporting.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now as soon as Sol&acute;o&middot;mon finished praying, the fire itself came down from the heavens and proceeded to consume the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and Jehovah’s glory itself filled the house.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the priests were unable to enter into the house of Jehovah because Jehovah’s glory had filled the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And all the sons of Israel were spectators when the fire came down and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house, and they immediately bowed low with their faces to the earth upon the pavement and prostrated themselves and thanked Jehovah, “for he is good, for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the king and all the people were offering sacrifice before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went on offering the sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the people inaugurated the house of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the priests were standing at their posts of duty, and the Levites with the instruments of song to Jehovah that David the king had made to thank Jehovah, “for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite,” when David would render praise by their hand; and the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets in front of them, while all the Israelites were standing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Sol&acute;o&middot;mon sanctified the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Jehovah, because there he rendered up the burnt offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, for the copper altar that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had made was itself not able to contain the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon proceeded to hold the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation from the entering in of Ha&acute;math down to the torrent valley of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, because the inauguration of the altar they had held for seven days and the festival for seven days.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and feeling good at heart over the goodness that Jehovah had performed toward David and toward Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and toward Israel his people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Thus Sol&acute;o&middot;mon finished the house of Jehovah and the house of the king; and in everything that had come into Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s heart to do regarding the house of Jehovah and his own house he proved successful.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Jehovah now appeared to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon during the night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">When I shut up the heavens that no rain may occur and when I command the grasshoppers to eat up the land and if I send a pestilence among my people,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and my people upon whom my name has been called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn back from their bad ways, then I myself shall hear from the heavens and forgive their sin, and I shall heal their land.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now my own eyes will prove to be opened and my ears attentive to prayer at this place.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And now I do choose and sanctify this house that my name may prove to be there to time indefinite, and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And if you yourself will walk before me, just as David your father walked, even by doing according to all that I have commanded you, and you will keep my regulations and my judicial decisions,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">I will also establish the throne of your kingship, just as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There will not a man of yours be cut off from ruling over Israel.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves turn back and actually leave my statutes and my commandments that I have put before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> actually go and serve other gods and bow down to them,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">I will also uproot them from off my ground that I have given them; and this house that I have sanctified for my name, I shall throw away from before my face, and I shall make it a proverbial saying and a taunt among all the peoples.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">As for this house that had become heaps of ruins, everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and be certain to say, ‘For what reason did Jehovah do like that to this land and to this house?’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And they will have to say, ‘It was for the reason that they left Jehovah the God of their forefathers who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they proceeded to take hold of other gods and bow down to them and serve them. That is why he brought upon them all this calamity.’”</span>

       <span id="vs6">and Ba&acute;al&middot;ath and all the storage cities that had become Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s and all the chariot cities and the cities for the horsemen and every desirable thing of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon that he had desired to build in Jerusalem and in Leb&acute;a&middot;non and in all the land of his dominion.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As for all the people that were left over of the Hit&acute;tites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites, who were no part of Israel,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">from their sons that had been left behind them in the land, whom the sons of Israel had not exterminated, Sol&acute;o&middot;mon kept levying men for forced labor until this day.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But there were none out of the sons of Israel that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon constituted slaves for his work; for they were warriors and chiefs of his adjutants and chiefs of his charioteers and of his horsemen.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">These were the chiefs of the deputies that belonged to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, two hundred and fifty, the foremen over the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter Sol&acute;o&middot;mon brought up out of the City of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said: “Although a wife of mine, she should not dwell in the house of David the king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of Jehovah has come are something holy.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">It was then that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon offered up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah upon the altar of Jehovah that he had built before the porch,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">even as a daily matter of course to make offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the appointed festivals three times in the year, at the festival of unfermented cakes and at the festival of the weeks and at the festival of the booths.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Further, he set the divisions of the priests over their services according to the rule of David his father, and the Levites at their posts of duty, to praise and to minister in front of the priests as a daily matter of course, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates, for such was the commandment of David the man of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And they did not turn aside from the king’s commandment to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter and concerning the supplies.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s work was all in a prepared state from the day of the foundation-laying of the house of Jehovah until it was finished. [So] the house of Jehovah was complete.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">It was then that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went to E&acute;zi&middot;on-ge&acute;ber and to E&acute;loth upon the shore of the sea in the land of E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Hi&acute;ram regularly sent to him by means of his servants ships and servants having a knowledge of the sea, and they would come with Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s servants to O&acute;phir and take from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and bring it to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And the queen of She&acute;ba herself heard the report about Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, and she proceeded to come to test Sol&acute;o&middot;mon with perplexing questions at Jerusalem, along with a very impressive train and camels carrying balsam oil, and gold in great quantity, and precious stones. At length she came in to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon and spoke with him about everything that happened to be close to her heart.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, in turn, went on to tell her all her matters, and no matter was hidden from Sol&acute;o&middot;mon that he did not tell her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">When the queen of She&acute;ba got to see Sol&acute;o&middot;mon’s wisdom and the house that he had built,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the table service of his waiters and their attire and his drinking service and their attire, and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, then there proved to be no more spirit in her.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So she said to the king: “True was the word that I heard in my own land about your matters and about your wisdom.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I did not put faith in their words until I had come that my own eyes might see; and, look! there has not been told me the half of the abundance of your wisdom. You have surpassed the report that I have heard.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Happy are your men, and happy are these servants of yours who are standing before you constantly and listening to your wisdom.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">May Jehovah your God come to be blessed, who has taken delight in you by putting you upon his throne as king for Jehovah your God; because your God loved Israel, to make it stand to time indefinite, so that he put you over them as king to execute judicial decision and righteousness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and balsam oil in very great quantity, and precious stones; and there had not come to be the like of that balsam oil which the queen of She&acute;ba gave to King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And, besides, the servants of Hi&acute;ram and the servants of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon who brought gold from O&acute;phir brought timbers of algum trees and precious stones.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the king proceeded to make out of the timbers of the algum trees stairs for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house and also harps and stringed instruments for the singers, and the like of them had never been seen before in the land of Judah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon himself gave the queen of She&acute;ba all her delight for which she had asked, besides [the value of] what she brought to the king. So she turned about and went to her own land, she together with her servants.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the weight of the gold that came to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon in one year amounted to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">aside from the men of travel and the merchants who were bringing in and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land who were bringing in gold and silver to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon went on to make two hundred large shields of alloyed gold (six hundred [shekels] of alloyed gold he proceeded to lay upon each large shield),</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and three hundred bucklers of alloyed gold (three mi&acute;nas of gold he proceeded to lay upon each buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Leb&acute;a&middot;non.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Further, the king made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And there were six steps to the throne, and there was a footstool in gold to the throne (they were attached), and there were armrests on this side and on that side by the place of sitting, and two lions were standing beside the armrests.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And there were twelve lions standing there upon the six steps on this side and on that side. No other kingdom had any made just like it.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And all the drinking vessels of King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Leb&acute;a&middot;non were of pure gold. There was nothing of silver; it was considered as nothing at all in the days of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For ships belonging to the king were going to Tar&acute;shish with the servants of Hi&acute;ram. Once every three years ships of Tar&acute;shish would come in, carrying gold and silver, ivory, and apes and peacocks.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And all the kings of the earth were seeking the face of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon to hear his wisdom, which the [true] God had put in his heart.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they were bringing each his gift, articles of silver and articles of gold and garments, armor and balsam oil, horses and mules as a yearly matter of course.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon came to have four thousand stalls of horses and chariots and twelve thousand steeds, and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he came to be ruler over all the kings from the River down to the land of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and down to the boundary of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Furthermore, the king made the silver in Jerusalem like the stones; and cedarwood he made like the sycamore trees that are in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah for abundance.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And there were those bringing out horses to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon from Egypt and from all the other lands.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">As for the rest of the affairs of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, the first and the last, are they not written among the words of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of A&middot;hi&acute;jah the Shi&acute;lo&middot;nite and in the record of visions of Id&acute;do the visionary concerning Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And Sol&acute;o&middot;mon continued to reign in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Finally Sol&acute;o&middot;mon lay down with his forefathers. So they buried him in the City of David his father; and Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am proceeded to go to She&acute;chem, for it was to She&acute;chem that all the Israelites came to make him king.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it came about that as soon as Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat heard of it while he was yet in Egypt, (because he had run away on account of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the king,) Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am immediately came back from Egypt.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So they sent and called him, and Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all Israel came and spoke to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Your father, for his part, made our yoke hard; and now make the hard service of your father and the heavy yoke that he put upon us lighter, and we shall serve you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At this he said to them: “Let there be yet three days. Then return to me.” So the people went away.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am began to take counsel with the older men that were continually attending upon Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his father while he continued alive, saying: “How are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> advising to reply to this people?”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Accordingly they spoke to him, saying: “If you would prove yourself good to this people and actually be pleasing to them and indeed speak good words to them, they also will certainly become your servants always.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">However, he left the counsel of the older men with which they had advised him, and he began to take counsel with the young men that had grown up with him, who were the ones attending upon him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he went on to say to them: “What is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are offering in counsel that we may reply to this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put upon us lighter’?”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In turn the young men that had grown up with him spoke with him, saying: “This is what you should say to the people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father, for his part, made our yoke heavy, but, as for you, make it lighter upon us’; this is what you should say to them, ‘My own little finger will certainly be thicker than my father’s hips.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now my father, for his part, loaded upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a heavy yoke, but I, for my part, shall add to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> yoke. My father, for his part, chastised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with whips, but I, for my part, with scourges.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all the people proceeded to come to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am on the third day, just as the king had spoken, saying: “Return to me on the third day.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the king began to answer them harshly. Thus King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am left the counsel of the older men,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and he went on to speak to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: “I shall make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> yoke heavier, and I, for my part, shall add to it. My father, for his part, chastised <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with whips, but I, for my part, with scourges.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the king did not listen to the people; for it proved to be a turn of affairs from the [true] God in order that Jehovah might carry out his word that he had spoken by means of A&middot;hi&acute;jah the Shi&acute;lo&middot;nite to Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">As for all Israel, because the king did not listen to them, the people now replied to the king, saying: “What share do we have in David? And there is no inheritance in the son of Jes&acute;se. Each one to your gods, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David.” With that all Israel began to go to its tents.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As for the sons of Israel that were dwelling in the cities of Judah, Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am continued to reign over them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Subsequently King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am sent Ha&middot;do&acute;ram, who was over those conscripted for forced labor, but the sons of Israel pelted him with stones, so that he died. And King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am himself managed to get up into his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the Israelites kept up their revolt against the house of David down to this day.</span>

       <span id="vs1">When Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am arrived at Jerusalem, he immediately congregated the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand choice men able-bodied for war, to fight against Israel so as to bring the kingdom back to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then the word of Jehovah came to She&middot;mai&acute;ah the man of the [true] God, saying:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“Say to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not go up and fight against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers. Return each one to his house, for it is at my own instance that this thing has been brought about.”’” So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and returned from going against Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am continued to dwell in Jerusalem and proceeded to build fortified cities in Judah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Thus he rebuilt Beth&acute;le&middot;hem and E&acute;tam and Te&middot;ko&acute;a,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs10">and Zo&acute;rah and Ai&acute;ja&middot;lon and He&acute;bron, fortified cities, which were in Judah and Benjamin.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Further, he reinforced the fortified places and put leaders in them and supplies of food and oil and wine,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and in all the different cities large shields and lances; and he went on reinforcing them to a very great degree. And Judah and Benjamin continued his.</span>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the priests and the Levites themselves that were in all Israel took their stand by him out of all their territories.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For the Levites left their pasture grounds and their possession and then came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and his sons had discharged them from acting as priests to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to put in office for himself priests for the high places and for the goat-shaped demons and for the calves that he had made.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And following them from all the tribes of Israel those that were giving their heart to seek Jehovah the God of Israel came themselves to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they kept strengthening the kingship of Judah and confirming Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Sol&acute;o&middot;mon for three years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am took as his wife Ma&acute;ha&middot;lath the daughter of Jer&acute;i&middot;moth the son of David, and of Ab&acute;i&middot;ha&middot;il the daughter of E&middot;li&acute;ab the son of Jes&acute;se.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs20">And after her he took Ma&acute;a&middot;cah the granddaughter of Ab&acute;sa&middot;lom. In time she bore him A&middot;bi&acute;jah and At&acute;tai and Zi&acute;za and She&middot;lo&acute;mith.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am was more in love with Ma&acute;a&middot;cah the granddaughter of Ab&acute;sa&middot;lom than all his other wives and his concubines; for there were eighteen wives that he had taken, also sixty concubines, so that he became father to twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Consequently Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am put A&middot;bi&acute;jah the son of Ma&acute;a&middot;cah in office as head, as leader among his brothers, for [he thought] of making him king.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>

       <span id="vs1">And it came about that, as soon as the kingship of Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am was firmly established and as soon as he was strong, he left the law of Jehovah, and also all Israel with him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it came about in the fifth year of King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am that Shi&acute;shak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, (for they had behaved unfaithfully toward Jehovah,)</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">with twelve hundred chariots and with sixty thousand horsemen; and there was no number to the people that came with him out of Egypt—Lib&acute;y&middot;ans, Suk&acute;ki&middot;im and E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he got to capture the fortified cities that belonged to Judah and finally came as far as Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Now as for She&middot;mai&acute;ah the prophet, he came to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am and the princes of Judah who had gathered themselves at Jerusalem because of Shi&acute;shak, and he proceeded to say to them: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, for your part, have left me, and I, too, for my part, have left <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the hand of Shi&acute;shak.’”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said: “Jehovah is righteous.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And when Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to She&middot;mai&acute;ah, saying: “They have humbled themselves. I shall not bring them to ruin, and in a little while I shall certainly give them an escape, and my rage will not pour forth upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shi&acute;shak.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But they will become servants of his, that they may know the difference between my service and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So Shi&acute;shak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house. Everything he took; and so he took the gold shields that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had made.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Consequently King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am made in their place copper shields, and he committed them to the control of the chiefs of the runners, the guards of the entrance of the king’s house.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it would occur that as often as the king came to the house of Jehovah, the runners came in and carried them and returned them to the guard chamber of the runners.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And because he humbled himself, Jehovah’s anger turned back from him, and he [did] not [think] of bringing them to ruin completely. And, besides, there happened to be good things in Judah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And King Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am continued to make his position strong in Jerusalem and kept reigning; for Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and for seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Na&acute;a&middot;mah the Am&acute;mon&middot;it&middot;ess.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But he did what was bad, for he had not firmly established his heart to search for Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">As for Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am’s affairs, the first and the last, are they not written among the words of She&middot;mai&acute;ah the prophet and of Id&acute;do the visionary by genealogical enrollment? And there were wars between Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am and Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am all the time.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Finally Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am lay down with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David; and A&middot;bi&acute;jah his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">In the eighteenth year of King Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am it was that A&middot;bi&acute;jah began to reign over Judah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the daughter of U&middot;ri&acute;el of Gib&acute;e&middot;ah. And war itself took place between A&middot;bi&acute;jah and Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So A&middot;bi&acute;jah engaged in the war with a military force of four hundred thousand mighty men of war, chosen men. And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am himself drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, valiant, mighty men.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">A&middot;bi&acute;jah now rose up upon Mount Zem&middot;a&middot;ra&acute;im, which is in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im, and said: “Hear me, O Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all Israel.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Is it not for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know that Jehovah the God of Israel himself gave a kingdom to David over Israel to time indefinite, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Ne&acute;bat, the servant of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the son of David, proceeded to rise up and rebel against his lord.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And idle men, good-for-nothing fellows, kept collecting themselves together by him. Finally they proved superior to Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am the son of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon, when Re&middot;ho&middot;bo&acute;am himself happened to be young and fainthearted, and he did not hold his own against them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“And now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are thinking of holding <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are a large crowd and there are with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the golden calves that Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am made for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as gods.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not driven out Jehovah’s priests, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not keep making priests for yourselves like the peoples of the lands? As for anyone that came and filled his hand with power by means of a young bull and seven rams, he became a priest of what are no gods.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">As for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not left him; but priests are ministering to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and also the Levites in the work.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they are making burnt offerings smoke to Jehovah morning by morning and evening by evening and also perfumed incense; and the layers of bread are upon the table of pure [gold], and there are the golden lampstand and its lamps to light up evening by evening; because we are keeping the obligation to Jehovah our God, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves have left him.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And, look! with us there is at the head the [true] God with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. O sons of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not prove successful.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am, for his part, dispatched an ambush around to come behind them, so that they proved to be in front of Judah and the ambush behind them.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">When those of Judah turned around, why, there they had the battle in front and behind. And they began to cry out to Jehovah, while the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the men of Judah broke out shouting a war cry. And it came about that, when the men of Judah shouted a war cry, then the [true] God himself defeated Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and all Israel before A&middot;bi&acute;jah and Judah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the sons of Israel took to flight from before Judah, and then God gave them into their hand.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And A&middot;bi&acute;jah and his people went striking them down with a vast slaughter; and the slain of Israel kept falling down, five hundred thousand chosen men.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Thus the sons of Israel were humbled at that time, but the sons of Judah proved superior because they leaned upon Jehovah the God of their forefathers.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And A&middot;bi&acute;jah kept chasing after Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am and got to capture cities from him, Beth&acute;el and its dependent towns, and Jesh&acute;a&middot;nah and its dependent towns, and E&acute;phra&middot;in and its dependent towns.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Jer&middot;o&middot;bo&acute;am did not retain any more power in the days of A&middot;bi&acute;jah; but Jehovah dealt him a blow, so that he died.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And A&middot;bi&acute;jah continued to strengthen himself. In time he got fourteen wives for himself, and became father to twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the rest of A&middot;bi&acute;jah’s affairs, even his ways and his words, are written in the exposition of the prophet Id&acute;do.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Finally A&middot;bi&acute;jah lay down with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and A&acute;sa his son began to reign in place of him. In his days the land had no disturbance for ten years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And A&acute;sa proceeded to do what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So he removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Further, he said to Judah to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers and to do the law and the commandment.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly he removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense stands; and the kingdom continued without disturbance before him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he went on to build fortified cities in Judah, for the land had no disturbance; and there was no war against him during these years, for Jehovah gave him rest.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So he said to Judah: “Let us build these cities and make walls around and towers, double doors and bars. For us the land is yet available, because we have searched for Jehovah our God. We have searched, and he gives us rest all around.” And they went building and proving successful.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And A&acute;sa came to have a military force bearing the large shield and lance, three hundred thousand out of Judah. And out of Benjamin those bearing the buckler and bending the bow were two hundred and eighty thousand. All these were valiant, mighty men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Later Ze&acute;rah the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;an went out against them with a military force of a million men and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Ma&middot;re&acute;shah.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then A&acute;sa went out against him and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zeph&acute;a&middot;thah at Ma&middot;re&acute;shah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And A&acute;sa began to call to Jehovah his God and say: “O Jehovah, as to helping, it does not matter with you whether there are many or [those with] no power. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that Jehovah defeated the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans before A&acute;sa and before Judah, and the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans took to flight.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And A&acute;sa and the people that were with him kept pursuing them as far as Ge&acute;rar, and those of the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans continued falling down till there was no one alive of them; for they were broken to pieces before Jehovah and before his camp. Afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Further, they struck all the cities round about Ge&acute;rar, for the dread of Jehovah had come to be upon them; and they went plundering all the cities, for there happened to be much to plunder in them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And even the tents with livestock they struck so that they took captive flocks in great number and camels, after which they returned to Jerusalem.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of A&acute;sa, Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the king of Israel came up against Judah and began to build Ra&acute;mah, so as not to allow anyone to go out or come in to A&acute;sa the king of Judah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">A&acute;sa now brought out silver and gold from the treasures of Jehovah’s house and the king’s house and sent to Ben-ha&acute;dad the king of Syria, who was dwelling at Damascus, saying:</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“There is a covenant between me and you and between my father and your father. Here I do send you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So Ben-ha&acute;dad listened to King A&acute;sa and sent the chiefs of the military forces that were his against the cities of Israel, so that they struck I&acute;jon and Dan and A&acute;bel-ma&acute;im and all the storage places of the cities of Naph&acute;ta&middot;li.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it came about that as soon as Ba&acute;a&middot;sha heard of it, he immediately quit building Ra&acute;mah and stopped his work.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">As for A&acute;sa the king, he took all Judah, and they proceeded to carry away the stones of Ra&acute;mah and its timbers with which Ba&acute;a&middot;sha had built, and he began to build with them Ge&acute;ba and Miz&acute;pah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And at that time Ha&middot;na&acute;ni the seer came to A&acute;sa the king of Judah and then said to him: “Because you leaned upon the king of Syria and did not lean upon Jehovah your God, for that reason the military force of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Did not the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans and the Lib&acute;y&middot;ans themselves happen to be a very great military force in multitude, in chariots and in horsemen; and because of your leaning upon Jehovah did he not give them into your hand?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For, as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him. You have acted foolishly respecting this, for from now on there will exist wars against you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">However, A&acute;sa became offended at the seer and put him in the house of the stocks, because he was in a rage at him over this. And A&acute;sa began to crush some others of the people at that same time.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And, look! the affairs of A&acute;sa, the first and the last, there they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And A&acute;sa in the thirty-ninth year of his reign developed an ailment in his feet until he was very sick; and even in his sickness he searched not for Jehovah but for the healers.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Finally A&acute;sa lay down with his forefathers and died in the forty-first year of his reigning.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So they buried him in his grand burial place that he had excavated for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ointment mixed in an ointment of special make. Further, they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him.</span>

       <span id="vs5">So the king of Israel collected the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them: “Shall we go against Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad in war, or shall I refrain?” And they began to say: “Go up, and the [true] God will give [it] into the king’s hand.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat said: “Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah still? Then let us inquire through him.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">At that the king of Israel said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “There is still one man through whom to inquire of Jehovah, but I myself certainly hate him, for he is prophesying concerning me, not for good, but, all his days, for bad. He is Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the son of Im&acute;lah.” However, Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat said: “Do not let the king say a thing like that.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Accordingly the king of Israel called a court official and said: “Bring Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the son of Im&acute;lah quickly.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now the king of Israel and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah were sitting each one on his throne, clothed in garments, and were sitting in the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Che&middot;na&acute;a&middot;nah made for himself horns of iron and said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘With these you will push the Syrians until you exterminate them.’”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all the other prophets were prophesying the same as that, saying: “Go up to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad and prove successful, and Jehovah will certainly give [it] into the king’s hand.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the messenger that went to call Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah spoke to him, saying: “Look! The words of the prophets are unanimously of good to the king; and let your word, please, become like one of them and you must speak good.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “As Jehovah is living, what my God will say, that is what I shall speak.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then he came in to the king, and the king proceeded to say to him: “Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah, shall we go to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad in war, or shall I refrain?” At once he said: “Go up and prove successful; and they will be given into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At that the king said to him: “For how many times am I putting you under oath that you should not speak to me anything but truth in the name of Jehovah?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So he said: “I certainly see all the Israelites scattered upon the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah went on to say: ‘These have no masters. Let them go back each one to his house in peace.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then the king of Israel said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “Did I not say to you, ‘He will prophesy concerning me, not good things, but bad’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And he went on to say: “Therefore <span class="smallcaps">HEAR</span> the word of Jehovah: I certainly see Jehovah sitting upon his throne and all the army of the heavens standing at his right and his left.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Jehovah proceeded to say, ‘Who will fool A&acute;hab the king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad?’ And there was talk, this one saying something like this, and that one saying something like that.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Finally a spirit came out and stood before Jehovah and said, ‘I myself shall fool him.’ At that Jehovah said to him, ‘By what means?’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">To this he said, ‘I shall go forth and certainly become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ So he said, ‘You will fool him, and, what is more, you will come off the winner. Go out and do that way.’</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And now here Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; but Jehovah himself has spoken calamity concerning you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Che&middot;na&acute;a&middot;nah now approached and struck Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah on the cheek and said: “In just which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass along from me to speak with you?”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">At that Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “Look! You are seeing [which way] on that day when you will enter the innermost chamber to hide yourself.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then the king of Israel said: “T<span class="smallcaps">AKE</span> Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah and turn him back to A&acute;mon the chief of the city and to Jo&acute;ash the king’s son.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men must say, ‘This is what the king has said: “P<span class="smallcaps">UT</span> this fellow in the house of detention and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and a reduced allowance of water until I return in peace.”’”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Upon that Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah said: “If you return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.” And he added: “Hear, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> peoples.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the king of Israel and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah proceeded to go up to Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The king of Israel now said to Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat: “There will be a disguising and entering into the battle [for me], but you, for your part, put on your garments.” Accordingly the king of Israel disguised himself, after which they entered into the battle.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">As for the king of Syria, he had commanded the chiefs of the chariots that were his, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must fight, neither with the small nor with the great, but with the king of Israel alone.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And it came about that, as soon as the chiefs of the chariots saw Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, they, for their part, said to themselves: “It is the king of Israel.” So they turned around against him to fight; and Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And it came about that as soon as the chiefs of the chariots saw that it did not prove to be the king of Israel, they immediately came back from following him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And there was a man that bent the bow in his innocence, but he got to strike the king of Israel between the appendages and the coat of mail, so that he said to the charioteer: “Turn your hand around, and you must take me out from the camp, because I have been badly wounded.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And the battle kept rising in intensity on that day, and the king of Israel himself had to be kept in a standing position in the chariot facing the Syrians until the evening; and gradually he died at the time of the setting of the sun.</span>

       <span id="vs2">So people came and told Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, saying: “There has come against you a large crowd from the region of the sea, from E&acute;dom; and there they are in Haz&acute;a&middot;zon-ta&acute;mar, that is to say, En-ge&acute;di.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

       <span id="vs9">‘If there should come upon us calamity, sword, adverse judgment, or pestilence or famine, let us stand before this house and before you (for your name is in this house), that we may call to you for aid out of our distress, and may you hear and save.’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And now here the sons of Am&acute;mon, and Mo&acute;ab and the mountainous region of Se&acute;ir, whom you did not allow Israel to invade when they were coming out of the land of Egypt, but they turned away from them and did not annihilate them,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs12">O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them? For in us there is no power before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we ourselves do not know what we ought to do, but our eyes are toward you.”</span>

       <span id="vs14">Now as for Ja&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;el the son of Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Be&middot;nai&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;i&acute;el the son of Mat&middot;ta&middot;ni&acute;ah the Levite of the sons of A&acute;saph, the spirit of Jehovah came to be upon him in the middle of the congregation.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Consequently he said: “Pay attention, all Judah and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat! Here is what Jehovah has said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘Do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd; for the battle is not <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>, but God’s.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Tomorrow go down against them. There they are coming up by the pass of Ziz; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be certain to find them at the end of the torrent valley in front of the wilderness of Je&middot;ru&acute;el.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will not need to fight in this instance. Take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> position, stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> behalf. O Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid or be terrified. Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At once Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat bowed low with his face to the earth, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem themselves fell down before Jehovah to do obeisance to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then the Levites of the sons of the Ko&acute;hath&middot;ites and of the sons of the Ko&acute;rah&middot;ites rose up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with an extraordinarily loud voice.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And they proceeded to rise early in the morning and go out to the wilderness of Te&middot;ko&acute;a. And as they went out, Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat stood up and then said: “Hear me, O Judah and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabitants of Jerusalem! Put faith in Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may prove yourselves of long duration. Put faith in his prophets and so prove successful.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Further, he took counsel with the people and stationed singers to Jehovah and those offering praise in holy adornment as they went out ahead of the armed men, and saying: “G<span class="smallcaps">IVE</span> praise to Jehovah, for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And at the time that they started off with the joyful cry and praise, Jehovah set men in ambush against the sons of Am&acute;mon, Mo&acute;ab and the mountainous region of Se&acute;ir who were coming into Judah, and they went smiting one another.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the sons of Am&acute;mon and Mo&acute;ab proceeded to stand up against the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Se&acute;ir to devote them to destruction and annihilate them; and as soon as they finished with the inhabitants of Se&acute;ir, they helped each one to bring his own fellow to ruin.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But as for Judah, it came to the watchtower of the wilderness. When they turned their faces toward the crowd, why, there they were, their carcasses fallen to the earth without anyone escaping.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat and his people came to plunder the spoil on them, and they got to find among them in abundance both goods and clothing and desirable articles; and they went stripping them off for themselves until they could carry no more. And it came to be three days that they were plundering the spoil, for it was abundant.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And on the fourth day they congregated together at the low plain of Ber&acute;a&middot;cah, for there they blessed Jehovah. That is why they called the name of that place Low Plain of Ber&acute;a&middot;cah—until today.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat at their head, to return to Jerusalem with rejoicing, for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So they came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and with harps and with trumpets to the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the dread of God came to be upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Thus the royal realm of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat had no disturbance, and his God continued to give him rest all around.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat went on reigning over Judah. Thirty-five years old he was when he began to reign, and for twenty-five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was A&middot;zu&acute;bah the daughter of Shil&acute;hi.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And he kept walking in the way of his father A&acute;sa, and he did not turn aside from it, by doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Only the high places themselves did not disappear; and the people themselves had not yet prepared their heart for the God of their forefathers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">As for the rest of the affairs of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, the first and the last, there they are written among the words of Je&acute;hu the son of Ha&middot;na&acute;ni, which were inserted in the Book of the Kings of Israel.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And after this Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Judah had partnership with A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah the king of Israel, who acted wickedly.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">So he made him a partner with himself in making ships to go to Tar&acute;shish and they made ships in E&acute;zi&middot;on-ge&acute;ber.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">However, E&middot;li&middot;e&acute;zer the son of Dod&middot;av&acute;a&middot;hu of Ma&middot;re&acute;sha spoke prophetically against Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, saying: “Inasmuch as you have had partnership with A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah, Jehovah will certainly break down your works.” Accordingly the ships were wrecked, and they did not retain strength to go to Tar&acute;shish.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Finally Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat lay down with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David; and Je&middot;ho&acute;ram his son began to reign in place of him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he had brothers, Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat’s sons, Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Je&middot;hi&acute;el and Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Mi&acute;cha&middot;el and Sheph&middot;a&middot;ti&acute;ah, all these being the sons of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Consequently their father gave them many gifts in silver and in gold and in choice things along with fortified cities in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Je&middot;ho&acute;ram, for he was the firstborn.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When Je&middot;ho&acute;ram rose up over the kingdom of his father he proceeded to make his position strong, and so he killed all his brothers with the sword and also some of the princes of Israel.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Thirty-two years old was Je&middot;ho&acute;ram when he began to reign, and for eight years he reigned in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he went on walking in the way of the kings of Israel, just as those of the house of A&acute;hab had done; for A&acute;hab’s own daughter had become his wife, and he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Jehovah did not want to bring the house of David to ruin, for the sake of the covenant that he had concluded with David, and just as he had said he would give him and his sons a lamp always.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In his days E&acute;dom revolted from under the hand of Judah and then made a king to reign over them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So Je&middot;ho&acute;ram together with his chiefs passed over and also all the chariots with him. And it came about that he rose up by night and went striking down the E&acute;dom&middot;ites that were surrounding him and also the chiefs of the chariots.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But E&acute;dom kept up its revolt from under the hand of Judah down to this day. It was then that Lib&acute;nah began to revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had left Jehovah the God of his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">He himself also had made high places on the mountains of Judah, that he might cause the inhabitants of Jerusalem to have immoral intercourse, and that he might drive Judah away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Eventually there came a writing to him from E&middot;li&acute;jah the prophet, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather has said, ‘Due to the fact that you have not walked in the ways of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat your father or in the ways of A&acute;sa the king of Judah,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">but you walk in the way of the kings of Israel and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to have immoral intercourse the same way that the house of A&acute;hab caused the having of immoral intercourse, and even your own brothers, the household of your father, who were better than you, you have killed;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">look! Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people and to your sons and to your wives and to all your goods.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And you will be with many sicknesses, with a malady of your intestines, until your intestines have come out because of the sickness day by day.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly Jehovah aroused against Je&middot;ho&acute;ram the spirit of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and the Arabs that were by the side of the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;ans.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So they came up into Judah and forced it open and took captive all the goods that were to be found in the king’s house and also his sons and his wives, and there was not left to him a son but Je&middot;ho&acute;a&middot;haz, his youngest son.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And after all this Jehovah plagued him in his intestines with a sickness for which there was no healing.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And it came about that in the days to come, even when the term of two full years had expired, his intestines came out during his sickness, and he gradually died in his bad maladies; and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning for his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Thirty-two years old he happened to be when he began to reign, and for eight years he reigned in Jerusalem. Finally he went away without being desired. So they buried him in the City of David, but not in the burial places of the kings.</span>

       <span id="vs2">Twenty-two years old was A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah when he began to reign, and for one year he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the granddaughter of Om&acute;ri.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He himself also walked in the ways of the house of A&acute;hab, for his mother herself became his counselor in doing wickedly.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he went on doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, the same as the house of A&acute;hab, for they themselves became counselors to him after the death of his father, to his ruination.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">It was also in their counsel that he walked, so that he went with Je&middot;ho&acute;ram the son of A&acute;hab the king of Israel to the war against Haz&acute;a&middot;el the king of Syria at Ra&acute;moth-gil&acute;e&middot;ad, at which the shooters got to strike Je&middot;ho&acute;ram.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs7">But it was from God that the downfall of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah occurred by [his] coming to Je&middot;ho&acute;ram; and when he came, he went out with Je&middot;ho&acute;ram to Je&acute;hu the grandson of Nim&acute;shi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of A&acute;hab.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about that as soon as Je&acute;hu had entered into controversy with the house of A&acute;hab, he got to find the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah, ministers of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah, and he proceeded to kill them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then he went looking for A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah, and they finally captured him, as he was hiding in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, and brought him to Je&acute;hu. Then they put him to death and buried him, for they said: “He is the grandson of Je&middot;hosh&acute;a&middot;phat, who searched for Jehovah with all his heart.” And there was no one of the house of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah to retain power for the kingdom.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">As regards Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the mother of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah, she saw that her son had died. So she rose up and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, Je&middot;ho&middot;shab&acute;e&middot;ath the daughter of the king took Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the son of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah and stole him away from among the sons of the king that were to be put to death, and put him and his nursing woman in the inner room for the couches. And Je&middot;ho&middot;shab&acute;e&middot;ath the daughter of King Je&middot;ho&acute;ram, the wife of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest, (for she herself happened to be the sister of A&middot;ha&middot;zi&acute;ah,) kept him concealed because of Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah, and she did not put him to death.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And he continued with them in the house of the [true] God hidden for six years, while Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah was ruling as queen over the land.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And in the seventh year Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da showed himself courageous and proceeded to take the chiefs of hundreds, namely, Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;ro&acute;ham, and Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Je&middot;ho&middot;ha&acute;nan and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of O&acute;bed and Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the son of A&middot;dai&acute;ah and E&middot;li&middot;sha&acute;phat the son of Zich&acute;ri, with him into the covenant.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Afterward they went around throughout Judah and collected together the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the paternal houses of Israel. So they came to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then all the congregation concluded a covenant with the king in the house of the [true] God, after which he said to them:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“Look! The son of the king himself will reign, just as Jehovah promised concerning the sons of David.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">This is the thing that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will do: one third of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are coming in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, will be for doorkeepers;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and one third will be at the house of the king; and one third will be at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people will be in the courtyards of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And do not let anyone enter the house of Jehovah but the priests and those of the Levites ministering. These are the ones that will enter, because they are a holy group, and all the people themselves will keep the obligation to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the Levites must encircle the king all around, each one with his weapons in his hands; and as for anyone coming into the house, he should be put to death. And continue with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the Levites and all Judah proceeded to do according to all that Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest had commanded. So they took each one his men that were coming in on the sabbath together with those going out on the sabbath, for Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest had not set the divisions free from duty.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Further, Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the shields and the circular shields that had belonged to King David, which were in the house of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And he went on to station all the people, even each one with his missile in his hand, from the right side of the house clear to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, all around near the king.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Then they brought the king’s son out and put upon him the diadem and the Testimony and made him king, and so Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da and his sons anointed him and said: “Let the king live!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she at once came to the people at the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then she saw, and there was the king standing by his pillar at the entry, and the princes and the trumpets by the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets, and the singers with the instruments of song and those giving the signal for offering praise. Immediately Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah ripped her garments apart and said: “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest brought out the chiefs of hundreds, the appointed ones of the military force, and said to them: “Take her out from inside the rows; and as for anyone coming after her, he should be put to death with the sword!” For the priest had said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not put her to death at the house of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So they laid their hands upon her. When she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house, they at once put her to death there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da concluded a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they would continue as the people of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">After that all the people came to the house of Ba&acute;al and pulled it down; and his altars and his images they broke up, and Mat&acute;tan the priest of Ba&acute;al they killed before the altars.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Further, Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da put the offices of the house of Jehovah in the hand of the priests [and] the Levites, whom David had put in divisions over the house of Jehovah to offer up the burnt sacrifices of Jehovah according to what is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with song by the hands of David.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So he stationed the gatekeepers by the gates of the house of Jehovah that no one unclean in any respect might enter.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">He now took the chiefs of hundreds and the lordly ones and the rulers over the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the house of Jehovah. Then they came right through the upper gate to the king’s house and seated the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And all the people of the land continued to rejoice; and the city itself had no disturbance, and Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah they had put to death with the sword.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Seven years old was Je&middot;ho&acute;ash when he began to reign, and for forty years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zib&acute;i&middot;ah from Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Je&middot;ho&acute;ash kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes all the days of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da proceeded to get two wives for him, and he came to be father to sons and daughters.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Now it occurred afterward that it became close to the heart of Je&middot;ho&acute;ash to renovate the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Accordingly he collected the priests and the Levites together and said to them: “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God from year to year; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> part, should act quickly in the matter.” And the Levites did not act quickly.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So the king called Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the head and said to him: “Why is it that you have not required an account of the Levites for bringing in from Judah and Jerusalem the sacred tax ordered by Moses the servant of Jehovah, even that of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the Testimony?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For as regards Ath&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the wicked woman, her sons themselves had broken into the house of the [true] God, and even all the holy things of the house of Jehovah they had rendered up to the Ba&acute;als.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then the king said [the word], and so they made a chest and put it outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">After that they issued a call throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the sacred tax ordered by Moses the servant of the [true] God upon Israel in the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And all the princes and all the people began to rejoice, and they kept bringing and casting it into the chest until they all had given.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it came about at the proper time he would bring the chest to the care of the king by the hand of the Levites, and, as soon as they saw that there was plenty of money, the secretary of the king and the commissioner of the chief priest came and then emptied the chest and lifted it up and returned it to its place. That was the way they did from day to day, so that they gathered money in abundance.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then the king and Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da would give it to the doers of the work of the service of Jehovah’s house, and they came to be hirers of the stonecutters and of the craftsmen for renovating Jehovah’s house, and also of the workers in iron and copper for repairing Jehovah’s house.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the doers of the work began operations, and the repair work kept advancing by their hand, and finally they made the house of the [true] God stand as it structurally should and made it strong.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And as soon as they had finished they brought before the king and Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the rest of the money, and they proceeded to make utensils for the house of Jehovah, utensils for the ministry and for making offerings and cups and utensils of gold and of silver; and they came to be offerers of burnt sacrifices in the house of Jehovah constantly all the days of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da got to be old and satisfied with years and gradually died, being a hundred and thirty years old at his death.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So they buried him in the City of David along with the kings, because he had done good in Israel and with the [true] God and His house.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And after Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da’s death the princes of Judah came in and proceeded to bow down to the king. At that time the king listened to them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And gradually they left the house of Jehovah the God of their forefathers and began serving the sacred poles and the idols, so that there came to be indignation against Judah and Jerusalem because of this guilt of theirs.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he kept sending prophets among them to bring them back to Jehovah; and they kept bearing witness against them, but they did not give ear.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And God’s spirit itself enveloped Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest, so that he stood up above the people and said to them: “This is what the [true] God has said, ‘Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> overstepping the commandments of Jehovah, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cannot prove successful? Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have left Jehovah, he will, in turn, leave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Finally they conspired against him and pelted him with stones at the king’s commandment in the courtyard of Jehovah’s house.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the king did not remember the loving-kindness that Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da his father had exercised toward him, so that he killed his son, who, when he was at the point of dying, said: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And it came about at the turn of the year a military force of Syria came up against him, and they began to invade Judah and Jerusalem. Then they brought all the princes of the people to ruin from among the people, and all their spoil they sent to the king of Damascus.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For it was with a small number of men that the military force of the Syrians made an invasion, and Jehovah himself gave into their hand a military force of very great number, because they had left Jehovah the God of their forefathers; and upon Je&middot;ho&acute;ash they executed acts of judgment.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And when they went away from him (for they left him with many diseases), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest; and they got to kill him upon his own couch, so that he died. Then they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the burial places of the kings.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And these were the conspirators against him: Za&acute;bad the son of Shim&acute;e&middot;ath the Am&acute;mon&middot;it&middot;ess and Je&middot;hoz&acute;a&middot;bad the son of Shim&acute;rith the Mo&acute;ab&middot;i&middot;tess.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">As for his sons and the abundance of the pronouncement against him and the founding of the house of the [true] God, there they are written in the exposition of the Book of the Kings. And Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="28">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">At the age of twenty-five years Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah became king, and for twenty-nine years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Je&middot;ho&middot;ad&acute;dan of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, only not with a complete heart.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it came about that as soon as the kingdom had become strong upon him, he promptly killed his servants who had struck down the king his father.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And their sons he did not put to death, but [did] according to what is written in the law, in the book of Moses, that Jehovah commanded, saying: “Fathers should not die for sons, neither should sons themselves die for fathers; but it is each one for his own sin that they should die.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah proceeded to collect Judah together and to have them stand according to the house of the forefathers, by the chiefs of thousands and by the chiefs of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin; and he went on to register them from twenty years of age upward, and finally he found them [to be] three hundred thousand choice men going out to the army, handling lance and large shield.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Further, he hired from Israel a hundred thousand valiant, mighty men for a hundred silver talents.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And a certain man of the [true] God came to him, saying: “O king, do not let the army of Israel come with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel, [that is,] all the sons of E&acute;phra&middot;im.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But come you yourself, act, be courageous for the war. The [true] God could cause you to stumble before an enemy; for there exists power with God to help and to cause stumbling.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah said to the man of the [true] God: “But what is there to do about the hundred talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?” To this the man of the [true] God said: “There exists with Jehovah the means to give you much more than this.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Accordingly Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah separated them, namely, the troops that had come to him from E&acute;phra&middot;im, to go to their own place. However, their anger got very hot against Judah, so that they returned to their own place in the heat of anger.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah, for his part, took courage and proceeded to lead his own people and go to the Valley of Salt; and he went striking down the sons of Se&acute;ir, ten thousand [of them].</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And there were ten thousand that the sons of Judah captured alive. So they brought them to the top of the crag, and proceeded to throw them from the top of the crag; and they, one and all, burst apart.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">As for the members of the troop whom Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah had sent back from going with him to the war, they began making raids upon the cities of Judah, from Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a clear to Beth-ho&acute;ron, and went striking down three thousand of them and taking a great plunder.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But it occurred after Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah came from striking down the E&acute;dom&middot;ites that he now brought the gods of the sons of Se&acute;ir and set them up for himself as gods, and before them he began to bow down, and to them he began to make sacrificial smoke.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Consequently Jehovah’s anger became hot against Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah, and so he sent a prophet to him and said to him: “Why have you searched for the people’s gods that did not deliver their own people out of your hand?”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it came about when he spoke to him that [the king] immediately said to him: “Was it a counselor of the king that we constituted you? Quit for your own sake. Why should they strike you down?” Accordingly the prophet quit, but he said: “I certainly know that God has resolved to bring you to ruin, because you have done this and you have not listened to my counsel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah the king of Judah took counsel and sent to Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the son of Je&middot;ho&acute;a&middot;haz the son of Je&acute;hu the king of Israel, saying: “Come! Let us look each other in the face.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At that Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the king of Israel sent to Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah the king of Judah, saying: “The thorny weed itself that was in Leb&acute;a&middot;non sent to the cedar that was in Leb&acute;a&middot;non, saying, ‘Do give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ However, a wild beast of the field that was in Leb&acute;a&middot;non passed by and trampled the thorny weed down.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">You have said to yourself, Here you have struck down E&acute;dom. And your heart has lifted you up to be glorified. Now do keep dwelling in your own house. Why should you engage in strife in a bad position and have to fall, you and Judah with you?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah did not listen; for it was from the [true] God for the purpose of giving them into his hand, because they had searched for the gods of E&acute;dom.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the king of Israel went up, and they proceeded to look each other in the face, he and Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah the king of Judah, at Beth-she&acute;mesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Judah came to be defeated before Israel, so that they took to flight each one to his tent.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And it was Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah the king of Judah, the son of Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the son of Je&middot;ho&acute;a&middot;haz, that Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the king of Israel seized at Beth-she&acute;mesh, after which he brought him to Jerusalem and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of E&acute;phra&middot;im clear to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And [he took] all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were to be found in the house of the [true] God with O&acute;bed-e&acute;dom and the treasures of the king’s house and the hostages, and then returned to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the king of Judah continued to live after the death of Je&middot;ho&acute;ash the son of Je&middot;ho&acute;a&middot;haz the king of Israel fifteen years.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As for the rest of the affairs of Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah, the first and the last, look! are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And from the time that Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah turned aside from following Jehovah, they proceeded to form a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. At length he fled to La&acute;chish; but they sent after him to La&acute;chish and put him to death there.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So they carried him upon horses and buried him with his forefathers in the city of Judah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then all the people of Judah took Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah, he being sixteen years old, and they made him king in place of his father Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">He it was that rebuilt E&acute;loth and then restored it to Judah after the king had lain down with his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Sixteen years old was Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah when he began to reign, and for fifty-two years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Je&middot;co&middot;li&acute;ah of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that Am&middot;a&middot;zi&acute;ah his father had done.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he continually tended to search for God in the days of Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah, the instructor in the fear of the [true] God; and, in the days of his searching for Jehovah, the [true] God made him prosperous.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he proceeded to go out and fight against the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and break through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jab&acute;neh and the wall of Ash&acute;dod, after which he built cities in Ash&acute;dod [territory] and among the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the [true] God continued to help him against the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines and against the Arabians that were dwelling in Gur&middot;ba&acute;al and the Me&middot;u&acute;nim.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the Am&acute;mon&middot;ites began to give tribute to Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah. Eventually his fame went even as far as Egypt, for he displayed strength to an extraordinary degree.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Moreover, Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah built towers in Jerusalem by the Corner Gate and by the Valley Gate and by the Buttress, and made them strong.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Further, he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns (for there was a great deal of livestock that became his), and also in the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and on the tableland. There were farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Car&acute;mel, for a lover of agriculture he proved to be.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Moreover, Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah came to have a force engaging in war, those going out on military service in troops, by the number of their registration by the hand of Je&middot;i&acute;el the secretary and Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the officer under the control of Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah of the king’s princes.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The entire number of the heads of the paternal houses, of the valiant, mighty men, was two thousand six hundred.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And under their control the army forces were three hundred and seven thousand five hundred men engaging in war with the power of a military force to help the king against the enemy.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah continued to prepare for them, for the entire army, shields and lances and helmets and coats of mail and bows and slingstones.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Further, he made in Jerusalem engines of war, the invention of engineers, that they might come to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. Consequently his fame went out to a great distance, for he was helped wonderfully until he was strong.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">However, as soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty even to the point of causing ruin, so that he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God and came into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Immediately Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the priest and with him priests of Jehovah, eighty valiant men, came in after him.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then they stood up against Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah the king and said to him: “It is not your business, O Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but it is the business of the priests the sons of Aaron, the ones sanctified, to burn incense. Go out from the sanctuary; for you have acted unfaithfully, and it is not for any glory to you on the part of Jehovah God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah became enraged while in his hand there was a censer for burning incense, and, during his rage against the priests, leprosy itself flashed up in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah beside the altar of incense.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">When Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the chief priest and all the priests turned toward him, why, there he was stricken with leprosy in his forehead! So they excitedly began to remove him from there, and he himself also hastened to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah the king continued to be a leper until the day of his death, and he kept dwelling in a house exempt from duties, as a leper; for he had been severed from the house of Jehovah, while Jo&acute;tham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that Uz&middot;zi&acute;ah his father had done. Only he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. However, the people were yet acting ruinously.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He himself built the upper gate of Jehovah’s house, and on the wall of O&acute;phel he did a great deal of building.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs1">Twenty years old was A&acute;haz when he began to reign, and for sixteen years he reigned in Jerusalem, and he did not do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes like David his forefather.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even molten statues he made of the Ba&acute;als.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he himself made sacrificial smoke in the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom and proceeded to burn up his sons in the fire, according to the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he regularly sacrificed and made sacrificial smoke on the high places and upon the hills and under every sort of luxuriant tree.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Consequently Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, so that they struck him and carried off from him a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus. And also into the hand of the king of Israel he was given, so that he struck him with a great slaughter.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly Pe&acute;kah the son of Rem&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah killed in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because of their leaving Jehovah the God of their forefathers.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Further, Zich&acute;ri, a mighty man of E&acute;phra&middot;im, killed Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the son of the king and Az&middot;ri&acute;kam the leader of the household and El&middot;ka&acute;nah the one next to the king.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Moreover, the sons of Israel took two hundred thousand of their brothers captive, women, sons and daughters; and also a great deal of spoil they took from them as plunder, after which they brought the spoil to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And there happened to be a prophet of Jehovah there whose name was O&acute;ded. So he went out before the army that was coming to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and said to them: “Look! It was because of the rage of Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers against Judah that he gave them into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did a killing among them with a raging that has reached clear to the heavens.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And now the sons of Judah and of Jerusalem <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are thinking of reducing to menservants and maidservants for yourselves. Nevertheless, are there not with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves cases of guilt against Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now listen to me and return the captives that you have captured from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, for Jehovah’s burning anger is against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that [certain] men of the heads of the sons of E&acute;phra&middot;im, Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;ho&middot;ha&acute;nan, Ber&middot;e&middot;chi&acute;ah the son of Me&middot;shil&acute;le&middot;moth and Je&middot;hiz&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Shal&acute;lum and A&middot;ma&acute;sa the son of Had&acute;lai, rose up against those coming in from the military campaign,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and they said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not bring in the captives here, for it will result in guilt against Jehovah on our part. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are thinking of adding to our sins and to our guilt, for abundant is the guilt we have, and there is burning anger against Israel.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Accordingly the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the congregation.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then the men that were designated by their names rose up and took hold of the captives, and all their naked ones they clothed from the spoil. So they clothed them and furnished them with sandals and fed them and gave them drink and greased them. Furthermore, in the case of anyone tottering, they gave them transportation on the asses and brought them to Jer&acute;i&middot;cho, the city of palm trees, beside their brothers. After that they returned to Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that time King A&acute;haz sent to the kings of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a for them to help him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And once again the E&acute;dom&middot;ites themselves came in and went striking down Judah and carrying off captives.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">As for the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines, they made a raid upon the cities of the She&middot;phe&acute;lah and the Neg&acute;eb of Judah and got to capture Beth-she&acute;mesh and Ai&acute;ja&middot;lon and Ge&middot;de&acute;roth and So&acute;co and its dependent towns and Tim&acute;nah and its dependent towns and Gim&acute;zo and its dependent towns; and they took up dwelling there.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For Jehovah humbled Judah on account of A&acute;haz the king of Israel, because he let unrestraint grow in Judah, and there was an acting with great unfaithfulness toward Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Eventually Til&acute;gath-pil&middot;ne&acute;ser the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a came against him and caused him distress, and did not strengthen him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For A&acute;haz stripped the house of Jehovah and the house of the king and of the princes and thus made a gift to the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a; but it was of no assistance to him.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">However, at the time that he was causing him distress, he acted unfaithfully still more toward Jehovah, that is, King A&acute;haz did.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he began to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus that were striking him, and he went on to say: “Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them, to them I shall sacrifice, that they may help me.” And they themselves became to him a cause for making him and all Israel stumble.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Furthermore, A&acute;haz gathered together the utensils of the house of the [true] God and cut to pieces the utensils of the house of the [true] God, and closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made altars for himself at every corner in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And in all cities, even the cities of Judah, he made high places for making sacrificial smoke to other gods, so that he offended Jehovah the God of his forefathers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As for the rest of his affairs and all his ways, the first and the last, there they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Finally A&acute;haz lay down with his forefathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the burial places of the kings of Israel. And Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And he kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that David his forefather had done.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He himself, in the first year of his reigning, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and began to repair them.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then he brought the priests and the Levites and gathered them to the open place to the east.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he proceeded to say to them: “Listen to me, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> Levites. Now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, and bring the impure thing out from the holy place.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For our fathers have acted unfaithfully and have done what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah our God, so that they left him and turned around their face away from the tabernacle of Jehovah and offered the back of the neck.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They also closed the doors of the porch and kept the lamps extinguished, and incense they did not burn, and burnt sacrifice they did not offer up in the holy place to the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Jehovah’s indignation came to be against Judah and Jerusalem, so that he constituted them an object at which to quake, an object of astonishment and a cause for whistling, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are seeing with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own eyes.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And here our forefathers fell by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives were in captivity for this.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Now it is close to my heart to conclude a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that his burning anger may turn back from us.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Now, my sons, do not give yourselves up to rest, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him and to continue as his ministers and makers of sacrificial smoke.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that the Levites rose up, Ma&acute;hath the son of A&middot;ma&acute;sai and Joel the son of Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah of the sons of the Ko&acute;hath&middot;ites; and from the sons of Me&middot;rar&acute;i, Kish the son of Ab&acute;di and Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hal&acute;le&middot;lel; and from the Ger&acute;shon&middot;ites, Jo&acute;ah the son of Zim&acute;mah and E&acute;den the son of Jo&acute;ah;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and from the sons of E&middot;li&middot;za&acute;phan, Shim&acute;ri and Je&middot;u&acute;el; and from the sons of A&acute;saph, Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Mat&middot;ta&middot;ni&acute;ah;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and from the sons of He&acute;man, Je&middot;hi&acute;el and Shim&acute;e&middot;i; and from the sons of Je&middot;du&acute;thun, She&middot;mai&acute;ah and Uz&acute;zi&middot;el.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then they gathered their brothers together and sanctified themselves and came according to the king’s commandment in the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The priests now came inside the house of Jehovah to do the cleansing and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah to the courtyard of the house of Jehovah. In turn the Levites received it to take it out to the torrent valley of Kid&acute;ron outside.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Thus they got started on the first [day] of the first month at sanctifying, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; so that they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">After that they came inside to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king and said: “We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table of the layer bread and all its utensils.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And all the utensils that King A&acute;haz removed from employment during his reign in his unfaithfulness we have prepared, and have sanctified them; and there they are before the altar of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king proceeded to get up early and gather the princes of the city together and go up to the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they came bringing seven bulls and seven rams and seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. So he said to the sons of Aaron the priests to offer them up upon the altar of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Accordingly they slaughtered the cattle and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it upon the altar; after which they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood upon the altar, and they slaughtered the male lambs and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering near before the king and the congregation and laid their hands upon them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">The priests now slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; because it was for all Israel that the king said the burnt offering and the sin offering [should be].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Meantime, he had the Levites stationed at the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, with stringed instruments and with harps, by the commandment of David and of Gad the king’s visionary and of Nathan the prophet, for it was by the hand of Jehovah that the commandment was by means of his prophets.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So the Levites kept standing with the instruments of David, and also the priests with the trumpets.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said to offer up the burnt sacrifice on the altar; and at the time that the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, even under the direction of the instruments of David the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And all the congregation were bowing down while the song was resounding and the trumpets were blaring—all this until the burnt offering was finished.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And as soon as they finished offering it up, the king and all those found with him bowed low and prostrated themselves.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king and the princes now said to the Levites to praise Jehovah in the words of David and of A&acute;saph the visionary. So they began to offer praise even with rejoicing, and they kept bending down and prostrating themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Finally Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah answered and said: “Now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have filled <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand with power for Jehovah. Approach, and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices to the house of Jehovah.” And the congregation began to bring sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices, and also every one willing of heart, burnt offerings.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And the number of the burnt offerings that the congregation brought came to be seventy cattle, a hundred rams, two hundred male lambs—all these as a burnt offering to Jehovah;</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">and also the holy offerings, six hundred cattle and three thousand of the flock.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Only the priests themselves happened to be too few, and they were not able to skin all the burnt offerings. So their brothers the Levites helped them out until the work was finished and until the priests could sanctify themselves, for the Levites were more upright of heart for sanctifying themselves than the priests.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And, too, the burnt offerings were in great quantity with the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was prepared.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Consequently Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah and all the people rejoiced over the fact that the [true] God had made preparation for the people, because it was all of a sudden that the thing had occurred.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to send to all Israel and Judah, and even letters he wrote to E&acute;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">However, the king and his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem resolved to hold the passover in the second month;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">for they had not been able to hold it at that time, because not enough priests, on the one hand, had sanctified themselves and the people, on the other hand, had not gathered themselves to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the congregation.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So they decided to have the call pass through all Israel, from Be&acute;er-she&acute;ba to Dan, to come and hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem; for it was not as a multitude that they had done so according to what is written.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly the runners with the letters from the hand of the king and of his princes went throughout all Israel and Judah, even according to the commandment of the king, saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> sons of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to the escaped ones that are left of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of the palm of the kings of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And do not become like <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers and like <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers that acted unfaithfully toward Jehovah the God of their forefathers, so that he constituted them an object of astonishment, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are seeing.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Now do not stiffen <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> neck as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers did. Give place to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified to time indefinite and serve Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, that his burning anger may turn back from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> return to Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons will be objects of mercy before those holding them captive, and be allowed to return to this land; for Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God is gracious and merciful, and he will not turn away the face from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> return to him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So the runners continued on, passing along from city to city throughout the land of E&acute;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, even to Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun; but they were continually speaking in mockery of them and deriding them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Only individuals from Ash&acute;er and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and from Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun humbled themselves so that they came to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The hand of the [true] God proved to be also in Judah to give them one heart to perform the commandment of the king and the princes in the matter of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And they proceeded to gather themselves together at Jerusalem, a numerous people, to hold the festival of the unfermented cakes in the second month, a congregation very multitudinous.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars they removed and then threw [them] into the torrent valley of Kid&acute;ron.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that they slaughtered the passover victim on the fourteenth [day] of the second month; and the priests and the Levites themselves had been humiliated, so that they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And they kept standing at their place according to their rule, according to the law of Moses the man of the [true] God, the priests sprinkling the blood received from the hand of the Levites.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves; and the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the passover victims for all that were not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For there was a great number of the people, many from E&acute;phra&middot;im and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh, Is&acute;sa&middot;char and Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun, that had not cleansed themselves, for they did not eat the passover according to what is written; but Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah prayed for them, saying: “May the good Jehovah himself make allowance for</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">every one that has prepared his heart to search for the [true] God, Jehovah, the God of his forefathers, though without the purification for what is holy.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Accordingly Jehovah listened to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah and healed the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the sons of Israel that were found in Jerusalem held the festival of the unfermented cakes seven days with great rejoicing; and the Levites and the priests were offering praise to Jehovah day by day with loud instruments, even to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Moreover, Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were acting with fine discretion toward Jehovah. And they proceeded to eat the appointed feast for seven days, sacrificing communion sacrifices and making confession to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then all the congregation decided to hold it for seven more days, and so they held it for seven days with rejoicing.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah himself contributed for the congregation a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes themselves contributed for the congregation a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and priests kept sanctifying themselves in great number.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And all the congregation of Judah and the priests and the Levites and all the congregation that came from Israel and the alien residents that came from the land of Israel and those dwelling in Judah continued rejoicing.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And there came to be great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the son of David the king of Israel there was none like this in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Finally the priests, the Levites, stood up and blessed the people; and a hearing was granted to their voice, so that their prayer came to his holy dwelling, the heavens.</span>

       <span id="vs5">And as soon as the word broke forth, the sons of Israel increased the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, and oil and honey and all the produce of the field, and the tenth of everything they brought in abundantly.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the sons of Israel and of Judah that were dwelling in the cities of Judah, even they themselves [brought in] the tenth of cattle and sheep and the tenth of the holy things, the things sanctified to Jehovah their God.

       <span id="vs10">Then Az&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the chief priest of the house of Za&acute;dok said to him, yes, he said: “From the time they started to bring the contribution into the house of Jehovah there has been an eating and getting satisfied and having a surplus in abundance; for Jehovah himself has blessed his people, and what has been left over is this great plenty.”</span>

       <span id="vs12">And they kept bringing in the contribution and the tenth and the holy things in faithfulness; and Con&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the Levite was in charge of them as leader, and Shim&acute;e&middot;i his brother was second.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

       <span id="vs14">And Ko&acute;re the son of Im&acute;nah the Levite was the gatekeeper to the east, in charge of the voluntary offerings of the [true] God, to give Jehovah’s contribution and the most holy things.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And under his control there were E&acute;den and Mi&middot;ni&acute;a&middot;min and Jesh&acute;u&middot;a and She&middot;mai&acute;ah, Am&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Shec&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, in the cities of the priests, in office of trust, to give to their brothers in the divisions, equally to great and small;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">apart from their genealogical enrollment of the males from three years of age upward, of all those coming to the house of Jehovah as a daily matter of course, for their service by their obligations according to their divisions.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">This is the genealogical enrollment of the priests by the house of their fathers and also of the Levites, from the age of twenty years upward, by their obligations in their divisions;</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">both for the genealogical enrollment among all their little ones, their wives and their sons and their daughters, for all the congregation, because in their office of trust they proceeded to sanctify themselves for what was holy;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and for the sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of pasture ground of their cities.

       <span id="vs21">And in every work that he started in the service of the house of the [true] God and in the law and in the commandment to search for his God, it was with all his heart that he acted, and he proved successful.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">After these things and this faithful course Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a came and proceeded to invade Judah and camp against the fortified cities, and kept thinking of making them his by a breakthrough.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">When Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah saw that Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib had come with his face set for war against Jerusalem,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">then he decided with his princes and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; and so they helped him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Accordingly many people were collected together, and they went stopping up all the fountains and the torrent that floods through the middle of the land, saying: “Why should the kings of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a come and actually find a great deal of water?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Furthermore, he took courage and built up all the broken-down wall and raised towers upon it, and on the outside another wall, and repaired the Mound of the City of David, and made missiles in abundance and shields.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he proceeded to put military chiefs over the people and collect them to him at the public square of the gate of the city and speak to the heart of them, saying:</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people began to brace themselves upon the words of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">It was after this that Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a sent his servants to Jerusalem, while he was at La&acute;chish and all his imperial might with him, to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and to all the Ju&middot;de&acute;ans that were in Jerusalem, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“This is what Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a has said, ‘In what is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are trusting while sitting quiet under siege in Jerusalem?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Is not Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah alluring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> so as to give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> over to die by famine and by thirst, saying: “Jehovah our God himself will deliver us out of the palm of the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a”?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Is it not Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah himself that removed his high places and his altars and then said to Judah and to Jerusalem: “Before one altar <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should bow and upon it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should make sacrificial smoke”?</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not know what I myself and my forefathers did to all the peoples of the lands? Did the gods of the nations of the lands at all prove able to deliver their land out of my hand?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Who was there among all the gods of these nations that my forefathers devoted to destruction that proved able to deliver his people out of my hand, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God should be able to deliver <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of my hand?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And now do not let Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah deceive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> or allure <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> like this and do not put faith in him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my forefathers. How much less, then, will <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own God deliver <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of my hand?’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And his servants spoke yet further against Jehovah the [true] God and against Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah his servant.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Even letters he wrote to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel and to talk against him, saying: “Like the gods of the nations of the lands who did not deliver their people out of my hand, so the God of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah will not deliver his people out of my hand.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And they kept calling with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem that were upon the wall, to make them afraid and to disturb them, in order that they might capture the city.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And they went on speaking against the God of Jerusalem the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of man’s hands.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king and Isaiah the son of A&acute;moz, the prophet, kept praying over this and crying to the heavens for aid.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah proceeded to send an angel and efface every valiant, mighty man and leader and chief in the camp of the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, so that he went back with shame of face to his own land. Later on he entered the house of his god and there certain ones that had come out of his own inward parts felled him with the sword.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Thus Jehovah saved Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sen&middot;nach&acute;er&middot;ib the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a and out of the hand of all others and gave them rest all around.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And there were many bringing gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and choice things to Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah, and he came to be exalted in the eyes of all the nations after that.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In those days Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah fell sick to the point of dying, and he began to pray to Jehovah. So He talked to him, and a portent He gave him.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But according to the benefit rendered him Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah made no return, for his heart became haughty and there came to be indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">However, Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah came to have riches and glory to a very great amount; and storehouses he made for himself for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for balsam oil and for shields and for all the desirable articles;</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">and also storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil, and also stalls for all the different sorts of beasts and stalls for the droves.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And cities he acquired for himself, and also livestock of the flock and of the herd in abundance; for God gave him very many goods.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah was the one that stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gi&acute;hon and kept them directed straight along down to the west to the City of David, and Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah continued to prove successful in every work of his.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And thus it was that by the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon that were sent to him to inquire about the portent that had happened in the land, the [true] God left him to put him to the test, to get to know everything in his heart.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">As for the rest of the affairs of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah and his acts of loving-kindness, there they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of A&acute;moz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Finally Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah lay down with his forefathers, and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David; and honor was what all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem rendered to him at his death. And Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh his son began to reign in place of him.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Twelve years old was Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh when he began to reign, and for fifty-five years he reigned in Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, according to the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So he built again the high places that Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah his father had pulled down, and set up altars to the Ba&acute;als and made sacred poles, and he began to bow down to all the army of the heavens and serve them.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, respecting which Jehovah had said: “In Jerusalem my name will prove to be to time indefinite.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he went on to build altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he himself made his own sons pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom, and practiced magic and used divination and practiced sorcery and made spiritistic mediums and professional foretellers of events. He did on a grand scale what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, to offend him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Furthermore, he put the carved image that he had made in the house of the [true] God, respecting which God had said to David and to Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son: “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I shall put my name to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And I shall not remove the foot of Israel again from off the ground that I assigned to their forefathers, provided only that they take care to do all that I have commanded them concerning all the law and the regulations and the judicial decisions by the hand of Moses.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh kept seducing Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the sons of Israel.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Jehovah kept speaking to Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and his people, but they paid no attention.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Finally Jehovah brought against them the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a, and so they captured Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh in the hollows and bound him with two fetters of copper and took him to Babylon.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And as soon as it caused him distress, he softened the face of Jehovah his God and kept humbling himself greatly because of the God of his forefathers.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he kept praying to Him, so that He let himself be entreated by him and He heard his request for favor and restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship; and Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh came to know that Jehovah is the [true] God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And after this he built an outer wall for the City of David to the west of Gi&acute;hon in the torrent valley and as far as the Fish Gate, and he ran [it] around to O&acute;phel and proceeded to make it very high. Further, he put chiefs of the military force in all the fortified cities in Judah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he proceeded to remove the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of Jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem and then had them thrown outside the city.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Moreover, he prepared the altar of Jehovah and began to sacrifice upon it communion sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices and went on to say to Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Nevertheless, the people were still sacrificing upon the high places; only it was to Jehovah their God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">As for the rest of the affairs of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and his prayer to his God and the words of the visionaries that kept speaking to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, there they are among the affairs of the kings of Israel.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">As for his prayer and how his entreaty was granted him and all his sin and his unfaithfulness and the locations in which he built high places and set up the sacred poles and the graven images before he humbled himself, there they are written among the words of his visionaries.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Finally Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh lay down with his forefathers, and they buried him at his house; and A&acute;mon his son began to reign in place of him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Twenty-two years old was A&acute;mon when he began to reign, and for two years he reigned in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And he proceeded to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, just as Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh his father had done; and to all the graven images that Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh his father had made A&acute;mon sacrificed, and he continued serving them.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And he did not humble himself because of Jehovah the same as Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh his father humbled himself, for A&acute;mon was one that made guiltiness increase.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Finally his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But the people of the land struck down all the conspirators against King A&acute;mon, and the people of the land then made Jo&middot;si&acute;ah his son king in place of him.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Eight years old was Jo&middot;si&acute;ah when he began to reign, and for thirty-one years he reigned in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he proceeded to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes and walk in the ways of David his forefather; and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And in the eighth year of his reigning, while he was still a boy, he started to search for the God of David his forefather; and in the twelfth year he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the sacred poles and the graven images and the molten statues.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Further, they pulled down before him the altars of the Ba&acute;als; and the incense stands that were up above he cut down from off them; and the sacred poles and the graven images and the molten statues he broke in pieces and reduced to powder, and then sprinkled [it] upon the surface of the burial places of those that used to sacrifice to them.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the bones of priests he burned upon their altars. Thus he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Also, in the cities of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and E&acute;phra&middot;im and Sim&acute;e&middot;on and clear to Naph&acute;ta&middot;li, in their devastated places all around,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">he even went pulling down the altars and the sacred poles, and the graven images he crushed and reduced to powder; and all the incense stands he cut down in all the land of Israel, after which he returned to Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And in the eighteenth year of his reigning, when he had cleansed the land and the house, he sent Sha&acute;phan the son of Az&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah and Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the chief of the city and Jo&acute;ah the son of Jo&acute;a&middot;haz the recorder to repair the house of Jehovah his God.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And they proceeded to come to Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah the high priest and give the money that was being brought to the house of God, which the Levites the doorkeepers had gathered from the hand of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh and E&acute;phra&middot;im and from all the rest of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then they put [it] into the hand of the doers of the work that were appointed over the house of Jehovah. In turn the doers of the work who were active in the house of Jehovah applied it to mending and repairing the house.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So they gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy hewn stones and timbers for clamps and to build with beams the houses that the kings of Judah had brought to ruin.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the men were acting in faithfulness in the work; and over them there were appointed Ja&acute;hath and O&middot;ba&middot;di&acute;ah the Levites, from the sons of Me&middot;rar&acute;i, and Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Me&middot;shul&acute;lam, from the sons of the Ko&acute;hath&middot;ites, to act as overseers. And the Levites, each of whom was expert with the instruments of song,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">were over the burden bearers, and the overseers of all the doers of the work for the different services; and from the Levites there were secretaries and officers and gatekeepers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now while they were bringing out the money that was being brought to the house of Jehovah, Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah the priest found the book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah answered and said to Sha&acute;phan the secretary: “The very book of the law I have found in the house of Jehovah.” With that Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah gave the book to Sha&acute;phan.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then Sha&acute;phan brought the book to the king and replied further to the king, saying: “All that has been put in the hand of your servants they are doing.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they pour out the money that is found in the house of Jehovah and put it in the hand of the appointed men and into the hand of the doers of the work.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Sha&acute;phan the secretary went on to report to the king, saying: “There is a book that Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah the priest gave me.” And Sha&acute;phan began to read out of it before the king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And it came about that as soon as the king heard the words of the law, he immediately ripped his garments apart.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then the king commanded Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah and A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan and Ab&acute;don the son of Mi&acute;cah and Sha&acute;phan the secretary and A&middot;sai&acute;ah the king’s servant, saying:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Go, inquire of Jehovah in my own behalf and in behalf of what is left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found, for great is Jehovah’s rage that must be poured out against us because of the fact that our forefathers did not keep the word of Jehovah by doing according to all that is written in this book.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Accordingly Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah along with those whom the king [had said] went to Hul&acute;dah the prophetess, the wife of Shal&acute;lum the son of Tik&acute;vah the son of Har&acute;has the caretaker of the garments, as she was dwelling in Jerusalem in the second quarter; and they proceeded to speak to her like this.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">In turn she said to them:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs23-2">“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘S<span class="smallcaps">AY</span> to the man that sent <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to me:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am bringing calamity upon this place and its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of Judah,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">due to the fact that they have left me and gone making sacrificial smoke to other gods, in order to offend me with all the doings of their hands and that my rage may pour forth upon this place and not be extinguished.’”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And to the king of Judah, who is sending <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to inquire of Jehovah, this is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should say to him: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘As regards the words that you have heard,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">for the reason that your heart was soft so that you humbled yourself because of God at your hearing his words concerning this place and its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before me and ripped your garments apart and wept before me, I, even I, have heard, is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, and you will certainly be gathered to your graveyard in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants.’”’”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs28-2">Then they brought the reply to the king.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the king proceeded to send and gather all the older men of Judah and of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">The king now went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites and all the people, the great as well as the small; and he began to read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant, which had been found at the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the king kept standing in his place and proceeded to conclude the covenant before Jehovah to go following Jehovah and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his regulations with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Furthermore, he had all those who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to take their stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem proceeded to do according to the covenant of God, the God of their forefathers.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">After that Jo&middot;si&acute;ah removed all the detestable things out of all the lands that belonged to the sons of Israel, and he had all who were found in Israel take up service, to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they did not turn aside from following Jehovah the God of their forefathers.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Then Jo&middot;si&acute;ah held in Jerusalem a passover to Jehovah and they slaughtered the passover victim on the fourteenth day of the first month.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So he stationed the priests over the things under their care and encouraged them in the service of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he went on to say to the Levites, the instructors of all Israel, those holy to Jehovah: “Put the holy Ark in the house that Sol&acute;o&middot;mon the son of David the king of Israel built; it is not <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> as a burden upon the shoulder. Now serve Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God and his people Israel.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And make preparation by the house of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers according to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> divisions, by the writing of David the king of Israel and by the writing of Sol&acute;o&middot;mon his son.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And stand in the holy place by the classes of the house of the forefathers for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, the sons of the people, and the portion of a paternal house belonging to the Levites.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And slaughter the passover victim and sanctify yourselves and make preparation for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers to do according to the word of Jehovah by means of Moses.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Jo&middot;si&acute;ah now contributed to the sons of the people flocks, male lambs and male kids, the whole for the passover victims for all who were to be found, to the number of thirty thousand, and cattle, three thousand. These were from the goods of the king.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And his princes themselves made a contribution as a voluntary offering for the people, for the priests and for the Levites. Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah and Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Je&middot;hi&acute;el themselves as leaders of the house of the [true] God gave to the priests for the passover victims two thousand six hundred, and three hundred cattle.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Con&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah and She&middot;mai&acute;ah and Ne&middot;than&acute;el his brothers and Hash&middot;a&middot;bi&acute;ah and Je&middot;i&acute;el and Jo&acute;za&middot;bad, the chiefs of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for passover victims five thousand, and five hundred cattle.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the service was prepared and the priests kept standing at their places, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they proceeded to slaughter the passover victim and the priests sprinkled [the blood] from their hand, while the Levites were stripping the skins off.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Further, they prepared the burnt offerings so as to give them to the classes by the paternal house, to the sons of the people, so as to make a presentation to Jehovah according to what is written in the book of Moses; and thus also with the cattle.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And they went boiling the passover offering over the fire according to the custom; and the things made holy they boiled in cooking pots and in round-bottomed pots and in banquet bowls, after which they brought it quickly to all the sons of the people.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were engaged in offering up the burnt sacrifices and the fat pieces until night, and the Levites, for their part, prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the singers the sons of A&acute;saph were at their office according to the commandment of David and of A&acute;saph and of He&acute;man and of Je&middot;du&acute;thun the visionary of the king; and the gatekeepers were at the different gates. There was no need for them to turn aside from their service, because their brothers the Levites themselves prepared for them.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And all the service of Jehovah was prepared on that day to hold the passover and to offer up the burnt offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of King Jo&middot;si&acute;ah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the sons of Israel that were to be found proceeded to hold the passover at that time and also the festival of the unfermented cakes for seven days.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And there had never been held a passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet, neither had any of the other kings of Israel themselves held a passover like that which Jo&middot;si&acute;ah and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were to be found and the inhabitants of Jerusalem held.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In the eighteenth year of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah’s reign this passover was held.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">After all this when Jo&middot;si&acute;ah had prepared the house, Ne&acute;cho the king of Egypt came up to fight at Car&acute;che&middot;mish by the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes. Then Jo&middot;si&acute;ah went out to an encounter with him.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At that he sent messengers to him, saying: “What do I have to do with you, O king of Judah? It is not against you that I am coming today, but it is against another house that my fight is and that God himself said that I should cause disturbance. Refrain for your own sake because of God, who is with me, and do not let him bring you to ruin.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jo&middot;si&acute;ah did not turn his face away from him, but to fight against him he disguised himself and did not listen to the words of Ne&acute;cho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the valley plain of Me&middot;gid&acute;do.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the shooters got to shoot at King Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, so that the king said to his servants: “Take me down, for I have been very severely wounded.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Accordingly his servants took him down from the chariot and had him ride in the second war chariot that was his and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Jo&middot;si&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Jeremiah began to chant over Jo&middot;si&acute;ah; and all the male singers and female singers keep talking about Jo&middot;si&acute;ah in their dirges down till today; and they have them set as a regulation over Israel, and there they are written among the dirges.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">As for the rest of the affairs of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah and his acts of loving-kindness, according to what is written in the law of Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and his affairs, the first and the last, there they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</span>

       <span id="vs14">Even all the chiefs of the priests and the people themselves committed unfaithfulness on a large scale, according to all the detestable things of the nations, so that they defiled the house of Jehovah which he had sanctified in Jerusalem.</span>

       <span id="vs20">Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign;</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
