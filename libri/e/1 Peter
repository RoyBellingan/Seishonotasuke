       <span id="vs2">according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, with sanctification by the spirit, for the purpose of their being obedient and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">who are being safeguarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In this fact <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are greatly rejoicing, though for a little while at present, if it must be, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been grieved by various trials,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">in order that the tested quality of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> never saw him, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> love him. Though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not looking upon him at present, yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> exercise faith in him and are greatly rejoicing with an unspeakable and glorified joy,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> receive the end of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith, the salvation of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Concerning this very salvation a diligent inquiry and a careful search were made by the prophets who prophesied about the undeserved kindness meant for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">They kept on investigating what particular season or what sort of [season] the spirit in them was indicating concerning Christ when it was bearing witness beforehand about the sufferings for Christ and about the glories to follow these.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">It was revealed to them that, not to themselves, but to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, they were ministering the things that have now been announced to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> through those who have declared the good news to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with holy spirit sent forth from heaven. Into these very things angels are desiring to peer.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Hence brace up <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> minds for activity, keep <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> senses completely; set <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hope upon the undeserved kindness that is to be brought to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">As obedient children, quit being fashioned according to the desires <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> formerly had in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ignorance,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">but, in accord with the Holy One who called <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also become holy yourselves in all [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] conduct,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">because it is written: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must be holy, because I am holy.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Furthermore, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are calling upon the Father who judges impartially according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear during the time of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> alien residence.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were delivered from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">True, he was foreknown before the founding of the world, but he was made manifest at the end of the times for the sake of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span></span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">who through him are believers in God, the one who raised him up from the dead and gave him glory; so that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith and hope might be in God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Now that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have purified <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls by [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been given a new birth, not by corruptible, but by incorruptible [reproductive] seed, through the word of [the] living and enduring God.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For “all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of grass; the grass becomes withered, and the flower falls off,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">but the saying of Jehovah endures forever.” Well, this is the “saying,” this which has been declared to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as good news.</span>

       <span id="vs4">Coming to him as to a living stone, rejected, it is true, by men, but chosen, precious, with God,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5"><span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves also as living stones are being built up a spiritual house for the purpose of a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For it is contained in Scripture: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone, chosen, a foundation cornerstone, precious; and no one exercising faith in it will by any means come to disappointment.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It is to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, therefore, that he is precious, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are believers; but to those not believing, “the identical stone that the builders rejected has become [the] head of [the] corner,”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and “a stone of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense.” These are stumbling because they are disobedient to the word. To this very end they were also appointed.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should declare abroad the excellencies” of the one that called <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of darkness into his wonderful light.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were once not a people, but are now God’s people; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were those who had not been shown mercy, but are now those who have been shown mercy.</span>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Beloved, I exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as aliens and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which are the very ones that carry on a conflict against the soul.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Maintain <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> conduct fine among the nations, that, in the thing in which they are speaking against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as evildoers, they may as a result of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for [his] inspection.</span>

       <span id="vs15">For so the will of God is, that by doing good <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may muzzle the ignorant talk of the unreasonable men.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Be as free people, and yet holding <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> freedom, not as a blind for badness, but as slaves of God.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Honor [men] of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers, be in fear of God, have honor for the king.</span>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs19">For if someone, because of conscience toward God, bears up under grievous things and suffers unjustly, this is an agreeable thing.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For what merit is there in it if, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sinning and being slapped, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> endure it? But if, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing good and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> suffer, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> endure it, this is a thing agreeable with God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">In fact, to this [course] <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called, because even Christ suffered for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, leaving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a model for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to follow his steps closely.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness. And “by his stripes <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were healed.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were like sheep, going astray; but now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have returned to the shepherd and overseer of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="22">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In like manner, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wives, be in subjection to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of [their] wives,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">because of having been eyewitnesses of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> chaste conduct together with deep respect.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And do not let <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> adornment be that of the external braiding of the hair and of the putting on of gold ornaments or the wearing of outer garments,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible [apparel] of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For so, too, formerly the holy women who were hoping in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">as Sarah used to obey Abraham, calling him “lord.” And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have become her children, provided <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep on doing good and not fearing any cause for terror.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> husbands, continue dwelling in like manner with them according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life, in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> prayers not to be hindered.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Finally, all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> be like-minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">not paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling, but, to the contrary, bestowing a blessing, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called to this [course], so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> might inherit a blessing.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For, “he that would love life and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from what is bad and [his] lips from speaking deception,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">but let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For [the] eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication; but [the] face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Indeed, who is the man that will harm <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become zealous for what is good?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But even if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should suffer for the sake of righteousness, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are happy. However, the object of their fear do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> fear, neither become agitated.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">But sanctify the Christ as Lord in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a reason for the hope in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Hold a good conscience, so that in the particular in which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are spoken against they may get ashamed who are speaking slightingly of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> good conduct in connection with Christ.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For it is better to suffer because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing good, if the will of God wishes it, than because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing evil.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Why, even Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous [person] for unrighteous ones, that he might lead <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In this [state] also he went his way and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">who had once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">That which corresponds to this is also now saving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, namely, baptism, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the request made to God for a good conscience,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">He is at God’s right hand, for he went his way to heaven; and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Therefore since Christ suffered in the flesh, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition; because the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">to the end that he may live the remainder of [his] time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For the time that has passed by is sufficient for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to have worked out the will of the nations when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and illegal idolatries.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In fact, for this purpose the good news was declared also to the dead, that they might be judged as to the flesh from the standpoint of men but might live as to the spirit from the standpoint of God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But the end of all things has drawn close. Be sound in mind, therefore, and be vigilant with a view to prayers.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as it were [the] sacred pronouncements of God; if anyone ministers, [let him minister] as dependent on the strength that God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The glory and the might are his forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Beloved ones, do not be puzzled at the burning among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, which is happening to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for a trial, as though a strange thing were befalling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">On the contrary, go on rejoicing forasmuch as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are being reproached for the name of Christ, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are happy, because the [spirit] of glory, even the spirit of God, is resting upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">However, let none of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a busybody in other people’s matters.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But if [he suffers] as a Christian, let him not feel shame, but let him keep on glorifying God in this name.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. Now if it starts first with us, what will the end be of those who are not obedient to the good news of God?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“And if the righteous [man] is being saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly [man] and the sinner make a showing?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So, then, also let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on commending their souls to a faithful Creator while they are doing good.</span>
