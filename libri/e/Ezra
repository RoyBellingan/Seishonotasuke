<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Cyrus the king of Persia has said, ‘All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Whoever there is among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of all his people, may his God prove to be with him.

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then the heads of the fathers of Judah and of Benjamin and the priests and the Levites rose up, even everyone whose spirit the [true] God had roused, to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah, which was in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">As for all those round about them, they strengthened their hands with utensils of silver, with gold, with goods and with domestic animals and with choice things, besides all that which was voluntarily offered.</span>

       <span id="vs1">When the seventh month arrived the sons of Israel were in [their] cities. And the people began to gather themselves as one man to Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Jesh&acute;u&middot;a the son of Je&middot;hoz&acute;a&middot;dak and his brothers the priests and Ze&middot;rub&acute;ba&middot;bel the son of She&middot;al&acute;ti&middot;el and his brothers proceeded to rise up and build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt sacrifices upon it, according to what is written in the law of Moses the man of the [true] God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So they established the altar firmly upon its own site, for fright [came] upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah upon it, the burnt sacrifices of the morning and of the evening.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then they held the festival of booths according to what is written, with the burnt sacrifices day by day in number according to the rule of what was due each day.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And afterward there was the constant burnt offering and that for the new moons and for all the sanctified festival seasons of Jehovah and for everyone that willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">From the first day of the seventh month on they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah, when the foundation of Jehovah’s temple itself had not yet been laid.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they proceeded to give money to the cutters and to the craftsmen, and eatables and drink and oil to the Si&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;ans and the Tyr&acute;i&middot;ans, to bring cedar timbers from Leb&acute;a&middot;non to the sea at Jop&acute;pa, according to the permission granted by Cyrus the king of Persia to them.</span>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And in the second year of their coming to the house of the [true] God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Ze&middot;rub&acute;ba&middot;bel the son of She&middot;al&acute;ti&middot;el and Jesh&acute;u&middot;a the son of Je&middot;hoz&acute;a&middot;dak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem started; and they now put in positions the Levites from twenty years of age upward to act as supervisors over the work of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Accordingly Jesh&acute;u&middot;a, his sons and his brothers, [and] Kad&acute;mi&middot;el and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood up as one group to act as supervisors over the doers of the work in the house of the [true] God, [also] the sons of Hen&acute;a&middot;dad, their sons and their brothers, the Levites.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of A&acute;saph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they began to respond by praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, “for he is good, for his loving-kindness toward Israel is to time indefinite.” As for all the people, they shouted with a loud shout in praising Jehovah over the laying of the foundation of the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house, were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Hence the people were not distinguishing the sound of the shout of rejoicing from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people were shouting with a loud shout, and the sound itself was heard even to a great distance.</span>

       <span id="vs6">And in the reign of A&middot;has&middot;u&middot;e&acute;rus, at the start of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs12">let it become known to the king that the Jews who came up here from you to us have come to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and bad city, and they proceed to finish the walls and to repair the foundations.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now let it become known to the king that, if this city should be rebuilt and its walls be finished, neither tax nor tribute nor toll will they give, and it will cause loss to the treasuries of the kings.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Now inasmuch as we do eat the salt of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the denuding of the king, on this account we have sent and made [it] known to the king,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">that there may be an investigation of the book of records of your ancestors. Then you will find in the book of records and learn that that city is a city rebellious and causing loss to kings and jurisdictional districts, and within it there were movers of revolt from the days of old. For this reason that city has been laid waste.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">We are making known to the king that, if that city should be rebuilt and its walls be finished, you also will certainly have no share beyond the River.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">The king sent word to Re&acute;hum the chief government official and Shim&acute;shai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues who were dwelling in Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a and the rest beyond the River:</span>

       <span id="vs18">the official document that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have sent us has been distinctly read before me.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So an order has been put through by me, and they have investigated and found that that city has from the days of old been one rising up against kings and one in which rebellion and revolt have been carried on.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And there proved to be strong kings over Jerusalem and governing all beyond the River, and tax, tribute and toll were being given to them.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Now <span class="smallcaps">PUT</span> an order through for these able-bodied men to stop, that that city may not be rebuilt until the order is put through by me.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">So be careful that there be no negligence about acting in this regard, that the harm may not increase to the injury of kings.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Now after the copy of the official document of Ar&middot;ta&middot;xerx&acute;es the king had been read before Re&acute;hum and Shim&acute;shai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Da&middot;ri&acute;us the king of Persia.</span>

       <span id="vs9">Then we asked these older men. This is what we said to them: ‘Who put an order through to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to build this house and to finish this beam structure?’</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And we also asked them their names, so as to let you know, that we might write the names of the able-bodied men that are at their head.</span>

       <span id="vs13">Nevertheless, in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, Cyrus the king put an order through to rebuild this house of God.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And also the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;nez&acute;zar had taken out of the temple, which was in Jerusalem, and brought to the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were given to Shesh&middot;baz&acute;zar, the name of the one whom he made governor.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he said to him: “Take these vessels. Go, deposit them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt upon its place.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>

       <span id="vs15">And I proceeded to collect them at the river that comes to A&middot;ha&acute;va; and we kept encamped there three days, that I might scrutinize the people and the priests, but none of the sons of Le&acute;vi did I find there.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Accordingly I sent for E&middot;li&middot;e&acute;zer, Ar&acute;i&middot;el, She&middot;mai&acute;ah and El&middot;na&acute;than and Ja&acute;rib and El&middot;na&acute;than and Nathan and Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah and Me&middot;shul&acute;lam, head ones, and for Joi&acute;a&middot;rib and El&middot;na&acute;than, instructors.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Then I gave them a command concerning Id&acute;do the head one in the place Ca&middot;si&middot;phi&acute;a, and I put in their mouth words to speak to Id&acute;do [and] his brothers the Neth&acute;i&middot;nim in the place Ca&middot;si&middot;phi&acute;a, to bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So they brought to us, according to the good hand of our God upon us, a man of discretion from the sons of Mah&acute;li the grandson of Le&acute;vi the son of Israel, namely, She&middot;re&middot;bi&acute;ah and his sons and his brothers, eighteen;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs20">And from the Neth&acute;i&middot;nim, whom David and the princes gave to the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Neth&acute;i&middot;nim, all of whom had been designated by [their] names.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river A&middot;ha&acute;va, to humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him the right way for us and for our little ones and for all our goods.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For I felt ashamed to ask a military force and horsemen from the king to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had said to the king: “The hand of our God is over all those seeking him for good, but his strength and his anger are against all those leaving him.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Therefore we fasted and made request of our God concerning this, so that he let himself be entreated by us.</span>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">I now separated from the chiefs of the priests twelve, namely, She&middot;re&middot;bi&acute;ah, Hash&middot;a&middot;bi&acute;ah, and with them ten of their brothers.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And I proceeded to weigh out to them the silver and the gold and the utensils, the contribution to the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his princes and all the Israelites who were to be found had contributed.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Thus I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and a hundred silver utensils worth [two] talents, [and] gold a hundred talents,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and twenty small gold bowls worth a thousand darics and two utensils of good copper, gleaming red, as desirable as gold.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Then I said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are something holy to Jehovah, and the utensils are something holy, and the silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Keep awake and be on guard until <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> weigh [them] out before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the princes of the fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the dining halls of the house of Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold and the utensils, to bring [them] to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Finally we pulled away from the river A&middot;ha&acute;va on the twelfth [day] of the first month to go to Jerusalem, and the very hand of our God proved to be over us, so that he delivered us out of the palm of the enemy and the ambush by the way.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">So we came to Jerusalem and dwelt there three days.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And on the fourth day we proceeded to weigh out the silver and the gold and the utensils in the house of our God into the hand of Mer&acute;e&middot;moth the son of U&middot;ri&acute;jah the priest and with him El&middot;e&middot;a&acute;zar the son of Phin&acute;e&middot;has and with them Jo&acute;za&middot;bad the son of Jesh&acute;u&middot;a and No&middot;a&middot;di&acute;ah the son of Bin&acute;nu&middot;i the Levites,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">by number [and] by weight for everything, after which all the weight was written down at that time.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Those coming out of the captivity, the former exiles, themselves presented burnt sacrifices to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, twelve he-goats as a sin offering, everything as a burnt offering to Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Then we gave the laws of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors beyond the River, and they assisted the people and the house of the [true] God.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now as soon as Ez&acute;ra had prayed and he had made confession while weeping and lying prostrate before the house of the [true] God, those of Israel collected themselves together to him, a very large congregation, men and women and children, for the people had wept profusely.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Shec&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hi&acute;el of the sons of E&acute;lam answered and said to Ez&acute;ra: “We—we have acted unfaithfully against our God, so that we gave a dwelling to foreign wives from the peoples of the land. Yet now there exists a hope for Israel concerning this.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And now let us conclude a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and those born from them according to the counsel of Jehovah and of those trembling at the commandment of our God, that it may be done according to the law.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Get up, for the matter devolves upon you, and we are with you. Be strong and act.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">At that Ez&acute;ra rose and had the chiefs of the priests, the Levites and all Israel take an oath to do according to this word. Accordingly they took an oath.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Ez&acute;ra now rose from before the house of the [true] God and went to the dining hall of Je&middot;ho&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of E&middot;li&acute;a&middot;shib. Although he went there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiled people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then they caused a call to pass throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the former exiles to collect themselves together at Jerusalem;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and anyone that did not come in three days’ time according to the counsel of the princes and the older men—all his goods would be put under a ban and he himself be separated from the congregation of the exiled people.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So all the men of Judah and Benjamin collected themselves together at Jerusalem within three days, that is, in the ninth month on the twentieth [day] of the month, and all the people kept sitting in the open place of the house of the [true] God, shivering because of the matter and on account of the showers of rain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">At length Ez&acute;ra the priest rose and said to them: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves have acted unfaithfully in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> gave a dwelling to foreign wives so as to add to the guiltiness of Israel.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And now make confession to Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">To this all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice: “Exactly according to your word it devolves upon us to do.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">However, the people are many, and it is the season of showers of rain, and it is not possible to stand outside; and the business will not take one day or two, for we have rebelled to a great extent in this matter.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So, please, let our princes act representatively for all the congregation; and, as for all in our cities who have given a dwelling to foreign wives, let them come at the times appointed and along with them the older men of each individual city and its judges, until we have turned back the burning anger of our God from us, on account of this matter.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">(However, Jon&acute;a&middot;than the son of As&acute;a&middot;hel and Jah&middot;zei&acute;ah the son of Tik&acute;vah themselves stood up against this, and Me&middot;shul&acute;lam and Shab&acute;be&middot;thai the Levites were the ones that helped them.)</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the former exiles proceeded to do that way; and Ez&acute;ra the priest [and] the men that were the heads of the fathers for their paternal house, even all of them by [their] names, now separated themselves and began sitting on the first day of the tenth month to inquire into the matter;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and gradually they finished with all the men that had given a dwelling to foreign wives by the first day of the first month.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And some of the sons of the priests came to be found that had given a dwelling to foreign wives; of the sons of Jesh&acute;u&middot;a the son of Je&middot;hoz&acute;a&middot;dak and his brothers, Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah and E&middot;li&middot;e&acute;zer and Ja&acute;rib and Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
