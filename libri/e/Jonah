<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="17">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the word of Jehovah began to occur to Jo&acute;nah the son of A&middot;mit&acute;tai, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Get up, go to Nin&acute;e&middot;veh the great city, and proclaim against her that their badness has come up before me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Jo&acute;nah proceeded to get up and run away to Tar&acute;shish from before Jehovah; and he finally came down to Jop&acute;pa and found a ship going to Tar&acute;shish. So he paid its fare and went down into it, in order to go with them to Tar&acute;shish from before Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jehovah himself hurled forth a great wind at the sea, and there came to be a great tempest on the sea; and as for the ship, it was about to be wrecked.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the mariners began to fear and to call for aid, each one to his god. And they kept hurling out the articles that were in the ship to the sea, in order to lighten [it] of them. But Jo&acute;nah himself had gone down to the innermost parts of the decked vessel, and he proceeded to lie down and go fast asleep.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At length the ship captain came near to him and said to him: “What is the matter with you, sleeper? Get up, call out to your god! Perhaps the [true] God will show himself caring about us, and we shall not perish.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they began to say to one another: “Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account we have this calamity.” And they kept casting lots, and finally the lot fell upon Jo&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So they said to him: “Do tell us, please, on whose account it is that we are having this calamity? What is your work, and from where do you come? What is your country, and from which people are you?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At that he said to them: “I am a Hebrew, and Jehovah the God of the heavens I am fearing, the One who made the sea and the dry land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the men began to fear greatly, and they went on to say to him: “What is this that you have done?” For the men had come to know that it was from before Jehovah that he was running away, because he had told them.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Finally they said to him: “What should we do to you, in order that the sea may become still for us?” For the sea was continually growing more tempestuous.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So he said to them: “Lift me up and hurl me into the sea, and the sea will become still for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; because I am aware that it is on my account that this great tempest is upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But the men tried to work their way through, in order to bring [the ship] back to the dry land; yet they were unable, because the sea was continually growing more tempestuous against them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they proceeded to call out to Jehovah and to say: “Ah, now, O Jehovah, may we, please, not perish because of the soul of this man! And do not put upon us innocent blood, since you yourself, O Jehovah, have done according to what you have delighted in!”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then they lifted up Jo&acute;nah and hurled him into the sea; and the sea began to halt from its raging.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that the men began to fear Jehovah greatly, and so they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah and made vows.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Now Jehovah appointed a great fish to swallow Jo&acute;nah, so that Jo&acute;nah came to be in the inward parts of the fish three days and three nights.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">To Jo&acute;nah, though, it was highly displeasing, and he got to be hot with anger.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Hence he prayed to Jehovah and said: “Ah, now, O Jehovah, was not this an affair of mine, while I happened to be on my own ground? That is why I went ahead and ran away to Tar&acute;shish; for I knew that you are a God gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, and feeling regret over the calamity.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And now, O Jehovah, take away, please, my soul from me, for my dying is better than my being alive.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In turn Jehovah said: “Have you rightly become hot with anger?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Jo&acute;nah went out of the city and sat down east of the city; and gradually he made for himself there a booth, that he might sit under it in the shade until he would see what would become of the city.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly Jehovah God appointed a bottle-gourd plant, that it should come up over Jo&acute;nah, in order to become a shade over his head, to deliver him from his calamitous state. And Jo&acute;nah began to rejoice greatly over the bottle-gourd plant.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But the [true] God appointed a worm at the ascending of the dawn on the next day, that it should strike the bottle-gourd plant; and it gradually dried up.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it came about that, as soon as the sun shone forth, God also went on to appoint a parching east wind, and the sun kept striking upon the head of Jo&acute;nah, so that he was swooning away; and he kept asking that his soul might die, and he repeatedly said: “My dying off is better than my being alive.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And God proceeded to say to Jo&acute;nah: “Have you rightly become hot with anger over the bottle-gourd plant?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs9-2">At that he said: “I have rightly become hot with anger, to the point of death.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But Jehovah said: “You, for your part, felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, which you did not toil upon or make get big, which proved to be a mere growth of a night and perished as a mere growth of a night.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And, for my part, ought I not to feel sorry for Nin&acute;e&middot;veh the great city, in which there exist more than one hundred and twenty thousand men who do not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left, besides many domestic animals?”</span>
