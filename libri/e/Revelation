       <span id="vs1">And the fifth angel blew his trumpet. And I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key of the pit of the abyss was given him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened, also the air, by the smoke of the pit.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And out of the smoke locusts came forth upon the earth; and authority was given them, the same authority as the scorpions of the earth have.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And they were told to harm no vegetation of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it was granted the [locusts], not to kill them, but that these should be tormented five months, and the torment upon them was as torment by a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And in those days the men will seek death but will by no means find it, and they will desire to die but death keeps fleeing from them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads [were] what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces [were] as men’s faces,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is A&middot;bad&acute;don, but in Greek he has the name A&middot;pol&acute;lyon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The one woe is past. Look! Two more woes are coming after these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the sixth angel blew his trumpet. And I heard one voice out of the horns of the golden altar that is before God</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">say to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet: “Untie the four angels that are bound at the great river Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the four angels were untied, who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, to kill a third of the men.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And this is how I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them: they had fire-red and hyacinth-blue and sulphur-yellow breastplates; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths fire and smoke and sulphur issued forth.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">By these three plagues a third of the men were killed, from the fire and the smoke and the sulphur which issued forth from their mouths.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with these they do harm.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they should not worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and they did not repent of their murders nor of their spiritistic practices nor of their fornication nor of their thefts.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and she was pregnant. And she cries out in her pains and in her agony to give birth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And another sign was seen in heaven, and, look! a great fiery-colored dragon, with seven heads and ten horns and upon its heads seven diadems;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and its tail drags a third of the stars of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth. And the dragon kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth, that, when she did give birth, it might devour her child.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And war broke out in heaven: Mi&acute;cha&middot;el and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And I heard a loud voice in heaven say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs10-2">“Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God!</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing, and they did not love their souls even in the face of death.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">On this account be glad, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heavens and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Now when the dragon saw that it was hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the woman that gave birth to the male child.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But the two wings of the great eagle were given the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place; there is where she is fed for a time and times and half a time away from the face of the serpent.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the serpent disgorged water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But the earth came to the woman’s help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon disgorged from its mouth.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.</span>

</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-2">And I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and upon its horns ten diadems, but upon its heads blasphemous names.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were as those of a bear, and its mouth was as a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave to [the beast] its power and its throne and great authority.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And I saw one of its heads as though slaughtered to death, but its death-stroke got healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And they worshiped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshiped the wild beast with the words: “Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given it, and authority to act forty-two months was given it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his residence, even those residing in heaven.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And there was granted it to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And all those who dwell on the earth will worship it; the name of not one of them stands written in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered, from the founding of the world.</span>

       <span id="vs10">If anyone [is meant] for captivity, he goes away into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is where it means the endurance and faith of the holy ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking as a dragon.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And it exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight. And it makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first wild beast, whose death-stroke got healed.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it performs great signs, so that it should even make fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind.</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And it misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that were granted it to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And there was granted it to give breath to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who would not in any way worship the image of the wild beast.</span>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it puts under compulsion all persons, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that they should give these a mark in their right hand or upon their forehead,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">and that nobody might be able to buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Here is where wisdom comes in: Let the one that has intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number; and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</span>

       <span id="vs2">And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to master that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought from the earth.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes.

       <span id="vs5">and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.</span>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs7">saying in a loud voice: “F<span class="smallcaps">EAR</span> God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.”</span>

       <span id="vs10">he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs16">And the one seated on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And still another angel emerged from the temple [sanctuary] that is in heaven, he, too, having a sharp sickle.</span>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And still another angel emerged from the altar and he had authority over the fire.

       <span id="vs19">And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of the anger of God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses, for a distance of a thousand six hundred furlongs.</span>

       <span id="vs18">And lightnings and voices and thunders occurred, and a great earthquake occurred such as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive an earthquake, so great.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the Great was remembered in the sight of God, to give her the cup of the wine of the anger of his wrath.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>

       <span id="vs1">And one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: “Come, I will show you the judgment upon the great harlot who sits on many waters,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, whereas those who inhabit the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he carried me away in [the power of the] spirit into a wilderness. And I caught sight of a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and was adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls and had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her fornication.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs6-2">Well, on catching sight of her I wondered with great wonderment.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And so the angel said to me: “Why is it you wondered? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns:</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss, and it is to go off into destruction. And when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present, those who dwell on the earth will wonder admiringly, but their names have not been written upon the scroll of life from the founding of the world.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Here is where the intelligence that has wisdom comes in: The seven heads mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet arrived, but when he does arrive he must remain a short while.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also itself an eighth [king], but springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“And the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">These have one thought, and so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">These will battle with the Lamb, but, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those called and chosen and faithful with him [will do so].”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And he says to me: “The waters that you saw, where the harlot is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For God put [it] into their hearts to carry out his thought, even to carry out [their] one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, until the words of God will have been accomplished.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>

       <span id="vs1">After these things I saw another angel descending from heaven, with great authority; and the earth was lighted up from his glory.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a lurking place of every unclean exhalation and a lurking place of every unclean and hated bird!</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For because of the wine of the anger of her fornication all the nations have fallen [victim], and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the traveling merchants of the earth became rich due to the power of her shameless luxury.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not want to share with her in her sins, and if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not want to receive part of her plagues.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Render to her even as she herself rendered, and do to her twice as much, yes, twice the number of the things she did; in the cup in which she put a mixture put twice as much of the mixture for her.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her, when they look at the smoke from the burning of her,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">while they stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say, ‘Too bad, too bad, you great city, Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Also, the traveling merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full stock anymore,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">a full stock of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet; and everything in scented wood and every sort of ivory object and every sort of object out of most precious wood and of copper and of iron and of marble;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">also cinnamon and Indian spice and incense and perfumed oil and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and horses and coaches and slaves and human souls.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Yes, the fine fruit that your soul desired has departed from you, and all the dainty things and the gorgeous things have perished from you, and never again will people find them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“The traveling merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of [their] fear of her torment and will weep and mourn,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">saying, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet, and richly adorned with gold ornament and precious stone and pearl,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs17-2">“And every ship captain and every man that voyages anywhere, and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea, stood at a distance</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and cried out as they looked at the smoke from the burning of her and said, ‘What city is like the great city?’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And they threw dust upon their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, in which all those having boats at sea became rich by reason of her costliness, because in one hour she has been devastated!’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“Be glad over her, O heaven, also <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> holy ones and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> apostles and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> prophets, because God has judicially exacted punishment for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from her!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp and of musicians and of flutists and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again, and no craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and no light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; because your traveling merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, for by your spiritistic practice all the nations were misled.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">After these things I heard what was as a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment upon the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves at her hand.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God seated upon the throne, and said: “Amen! Praise Jah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Also, a voice issued forth from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Yes, it has been granted to her to be arrayed in bright, clean, fine linen, for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he tells me: “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus. Worship God; for the bearing witness to Jesus is what inspires prophesying.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">His eyes are a fiery flame, and upon his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and he is arrayed with an outer garment sprinkled with blood, and the name he is called is The Word of God.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And out of his mouth there protrudes a sharp long sword, that he may strike the nations with it, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. He treads too the winepress of the anger of the wrath of God the Almighty.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And upon his outer garment, even upon his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may eat the fleshy parts of kings and the fleshy parts of military commanders and the fleshy parts of strong men and the fleshy parts of horses and of those seated upon them, and the fleshy parts of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage the war with the one seated on the horse and with his army.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who render worship to its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulphur.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But the rest were killed off with the long sword of the one seated on the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth. And all the birds were filled from the fleshy parts of them.</span>

       <span id="vs6">Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now as soon as the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Ma&acute;gog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And they advanced over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and devoured them.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet [already were]; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I saw a great white throne and the one seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Ha&acute;des gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And death and Ha&acute;des were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">I saw also the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the One seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new.” Also, he says: “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And he said to me: “They have come to pass! I am the Al&acute;pha and the O&middot;me&acute;ga, the beginning and the end. To anyone thirsting I will give from the fountain of the water of life free.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God and he will be my son.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and fornicators and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur. This means the second death.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls which were full of the seven last plagues, and he spoke with me and said: “Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So he carried me away in [the power of the] spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone shining crystal-clear.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">It had a great and lofty wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">The wall of the city also had twelve foundation stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Now the one who was speaking with me was holding as a measure a golden reed, that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; its length and breadth and height are equal.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Also, he measured its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now the structure of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chal&middot;ced&acute;o&middot;ny, the fourth emerald,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">the fifth sar&acute;do&middot;nyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrys&acute;o&middot;lite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrys&acute;o&middot;prase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Also, the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. And the broad way of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And I did not see a temple in it, for Jehovah God the Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb [is].</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God lighted it up, and its lamp was the Lamb.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the nations will walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">But anything not sacred and anyone that carries on a disgusting thing and a lie will in no way enter into it; only those written in the Lamb’s scroll of life [will].</span>
