</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by an accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">forasmuch as his divine power has given us freely all the things that concern life and godly devotion, through the accurate knowledge of the one who called us through glory and virtue.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Through these things he has freely given us the precious and very grand promises, that through these <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may become sharers in divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Yes, for this very reason, by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> contributing in response all earnest effort, supply to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith virtue, to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] virtue knowledge,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] knowledge self-control, to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] self-control endurance, to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] endurance godly devotion,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] godly devotion brotherly affection, to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] brotherly affection love.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For if these things exist in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and overflow, they will prevent <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For if these things are not present in anyone, he is blind, shutting his eyes [to the light], and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For this reason, brothers, all the more do <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> utmost to make the calling and choosing of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sure for yourselves; for if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep on doing these things <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will by no means ever fail.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In fact, thus there will be richly supplied to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this reason I shall be disposed always to remind <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of these things, although <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know [them] and are firmly set in the truth that is present [in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>].</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to rouse <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up by way of reminding <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">knowing as I do that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon to be, just as also our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So I will do my utmost also at every time that, after my departure, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be able to make mention of these things for yourselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we acquainted <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but it was by having become eyewitnesses of his magnificence.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when words such as these were borne to him by the magnificent glory: “This is my son, my beloved, whom I myself have approved.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Yes, these words we heard borne from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Consequently we have the prophetic word [made] more sure; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.</span>

       <span id="vs1">However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Furthermore, many will follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account of these the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Also, with covetousness they will exploit <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with counterfeit words. But as for them, the judgment from of old is not moving slowly, and the destruction of them is not slumbering.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Certainly if God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tar&acute;ta&middot;rus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and he did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">and by reducing the cities Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come;</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and he delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the indulgence of the law-defying people in loose conduct—</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">for that righteous man by what he saw and heard while dwelling among them from day to day was tormenting his righteous soul by reason of their lawless deeds—</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">especially, however, those who go on after flesh with the desire to defile [it] and who look down on lordship.</span>

       <span id="vs12">But these [men], like unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed, will, in the things of which they are ignorant and speak abusively, even suffer destruction in their own [course of] destruction,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">wronging themselves as a reward for wrongdoing.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs13-2">They consider luxurious living in the daytime a pleasure. They are spots and blemishes, indulging with unrestrained delight in their deceptive teachings while feasting together with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">They have eyes full of adultery and unable to desist from sin, and they entice unsteady souls. They have a heart trained in covetousness. They are accursed children.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Abandoning the straight path, they have been misled. They have followed the path of Ba&acute;laam, [the son] of Be&acute;or, who loved the reward of wrongdoing,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">but got a reproof for his own violation of what was right. A voiceless beast of burden, making utterance with the voice of a man, hindered the prophet’s mad course.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">These are fountains without water, and mists driven by a violent storm, and for them the blackness of darkness has been reserved.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For they utter swelling expressions of no profit, and by the desires of the flesh and by loose habits they entice those who are just escaping from people who conduct themselves in error.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are existing as slaves of corruption. For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: “The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.”</span>

       <span id="vs9">Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Yet Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a hissing noise, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be discovered.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which [the] heavens being on fire will be dissolved and [the] elements being intensely hot will melt!</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Hence, beloved ones, since <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are awaiting these things, do <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given him also wrote <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">speaking about these things as he does also in all [his] letters. In them, however, are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unsteady are twisting, as [they do] also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> guard that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people and fall from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own steadfastness.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him [be] the glory both now and to the day of eternity.</span>
