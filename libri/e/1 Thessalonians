<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">To be sure, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves know, brothers, how our visit to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> has not been without results,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">but how, after we had first suffered and been insolently treated (just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know) in Phi&middot;lip&acute;pi, we mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the good news of God with a great deal of struggling.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For the exhortation we give does not arise from error or from uncleanness or with deceit,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">but, just as we have been proved by God as fit to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, as pleasing, not men, but God, who makes proof of our hearts.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In fact, at no time have we turned up either with flattering speech, (just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know) or with a false front for covetousness, God is witness!</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Neither have we been seeking glory from men, no, either from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> or from others, though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">To the contrary, we became gentle in the midst of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, as when a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So, having a tender affection for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, we were well pleased to impart to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> became beloved to us.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Certainly <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> bear in mind, brothers, our labor and toil. It was with working night and day, so as not to put an expensive burden upon any one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that we preached the good news of God to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are witnesses, God is also, how loyal and righteous and unblamable we proved to be to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believers.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In harmony with that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> well know how, as a father does his children, we kept exhorting each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and consoling and bearing witness to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">to the end that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should go on walking worthily of God who is calling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to his kingdom and glory.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Indeed, that is why we also thank God incessantly, because when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received God’s word, which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard from us, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> believers.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> became imitators, brothers, of the congregations of God that are in Ju&middot;de&acute;a in union with Christ Jesus, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> also began suffering at the hands of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own countrymen the same things as they also [are suffering] at the hands of the Jews,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">who killed even the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us. Furthermore, they are not pleasing God, but are against [the interests of] all men,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">as they try to hinder us from speaking to people of the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But his wrath has at length come upon them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As for ourselves, brothers, when we were bereaved of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for but a short time, in person, not in heart, we endeavored far more than is usual to see <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faces with great desire.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For this reason we wanted to come to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, yes, I Paul, both once and a second time, but Satan cut across our path.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> certainly are our glory and joy.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Finally, brothers, we request <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by the Lord Jesus, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> received [the instruction] from us on how <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ought to walk and please God, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in fact walking, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> would keep on doing it more fully.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know the orders we gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> through the Lord Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For this is what God wills, the sanctifying of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> abstain from fornication;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">that each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should know how to get possession of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">not in covetous sexual appetite such as also those nations have which do not know God;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">that no one go to the point of harming and encroach upon the rights of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah is one who exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> beforehand and also gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a thorough witness.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So, then, the man that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">However, with reference to brotherly love, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not need us to be writing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves are taught by God to love one another;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and, in fact, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing it to all the brothers in all of Mac&middot;e&middot;do&acute;ni&middot;a. But we exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, brothers, to go on doing it in fuller measure,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and to make it <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> aim to live quietly and to mind <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own business and work with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands, just as we ordered <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be walking decently as regards people outside and not be needing anything.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Moreover, brothers, we do not want <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping [in death]; that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For if our faith is that Jesus died and rose again, so, too, those who have fallen asleep [in death] through Jesus God will bring with him.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For this is what we tell <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> by Jehovah’s word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep [in death];</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with [the] Lord.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Consequently keep comforting one another with these words.</span>
