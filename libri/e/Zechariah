       <span id="vs2">“Jehovah grew indignant at <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers—very much so.</span>
</p>

<p>

       <span id="vs7">On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, that is, the month She&acute;bat, in the second year of Da&middot;ri&acute;us, the word of Jehovah occurred to Zech&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Ber&middot;e&middot;chi&acute;ah the son of Id&acute;do the prophet, saying:</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“I saw [in] the night, and, look! a man riding on a red horse, and he was standing still among the myrtle trees that were in the deep place; and behind him there were horses red, bright red, and white.”</span>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And so I said: “Who are these, my lord?”</span>

<p> 
       <span id="vs9-2">At that the angel who was speaking with me said to me: “I myself shall show you who these very ones are.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then the man who was standing still among the myrtle trees answered and said: “These are the ones whom Jehovah has sent forth to walk about in the earth.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they proceeded to answer the angel of Jehovah who was standing among the myrtle trees and to say: “We have walked about in the earth, and, look! the whole earth is sitting still and having no disturbance.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So the angel of Jehovah answered and said: “O Jehovah of armies, how long will you yourself not show mercy to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah, whom you have denounced these seventy years?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jehovah proceeded to answer the angel who was speaking with me, with good words, comforting words;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and the angel who was speaking with me went on to say to me: “Call out, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">With great indignation I am feeling indignant against the nations that are at ease; because I, for my part, felt indignant to only a little extent, but they, for their part, helped toward calamity.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘“I shall certainly return to Jerusalem with mercies. My own house will be built in her,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, “and a measuring line itself will be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Call out further, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “My cities will yet overflow with goodness; and Jehovah will yet certainly feel regrets over Zion and yet actually choose Jerusalem.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I proceeded to raise my eyes and see; and, look! there were four horns.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So I said to the angel who was speaking with me: “What are these?” In turn he said to me: “These are the horns that dispersed Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”</span>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Furthermore, Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At that I said: “What are these coming to do?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs21-2">And he went on to say: “These are the horns that dispersed Judah to such an extent that no one at all raised his head; and these others will come to set them trembling, to cast down the horns of the nations that are lifting up a horn against the land of Judah, in order to disperse her.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">Howl, O juniper tree, for the cedar has fallen; because the majestic ones themselves have been despoiled! Howl, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> massive trees of Ba&acute;shan, for the impenetrable forest has come down!</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Listen! The howling of shepherds, for their majesty has been despoiled. Listen! The roaring of maned young lions, for the proud [thickets] along the Jordan have been despoiled.</span>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘For I shall show compassion no more upon the inhabitants of the land,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘So here I am causing mankind to find themselves, each one in the hand of his companion and in the hand of his king; and they will certainly crush to pieces the land, and I shall do no delivering out of their hand.’”</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Take yet for yourself the implements of a useless shepherd.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For here I am letting a shepherd rise up in the land. To the [sheep] being effaced he will give no attention.

       <span id="vs1">A pronouncement:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-2">“The word of Jehovah concerning Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah, the One who is stretching out [the] heavens and laying the foundation of [the] earth and forming the spirit of man inside him.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Here I am making Jerusalem a bowl [causing] reeling to all the peoples round about; and also against Judah he will come to be in the siege, [even] against Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it must occur in that day [that] I shall make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples. All those lifting it will without fail get severe scratches for themselves; and against her all the nations of the earth will certainly be gathered.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “I shall strike every horse with bewilderment and its rider with madness; and upon the house of Judah I shall open my eyes, and every horse of the peoples I shall strike with loss of sight.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the sheiks of Judah will have to say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to me by Jehovah of armies their God.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In that day I shall make the sheiks of Judah like a firepot among trees and like a fiery torch in a row of newly cut grain, and they must devour on the right [hand] and on the left all the peoples round about; and Jerusalem must yet be inhabited in her [own] place, in Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“And Jehovah will certainly save the tents of Judah first, to the end that the beauty of the house of David and the beauty of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not become too great over Judah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In that day Jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the one that is stumbling among them must become in that day like David, and the house of David like God, like Jehovah’s angel before them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And it must occur in that day [that] I shall seek to annihilate all the nations that are coming against Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of favor and entreaties, and they will certainly look to the One whom they pierced through, and they will certainly wail over Him as in the wailing over an only [son]; and there will be a bitter lamentation over him as when there is bitter lamentation over the firstborn [son].</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In that day the wailing in Jerusalem will be great, like the wailing of Ha&middot;dad&middot;rim&acute;mon in the valley plain of Me&middot;gid&acute;do.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the land will certainly wail, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their women by themselves;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">the family of the house of Le&acute;vi by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the Shim&acute;e&middot;ites by itself, and their women by themselves;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">all the families that are left remaining, each family by itself, and their women by themselves.</span>
