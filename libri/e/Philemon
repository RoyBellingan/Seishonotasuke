       <span id="vs1">Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, [our] brother, to Phi&middot;le&acute;mon, our beloved one and fellow worker,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and to Ap&acute;phi&middot;a, our sister, and to Ar&middot;chip&acute;pus, our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">I always thank my God when I make mention of you in my prayers,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">as I keep hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy ones;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">in order that the sharing of your faith may go into action by your acknowledging of every good thing among us as related to Christ.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For I got much joy and comfort over your love, because the tender affections of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">I am exhorting you rather on the basis of love, seeing that I am such as I am, Paul an aged man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">I am exhorting you concerning my child, to whom I became a father while in my [prison] bonds, O&middot;nes&acute;i&middot;mus,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">formerly useless to you but now useful to you and to me.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">This very one I am sending back to you, yes, him, that is, my own tender affections.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">I would like to hold him back for myself that in place of you he might keep on ministering to me in the [prison] bonds I bear for the sake of the good news.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But without your consent I do not want to do anything, so that your good act may be, not as under compulsion, but of your own free will.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Perhaps really on this account he broke away for an hour, that you may have him back forever,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">no longer as a slave but as more than a slave, as a brother beloved, especially so to me, yet how much more so to you both in fleshly relationship and in [the] Lord.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">If, therefore, you consider me a sharer, receive him kindly the way you would me.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, keep this charged to my account.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">I Paul am writing with my own hand: I will pay it backâ€”not to be telling you that, besides, you owe me even yourself.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Yes, brother, may I derive profit from you in connection with [the] Lord: refresh my tender affections in connection with Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Trusting in your compliance, I am writing you, knowing you will even do more than the things I say.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But along with that, also get lodging ready for me, for I am hoping that through the prayers of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people I shall be set at liberty for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Sending you greetings is Ep&acute;a&middot;phras my fellow captive in union with Christ,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">[also] Mark, Ar&middot;is&middot;tar&acute;chus, De&acute;mas, Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
