       <span id="vs1">A pronouncement:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-2">The word of Jehovah concerning Israel by means of Mal&acute;a&middot;chi:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“I have loved <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people,” Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have said: “In what way have you loved us?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-3">“Was not E&acute;sau the brother of Jacob?” is the utterance of Jehovah. “But I loved Jacob,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and E&acute;sau I have hated; and I finally made his mountains a desolated waste and his inheritance for the jackals of [the] wilderness.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Because E&acute;dom keeps saying, ‘We have been shattered, but we shall return and build [the] devastated places,’ this is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘They, for their part, will build; but I, for my part, shall tear down. And people will certainly call them “the territory of wickedness” and “the people whom Jehovah has denounced to time indefinite.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own eyes will see [it], and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will say: “May Jehovah be magnified over the territory of Israel.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘A son, for his part, honors a father; and a servant, his grand master. So if I am a father, where is the honor to me? And if I am a grand master, where is the fear of me?’ Jehovah of armies has said to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, O priests who are despising my name.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs6-2">“‘And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have said: “In what way have we despised your name?”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘[By] presenting upon my altar polluted bread.’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs7-2">“‘And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have said: “In what way have we polluted you?”’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs7-3">“‘By <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> saying: “The table of Jehovah is something to be despised.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> present a blind [animal] for sacrificing: “It is nothing bad.” And when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> present a lame [animal] or a sick one: “It is nothing bad.”’”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs8-2">“Bring it near, please, to your governor. Will he find pleasure in you, or will he receive you kindly?” Jehovah of armies has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“And now, please, soften the face of God, that he may show us favor. From <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand this has occurred. Will he receive any of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men kindly?” Jehovah of armies has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Who also is there among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that will shut the doors? And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men will not light my altar—for nothing. No delight do I have in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,” Jehovah of armies has said, “and in the gift offering from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand I take no pleasure.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“For from the sun’s rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place sacrificial smoke will be made, a presentation will be made to my name, even a clean gift; because my name will be great among the nations,” Jehovah of armies has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are profaning me by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> saying, ‘The table of Jehovah is something polluted, and its fruit is something to be despised, its food.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have said, ‘Look! What a weariness!’ and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have caused a sniffing at it,” Jehovah of armies has said. “And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have brought something torn away, and the lame one, and the sick one; yes, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have brought [it] as a gift. Can I take pleasure in it at <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand?” Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And cursed is the one acting cunningly when there exists in his drove a male animal, and he is making a vow and sacrificing a ruined one to Jehovah. For I am a great King,” Jehovah of armies has said, “and my name will be fear-inspiring among the nations.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">“And now this commandment is to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, O priests.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not listen, and if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not lay [it] to heart to give glory to my name,” Jehovah of armies has said, “I shall also certainly send upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the curse, and I will curse <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> blessings. Yes, I have even cursed the [blessing], because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not laying [it] to heart.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“Look!

       <span id="vs4">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to know that I have sent to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> this commandment, in order that my covenant with Le&acute;vi may continue,” Jehovah of armies has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“As for my covenant, it proved to be with him, [one] of life and of peace, and I kept giving them to him, with fear. And he continued fearing me; yes, because of my name he himself was struck with terror.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">The very law of truth proved to be in his mouth, and there was no unrighteousness to be found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness he walked with me, and many were those whom he turned back from error.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For the lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and [the] law is what people should seek from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of armies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men—<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have turned aside from the way.

       <span id="vs9">“And I also, for my part, shall certainly make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to be despised and low to all the people, according as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were not keeping my ways, but were showing partiality in the law.”</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs10">“Is it not one father that all of us have? Is it not one God that has created us? Why is it that we deal treacherously with one another, in profaning the covenant of our forefathers?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Judah has dealt treacherously, and a detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He has loved, and he has taken possession of the daughter of a foreign god as a bride.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Jehovah will cut off each one that does it, one who is awake and one who is answering, from the tents of Jacob, and one who is presenting a gift offering to Jehovah of armies.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“And this is the second thing that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people do, [this resulting in] covering with tears the altar of Jehovah, with weeping and sighing, so that there is no more a turning toward the gift offering or a taking of pleasure [in anything] from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have said, ‘On what account?’ On this account, that Jehovah himself has borne witness between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you yourself have dealt treacherously, although she is your partner and the wife of your covenant.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And there was one who did not do [it], as he had what was remaining of [the] spirit. And what was that one seeking? The seed of God. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people must guard yourselves respecting <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> spirit, and with the wife of your youth may no one deal treacherously.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For he has hated a divorcing,” Jehovah the God of Israel has said; “and the one who with violence has covered over his garment,” Jehovah of armies has said. “And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must guard yourselves respecting <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> spirit, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not deal treacherously.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
