       <span id="vs2">And it occurred that when it had finished eating up the vegetation of the land, I proceeded to say: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, forgive, please. Who will rise up of Jacob? For he is small!”</span>

       <span id="vs16">And now hear the word of Jehovah, ‘Are you saying: “You must not prophesy against Israel, and you must let no [word] drop against the house of Isaac”?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “As regards your wife, in the city she will become a prostitute.

       <span id="vs1">I saw Jehovah stationed above the altar, and he proceeded to say: “Strike the pillar head, so that the thresholds will rock. And cut them off at the head, all of them. And the last part of them I shall kill with the sword itself. No one fleeing of them will make good his flight, and no one escaping of them will make his getaway.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">If they dig down into She&acute;ol, from there my own hand will take them; and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And if they hide themselves on the top of Car&acute;mel, from there I shall carefully search and be certain to take them. And if they conceal themselves from in front of my eyes on the floor of the sea, down there I shall command the serpent, and it must bite them.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And if they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I shall command the sword, and it must kill them; and I will set my eyes upon them for bad, and not for good.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of the armies, is the One touching the land, so that it melts; and all the inhabitants in it will have to mourn; and it will certainly come up like the Nile, all of it, and sink down like the Nile of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘He who is building in the heavens his stairs, and his structure over the earth that he founded; he who is calling for the waters of the sea, that he may pour them out upon the surface of the earth—Jehovah is his name.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘Are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not like the sons of the Cush&acute;ites to me, O sons of Israel?’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘Did I not bring Israel itself up out of the land of Egypt, and the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines out of Crete, and Syria out of Kir?’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘Look! The eyes of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and he will certainly annihilate it from upon the surface of the ground. Nevertheless, I shall not completely annihilate the house of Jacob,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">‘For, look! I am commanding, and I will jiggle the house of Israel among all the nations, just as one jiggles the sieve, so that not a pebble falls to the earth.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">By the sword they will die—all the sinners of my people, those who are saying: “The calamity will not come near or reach as far as us.”’</span>

       <span id="vs11">“‘In that day I shall raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and I shall certainly repair their breaches. And its ruins I shall raise up, and I shall certainly build it up as in the days of long ago,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">to the end that they may take possession of what is left remaining of E&acute;dom, and all the nations upon whom my name has been called,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, who is doing this.</span>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“‘Look! There are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and the plowman will actually overtake the harvester, and the treader of grapes, the carrier of the seed; and the mountains must drip with sweet wine, and the very hills will all find themselves melting.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And I will gather back the captive ones of my people Israel, and they will actually build [the] desolated cities and inhabit [them], and plant vineyards and drink the wine of them, and make gardens and eat the fruit of them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“‘And I shall certainly plant them upon their ground, and they will no more be uprooted from their ground that I have given them,’ Jehovah your God has said.”</span>
