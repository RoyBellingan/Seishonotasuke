       <span id="vs3">For I rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness to the truth you hold, just as you go on walking in the truth.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">No greater cause for thankfulness do I have than these things, that I should be hearing that my children go on walking in the truth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Beloved one, you are doing a faithful work in whatever you do for the brothers, and strangers at that,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">who have borne witness to your love before the congregation. These you will please send on their way in a manner worthy of God.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For it was in behalf of [his] name that they went forth, not taking anything from the people of the nations.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">We, therefore, are under obligation to receive such persons hospitably, that we may become fellow workers in the truth.</span>

       <span id="vs10">That is why, if I come, I will call to remembrance his works which he goes on doing, chattering about us with wicked words. Also, not being content with these things, neither does he himself receive the brothers with respect, and those who are wanting to receive them he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Beloved one, be an imitator, not of what is bad, but of what is good. He that does good originates with God. He that does bad has not seen God.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">De&middot;me&acute;tri&middot;us has had witness borne to him by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we, also, are bearing witness, and you know that the witness we give is true.</span>
