<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="40">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="22">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt with Jacob; each man and his household came:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Reu&acute;ben, Sim&acute;e&middot;on, Le&acute;vi and Judah,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Is&acute;sa&middot;char, Zeb&acute;u&middot;lun and Benjamin,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Dan and Naph&acute;ta&middot;li, Gad and Ash&acute;er.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And all the souls who issued out of Jacob’s upper thigh came to be seventy souls, but Joseph was already in Egypt.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Eventually Joseph died, and also all his brothers and all that generation.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the sons of Israel became fruitful and began to swarm; and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at a very extraordinary rate, so that the land got to be filled with them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In time there arose over Egypt a new king who did not know Joseph.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And he proceeded to say to his people: “Look! The people of the sons of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we are.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Come on! Let us deal shrewdly with them, for fear they may multiply, and it must turn out that, in case war should befall us, then they certainly will also be added to those who hate us and will fight against us and go up out of the country.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So they set over them chiefs of forced labor for the purpose of oppressing them in their burden-bearing; and they went building cities as storage places for Phar&acute;aoh, namely, Pi&acute;thom and Ra&middot;am&acute;ses.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But the more they would oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading abroad, so that they felt a sickening dread as a result of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Consequently the Egyptians made the sons of Israel slave under tyranny.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they kept making their life bitter with hard slavery at clay mortar and bricks and with every form of slavery in the field, yes, every form of slavery of theirs in which they used them as slaves under tyranny.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Later on the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, the name of one of whom was Shiph&acute;rah and the name of the other Pu&acute;ah,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">yes, he went so far as to say: “When <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> help the Hebrew women to give birth and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do see them on the stool for childbirth, if it is a son, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must also put it to death; but if it is a daughter, it must also live.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">However, the midwives feared the [true] God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them, but they would preserve the male children alive.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them: “Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have done this thing, in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> preserved the male children alive?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">In turn the midwives said to Phar&acute;aoh: “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. Because they are lively, they have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people kept growing more numerous and becoming very mighty.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And it came about that because the midwives had feared the [true] God he later presented them with families.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally Phar&acute;aoh commanded all his people, saying: “Every newborn son <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to throw into the river Nile, but every daughter <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to preserve alive.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Meantime, a certain man of the house of Le&acute;vi went ahead and took a daughter of Le&acute;vi.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the woman became pregnant and brought a son to birth. When she saw how good-looking he was, she kept him concealed for three lunar months.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">When she was no longer able to conceal him, she then took for him an ark of papyrus and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the child in it and put it among the reeds by the bank of the river Nile.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Further, his sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would be done with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">After a while Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the Nile River, and her female attendants were walking by the side of the Nile River. And she caught sight of the ark in the middle of the reeds. Immediately she sent her slave girl that she might get it.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">When she opened it she got to see the child, and here the boy was weeping. At that she felt compassion for him, although she said: “This is one of the children of the Hebrews.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then his sister said to Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter: “Shall I go and specially call for you a nursing woman from the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for you?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter said to her: “Go!” At once the maiden went and called the child’s mother.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter then said to her: “Take this child with you and nurse him for me, and I myself shall give you your wages.” Accordingly the woman took the child and nursed him.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the child grew up. Then she brought him to Phar&acute;aoh’s daughter, so that he became a son to her; and she proceeded to call his name Moses and to say: “It is because I have drawn him out of the water.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Now it came about in those days, as Moses was becoming strong, that he went out to his brothers that he might look at the burdens they were bearing; and he caught sight of a certain Egyptian striking a certain Hebrew of his brothers.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So he turned this way and that and saw there was nobody in sight. Then he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">However, he went out on the following day and here there were two Hebrew men struggling with each other. So he said to the one in the wrong: “Why should you strike your companion?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At this he said: “Who appointed you as a prince and judge over us? Are you intending to kill me just as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses now got afraid and said: “Surely the thing has become known!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Subsequently Phar&acute;aoh got to hear of this thing, and he attempted to kill Moses; but Moses ran away from Phar&acute;aoh that he might dwell in the land of Mid&acute;i&middot;an; and he took a seat by a well.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now the priest of Mid&acute;i&middot;an had seven daughters, and as usual they came and drew water and filled the gutters to water their father’s flock.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And as usual the shepherds came and drove them away. At this Moses got up and helped the women out and watered their flock.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So when they came home to Reu&acute;el their father he exclaimed: “How is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have come home so quickly today?”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">To this they said: “A certain Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and, besides, he actually drew water for us that he might water the flock.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he said to his daughters: “But where is he? Why is it that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that Moses showed willingness to dwell with the man, and he gave Zip&middot;po&acute;rah his daughter to Moses.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Later she bore a son and he called his name Ger&acute;shom, because, he said: “An alien resident I have come to be in a foreign land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And it came about during those many days that the king of Egypt finally died, but the sons of Israel continued to sigh because of the slavery and to cry out in complaint, and their cry for help kept going up to the [true] God because of the slavery.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">In time God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So God looked on the sons of Israel and God took notice.</span>

       <span id="vs2">Then Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, why, here the thornbush was burning with the fire and yet the thornbush was not consumed.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">At this Moses said: “Let me just turn aside that I may inspect this great phenomenon, as to why the thornbush is not burnt up.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>

       <span id="vs7">And Jehovah added: “Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work; because I well know the pains they suffer.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And I am proceeding to go down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the locality of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And now, look! the outcry of the sons of Israel has come to me, and I have seen also the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And now come and let me send you to Phar&acute;aoh, and you bring my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, Moses said to the [true] God: “Who am I that I should go to Phar&acute;aoh and that I have to bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">To this he said: “Because I shall prove to be with you, and this is the sign for you that it is I who have sent you: After you have brought the people out of Egypt, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will serve the [true] God on this mountain.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Nevertheless, Moses said to the [true] God: “Suppose I am now come to the sons of Israel and I do say to them, ‘The God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers has sent me to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,’ and they do say to me, ‘What is his name?’ What shall I say to them?”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At this God said to Moses: “I <span class="smallcaps">SHALL PROVE TO BE WHAT</span> I <span class="smallcaps">SHALL PROVE TO BE</span>.” And he added: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘I <span class="smallcaps">SHALL PROVE TO BE</span> has sent me to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then God said once more to Moses:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs15-2">“This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has sent me to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.’ This is my name to time indefinite, and this is the memorial of me to generation after generation.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">You go, and you must gather the older men of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘Jehovah the God of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: “I will without fail give attention to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to what is being done to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in Egypt.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And so I say, I shall bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up out of affliction by the Egyptians to the land of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites and the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“And they will certainly listen to your voice, and you must come, you and the older men of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men must say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has come in touch with us, and now we want to go, please, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we want to sacrifice to Jehovah our God.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I, even I, well know that the king of Egypt will not give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> permission to go except by a strong hand.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And I shall have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonderful acts that I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will send <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it will certainly occur that when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> go, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not go empty-handed.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And each woman must ask from her neighbor and from the woman residing as an alien in her house articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must put them upon <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must strip the Egyptians.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">However, Moses in answering said: “But suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice, because they are going to say, ‘Jehovah did not appear to you.’”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Jehovah said to him: “What is that in your hand?” to which he said: “A rod.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Next he said: “Throw it on the earth.” So he threw it on the earth, and it became a serpent; and Moses began to flee from it.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Thrust your hand out and grab hold of it by the tail.” So he thrust his hand out and grabbed hold of it, and it became a rod in his palm.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“In order that,” to quote him, “they may believe that Jehovah the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then Jehovah said to him once more: “Stick your hand, please, into the upper fold of your garment.” So he stuck his hand into the upper fold of his garment. When he drew it out, why, here his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow!</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">After that he said: “Return your hand into the upper fold of your garment.” So he returned his hand into the upper fold of his garment. When he drew it out of the upper fold of his garment, why, here it was restored like the rest of his flesh!</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“And it must occur that,” to quote him, “if they will not believe you and will not listen to the voice of the first sign, then they will certainly believe the voice of the later sign.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Still, it must occur that, if they will not believe even these two signs and will not listen to your voice, then you will have to take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry land; and the water that you will take from the Nile River will certainly become, yes, it will indeed become blood on the dry land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Moses now said to Jehovah: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but I am not a fluent speaker, neither since yesterday nor since before that nor since your speaking to your servant, for I am slow of mouth and slow of tongue.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At that Jehovah said to him: “Who appointed a mouth for man or who appoints the speechless or the deaf or the clear-sighted or the blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So now go, and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth and I will teach you what you ought to say.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But he said: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but send, please, by the hand of the one whom you are going to send.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then Jehovah’s anger grew hot against Moses and he said: “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I do know that he can really speak. And, besides, here he is on his way out to meet you. When he does see you, he will certainly rejoice in his heart.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And you must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to do.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And he must speak for you to the people; and it must occur that he will serve as a mouth to you, and you will serve as God to him.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And this rod you will take in your hand that you may perform the signs with it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Accordingly Moses went and returned to Jeth&acute;ro his father-in-law and said to him: “I want to go, please, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt that I may see whether they are still alive.” So Jeth&acute;ro said to Moses: “Go in peace.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">After that Jehovah said to Moses in Mid&acute;i&middot;an: “Go, return to Egypt, because all the men who were hunting for your soul are dead.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then Moses took his wife and his sons and made them ride on an ass, and he proceeded to return to the land of Egypt. Moreover, Moses took the rod of the [true] God in his hand.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “After you have gone and returned to Egypt see that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men actually perform all the miracles that I have put in your hand before Phar&acute;aoh. As for me, I shall let his heart become obstinate; and he will not send the people away.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And you must say to Phar&acute;aoh, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Israel is my son, my firstborn.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And I say to you: Send my son away that he may serve me. But should you refuse to send him away, here I am killing your son, your firstborn.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Now it came about on the road at the lodging place that Jehovah got to meet him and kept looking for a way to put him to death.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Finally Zip&middot;po&acute;rah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and caused it to touch his feet and said: “It is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Consequently he let go of him. At that time she said: “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Then Jehovah said to Aaron: “Go to meet Moses into the wilderness.” With that he went and met him in the mountain of the [true] God and kissed him.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Moses proceeded to tell Aaron all the words of Jehovah, who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">After that Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the older men of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs under the eyes of the people.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At this the people believed. When they heard that Jehovah had turned his attention to the sons of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="23">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and proceeded to say to Phar&acute;aoh: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Send my people away that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But Phar&acute;aoh said: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">However, they went on to say: “The God of the Hebrews has come in touch with us. We want to go, please, a journey of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise he may strike at us with pestilence or with sword.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At this the king of Egypt said to them: “Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> cause the people to leave off from their works? Go bearing <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> burdens!”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Phar&acute;aoh continued: “Look! The people of the land are now many, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> indeed make them desist from their bearing of burdens.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Immediately on that day Phar&acute;aoh commanded those who drove the people to work and their officers, saying:</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not gather straw to give to the people to make bricks as formerly. Let them themselves go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Moreover, the required amount of bricks that they were making formerly, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will further impose upon them. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not make any reduction for them, because they are relaxing. That is why they are crying out, saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our God!’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Let the service be heavy upon the men and let them work at it, and let them not pay attention to false words.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So those who drove the people to work and their officers went out and said to the people: “Here is what Phar&acute;aoh has said, ‘I am giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> no more straw.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves go, get straw for yourselves wherever <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may find it, because there is to be no reducing of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> services one bit.’”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently the people scattered about over all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And those who drove them to work kept urging them, saying: “Finish <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> works, each one his work, day for day, just as when straw was available.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Later on the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Phar&acute;aoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, these saying: “Why is it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not finish <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> prescribed task in making bricks as formerly, both yesterday and today?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Consequently the officers of the sons of Israel went in and began to cry out to Phar&acute;aoh, saying: “Why do you deal this way with your servants?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">There is no straw given to your servants and yet they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and here your servants are beaten, whereas your own people are at fault.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But he said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are relaxing, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are relaxing! That is why <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And now go, serve! Though no straw will be given to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to give the fixed amount of bricks.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then the officers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in an evil plight at the saying: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not deduct from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> bricks one bit of anyone’s daily rate.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">After that they encountered Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At once they said to them: “May Jehovah look upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and judge, since <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have made us smell offensive before Phar&acute;aoh and before his servants so as to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said: “Jehovah, why have you caused evil to this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For from the time that I went in before Phar&acute;aoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have by no means delivered your people.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Consequently Jehovah said to Moses: “See, I have made you God to Phar&acute;aoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">You—you will speak all that I shall command you; and Aaron your brother will do the speaking to Phar&acute;aoh, and he must send the sons of Israel away from his land.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">As for me, I shall let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, and I shall certainly multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Phar&acute;aoh will not listen to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men; and I shall have to lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my armies, my people, the sons of Israel, out from the land of Egypt with great judgments.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt, and I shall indeed bring the sons of Israel out from their midst.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Moses and Aaron went ahead doing as Jehovah had commanded them. They did just so.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old at the time of their speaking to Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“In case that Phar&acute;aoh speaks to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘Produce a miracle for yourselves,’ then you must say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before Phar&acute;aoh.’ It will become a big snake.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So Moses and Aaron went on in to Phar&acute;aoh and did exactly as Jehovah had commanded. Accordingly Aaron threw his rod down before Phar&acute;aoh and his servants and it became a big snake.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, Phar&acute;aoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and the magic-practicing priests of Egypt themselves also proceeded to do the same thing with their magic arts.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">So they threw down each one his rod, and they became big snakes; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Still, Phar&acute;aoh’s heart became obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Phar&acute;aoh’s heart is unresponsive. He has refused to send the people away.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Go to Phar&acute;aoh in the morning. Look! He is going out to the water! And you must put yourself in position to meet him by the edge of the Nile River, and the rod that turned into a serpent you are to take in your hand.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And you must say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying: “Send my people away that they may serve me in the wilderness,” but here you have not obeyed until now.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">This is what Jehovah has said: “By this you will know that I am Jehovah. Here I am striking with the rod that is in my hand upon the water that is in the Nile River, and it will certainly turn into blood.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the fish that are in the Nile River will die, and the Nile River will actually stink, and the Egyptians will simply have no stomach for drinking water from the Nile River.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Subsequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their Nile canals and over their reedy pools and over all their impounded waters, that they may become blood.’ And there will certainly be blood in all the land of Egypt and in the wooden vessels and in the stone vessels.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Immediately Moses and Aaron did so, just as Jehovah had commanded, and he lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile River under the eyes of Phar&acute;aoh and his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile River was turned into blood.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the fish that were in the Nile River died, and the Nile River began to stink; and the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the Nile River; and the blood came to be in all the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Nevertheless, the magic-practicing priests of Egypt proceeded to do the same thing with their secret arts; so that Phar&acute;aoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Hence Phar&acute;aoh turned and went into his house, and he did not set his heart to have any regard for this either.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And all the Egyptians went digging round about the Nile River for water to drink, because they were unable to drink any water of the Nile River.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And seven days came to be fulfilled after Jehovah’s striking the Nile River.</span>

<p class="title">Exodus 8:1-32</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="40">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="32">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar&acute;aoh, and you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And if you keep refusing to send them away, here I am plaguing all your territory with frogs.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the Nile River will fairly teem with frogs, and they will certainly come up and enter into your house and your inner bedroom and upon your couch and into the houses of your servants and on your people and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And on you and on your people and on all your servants the frogs will come up.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later on Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch your hand with your rod out over the rivers, the Nile canals and the reedy pools and make the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.’”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">At that Aaron stretched his hand out over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">However, the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts and made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In time Phar&acute;aoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Entreat Jehovah that he may remove the frogs from me and my people, as I want to send the people away that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Moses said to Phar&acute;aoh: “You take the glory over me to say when I shall make entreaty for you and your servants and your people in order to cut the frogs off from you and your houses. Only in the Nile River will they be left.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">To this he said: “Tomorrow.” So he said: “It will be according to your word, in order that you may know that there is no one else like Jehovah our God,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">in that the frogs will certainly turn away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. Only in the Nile River will they be left.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Accordingly Moses and Aaron went out from Phar&acute;aoh, and Moses cried out to Jehovah because of the frogs that He had put upon Phar&acute;aoh.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and the frogs began to die off from the houses, the courtyards and the fields.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they went piling them up, heaps upon heaps, and the land began to stink.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When Phar&acute;aoh got to see that relief had taken place, he made his heart unresponsive; and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch your rod out and strike the dust of the earth, and it must become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And they proceeded to do this. So Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and the gnats came to be on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the magic-practicing priests tried to do the same by their secret arts, in order to bring forth gnats, but they were unable. And the gnats came to be on man and beast.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Hence the magic-practicing priests said to Phar&acute;aoh: “It is the finger of God!” But Phar&acute;aoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and take a position in front of Phar&acute;aoh. Look! He is coming out to the water! And you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But if you are not sending my people away, here I am sending upon you and your servants and your people and into your houses the gadfly; and the houses of Egypt will simply be full of the gadfly, and also the ground upon which they are.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And on that day I shall certainly make the land of Go&acute;shen upon which my people are standing distinct, that no gadfly may exist there; in order that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And I shall indeed set a demarcation between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will take place.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Jehovah proceeded to do so; and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of Phar&acute;aoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land came to ruin as a result of the gadflies.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Finally Phar&acute;aoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Go, sacrifice to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God in the land.”</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But Moses said: “It is not admissible to do so, because we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God a thing detestable to the Egyptians. Suppose we would sacrifice a thing detestable to the Egyptians before their eyes; would they not stone us?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">We shall go a journey of three days into the wilderness and we shall definitely sacrifice to Jehovah our God just as he has said to us.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Phar&acute;aoh now said: “I—I shall send <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> away, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will indeed sacrifice to Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God in the wilderness. Only do not make it quite so far away that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are going. Make entreaty in my behalf.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Then Moses said: “Here I am going forth from you, and I shall indeed make entreaty to Jehovah, and the gadflies will certainly turn away from Phar&acute;aoh, his servants and his people tomorrow. Only let not Phar&acute;aoh trifle again in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">After that Moses went out from Phar&acute;aoh and made entreaty to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and the gadflies turned away from Phar&acute;aoh, his servants and his people. Not one was left.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">However, Phar&acute;aoh made his heart unresponsive this time also and did not send the people away.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Consequently Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar&acute;aoh and you must state to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">But if you continue refusing to send them away and you are still keeping hold of them,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">look! Jehovah’s hand is coming upon your livestock that is in the field. On the horses, the asses, the camels, the herd and the flock there will be a very heavy pestilence.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing of all that belongs to the sons of Israel will die.”’”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Moreover, Jehovah set an appointed time, saying: “Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly Jehovah did this thing on the next day, and all sorts of livestock of Egypt began to die; but not one of the livestock of the sons of Israel died.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then Phar&acute;aoh sent, and, look! not so much as one of Israel’s livestock had died. Nevertheless, Phar&acute;aoh’s heart continued to be unresponsive, and he did not send the people away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">After that Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: “Take for yourselves both hands full of soot from a kiln, and Moses must toss it toward the heavens in Phar&acute;aoh’s sight.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And it must become a powder upon all the land of Egypt, and it must become boils breaking out with blisters upon man and beast in all the land of Egypt.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So they took the soot of a kiln and stood before Phar&acute;aoh, and Moses tossed it toward the heavens, and it became boils with blisters, breaking out on man and beast.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before Moses as a result of the boils, because the boils had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the Egyptians.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But Jehovah let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had stated to Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and take a position in front of Phar&acute;aoh, and you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away that they may serve me.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For at this time I am sending all my blows against your heart and upon your servants and your people, to the end that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For by now I could have thrust my hand out that I might strike you and your people with pestilence and that you might be effaced from the earth.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But, in fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Are you still behaving haughtily against my people in not sending them away?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Here I am causing it to rain down tomorrow about this time a very heavy hail, the like of which has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And now send, bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter. As for any man and beast that will be found in the field and not gathered into the house, the hail will have to come down upon them, and they will have to die.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Anyone who feared Jehovah’s word among Phar&acute;aoh’s servants caused his own servants and his livestock to flee into the houses,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">but whoever did not set his heart to have any regard for Jehovah’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that hail may come on all the land of Egypt, upon man and beast and all vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens; and Jehovah gave thunders and hail, and fire would run down to the earth, and Jehovah kept making it rain down hail upon the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Thus there came hail, and fire quivering in among the hail. It was very heavy, so that there had not occurred any like it in all the land of Egypt from the time it became a nation.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And the hail went striking at all the land of Egypt. The hail struck everything that was in the field, from man to beast, and all sorts of vegetation of the field; and it shattered all sorts of trees of the field.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Only in the land of Go&acute;shen, where the sons of Israel were, there occurred no hail.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Eventually Phar&acute;aoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them: “I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are in the wrong.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Entreat Jehovah that this may be enough of the occurring of God’s thunders and hail. Then I am willing to send <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> away, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not stay any longer.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">So Moses said to him: “As soon as I go out of the city I shall spread my hands up to Jehovah. The thunders will stop and the hail will not continue any longer, in order that you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">As for you and your servants, I know already that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not even then show fear because of Jehovah God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">As it was, the flax and the barley had been struck, because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But the wheat and the spelt had not been struck, because they were seasonally late.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Moses now went out of the city from Phar&acute;aoh and spread his hands up to Jehovah, and the thunders and the hail began to stop and rain did not pour down on the earth.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">When Phar&acute;aoh got to see that the rain and the hail and the thunders had stopped, he went sinning again and making his heart unresponsive, he as well as his servants.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And Phar&acute;aoh’s heart continued obstinate, and he did not send the sons of Israel away, just as Jehovah had stated by means of Moses.</span>

<p class="title">Exodus 10:1-29</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="40">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="29">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Phar&acute;aoh, because I—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly know that I am Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So Moses and Aaron went in to Phar&acute;aoh and said to him: “This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said, ‘How long must you refuse to submit yourself to me? Send my people away that they may serve me.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For if you continue refusing to send my people away, here I am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And they will actually cover the visible surface of the earth and it will not be possible to see the earth; and they will simply eat up the rest of what has escaped, what has been left to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people by the hail, and they will certainly eat every sprouting tree of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> out of the field.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all Egypt will be filled to an extent that your fathers and your fathers’ fathers have not seen it from the day of their existing upon the ground until this day.’” With that he turned and went out from Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">After that Phar&acute;aoh’s servants said to him: “How long will this man prove to be as a snare to us? Send the men away that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt has perished?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Phar&acute;aoh, and he said to them: “Go, serve Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God. Who in particular are the ones going?”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Moses said: “With our young people and our old people we shall go. With our sons and our daughters, with our sheep and our cattle we shall go, for we have a festival to Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In turn he said to them: “Let it prove to be so, that Jehovah is with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> when I shall send <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> little ones away! See, on the contrary, something evil is <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> aim.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Not so! Go, please, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are able-bodied men, and serve Jehovah, because that is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are seeking to secure.” With that they were driven out from before Phar&acute;aoh.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land, everything that the hail has let remain.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At once Moses stretched his rod out over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow upon the land all that day and all night. The morning came and the east wind carried the locusts.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the locusts began to come up over all the land of Egypt and to settle down upon all the territory of Egypt. They were very burdensome. Before them there had never turned up in this way locusts like them, and there will never turn up any in this way after them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And they went covering the visible surface of the entire land, and the land grew dark; and they went on eating up all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there was left nothing green on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">So Phar&acute;aoh hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and said: “I have sinned against Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God and against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And now pardon, please, my sin just this once and <span class="smallcaps">ENTREAT</span> Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God that he may turn away just this deadly plague from upon me.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">So he went out from Phar&acute;aoh and made entreaty to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Jehovah made a shift to a very stiff west wind, and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was let remain in all the territory of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">However, Jehovah let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not send the sons of Israel away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jehovah then said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out toward the heavens, that darkness may occur over the land of Egypt and the darkness may be felt.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Moses immediately stretched his hand out toward the heavens, and a gloomy darkness began to occur in all the land of Egypt for three days.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">They did not see one another, and none of them got up from his own place three days; but for all the sons of Israel there proved to be light in their dwellings.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">After that Phar&acute;aoh called Moses and said: “Go, <span class="smallcaps">SERVE</span> Jehovah. Only <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sheep and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> cattle will be detained. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> little ones also may go with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But Moses said: “You yourself will also give into our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings, as we must render them to Jehovah our God.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And our livestock will also go with us. Not a hoof will be allowed to remain, because it is from them that we shall take some to worship Jehovah our God, and we ourselves do not know what we shall render in worship to Jehovah until our arriving there.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">At this Jehovah let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he did not consent to send them away.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">So Phar&acute;aoh said to him: “Get out from me! Watch yourself! Do not try to see my face again, because on the day of your seeing my face you will die.”</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">To this Moses said: “That is the way you have spoken. I shall not try to see your face anymore.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah proceeded to say to Moses: “One plague more I am going to bring upon Phar&acute;aoh and Egypt. After that he will send <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> away from here. At the time he sends <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> away altogether, he will literally drive <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out from here.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Speak, now, in the ears of the people, that they should ask every man of his companion and every woman of her companion articles of silver and articles of gold.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Accordingly Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. The man Moses too was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Phar&acute;aoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Moses went on to say: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and every firstborn in the land of Egypt must die, from the firstborn of Phar&acute;aoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant who is at the hand mill and every firstborn of beast.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And there will certainly occur a great outcry in all the land of Egypt, the like of which has never yet occurred, and the like of which will never be brought about again.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But against any of the sons of Israel will no dog move eagerly its tongue, from man to beast; in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the sons of Israel.’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And all these servants of yours will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow your steps.’ And after that I shall go out.” With that he went out from Phar&acute;aoh in the heat of anger.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Phar&acute;aoh will not listen to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, in order for my miracles to be increased in the land of Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Phar&acute;aoh; but Jehovah would let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, so that he did not send the sons of Israel away from his land.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This month will be the start of the months for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. It will be the first of the months of the year for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month they are to take for themselves each one a sheep for the ancestral house, a sheep to a house.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But if the household proves to be too small for the sheep, then he and his neighbor close by must take it into his house according to the number of souls; <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should compute each one proportionate to his eating as regards the sheep.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">The sheep should prove to be sound, a male, a year old, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> may pick from the young rams or from the goats.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And it must continue under safeguard by <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it between the two evenings.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they must take some of the blood and splash it upon the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway belonging to the houses in which they will eat it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘And they must eat the flesh on this night. They should eat it roasted with fire and with unfermented cakes along with bitter greens.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, cooked in water, but roast with fire, its head together with its shanks and its interior parts.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not leave any of it over till morning, but what is left over of it till morning <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should burn with fire.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And in this way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should eat it, with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hips girded, sandals on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> staff in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must eat it in haste. It is Jehovah’s passover.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I must pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I shall execute judgments. I am Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the blood must serve as <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sign upon the houses where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are; and I must see the blood and pass over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and the plague will not come on <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as a ruination when I strike at the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘And this day must serve as a memorial for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations. As a statute to time indefinite <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should celebrate it.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Seven days <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to eat unfermented cakes. Yes, on the first day <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to take away sourdough from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses, because anyone eating what is leavened, from the first day down to the seventh, that soul must be cut off from Israel.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And on the first day there is to take place for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a holy convention, and on the seventh day a holy convention. No work is to be done on them. Only what every soul needs to eat, that alone may be done for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“‘And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep the festival of unfermented cakes, because on this very day I must bring <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> armies out from the land of Egypt. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep this day throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations as a statute to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to eat unfermented cakes down till the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Seven days no sourdough is to be found in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses, because anyone tasting what is leavened, whether he is an alien resident or a native of the land, that soul must be cut off from the assembly of Israel.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Nothing leavened are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to eat. In all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dwellings <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to eat unfermented cakes.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Promptly Moses called all the older men of Israel and said to them: “Draw out and take for yourselves small cattle according to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> families, and slaughter the passover victim.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must take a bunch of hyssop and dip it into the blood in a basin and strike upon the upper part of the doorway and upon the two doorposts some of the blood that is in the basin; and none of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should go out of the entrance of his house until morning.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then when Jehovah does pass through to plague the Egyptians and does see the blood upon the upper part of the doorway and upon the two doorposts, Jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance, and he will not allow the ruination to enter into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> houses to plague <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep this thing as a regulation for you and your sons to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And it must occur that when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come into the land that Jehovah will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, just as he has stated, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must keep this service.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And it must occur that when <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons say to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, ‘What does this service mean to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?’</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when he plagued the Egyptians, but he delivered our houses.’”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs27-2">Then the people bowed low and prostrated themselves.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Subsequently the sons of Israel went and did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And it came about that at midnight Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Phar&acute;aoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison hole, and every firstborn of beast.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then Phar&acute;aoh got up at night, he and all his servants and all [other] Egyptians; and there began arising a great outcry among the Egyptians, because there was not a house where there was not one dead.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At once he called Moses and Aaron by night and said: “Get up, get out from the midst of my people, both <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and the [other] sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have stated.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Take both <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flocks and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> herds, just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have stated, and go. Also, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must bless me besides.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the Egyptians began to urge the people in order to send them away quickly out of the land, “because,” they said, “we are all as good as dead!”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Consequently the people carried their flour dough before it was leavened, with their kneading troughs wrapped up in their mantles upon their shoulder.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses in that they went asking from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that these granted them what was asked; and they stripped the Egyptians.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And the sons of Israel proceeded to depart from Ram&acute;e&middot;ses for Suc&acute;coth, to the number of six hundred thousand able-bodied men on foot, besides little ones.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And a vast mixed company also went up with them, as well as flocks and herds, a very numerous stock of animals.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And they began to bake the flour dough that they had brought out from Egypt into round cakes, unfermented cakes, because it had not leavened, for they had been driven out of Egypt and had not been able to linger and too they had not prepared any provisions for themselves.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And the dwelling of the sons of Israel, who had dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And it came about at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, it even came about on this very day that all the armies of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">It is a night for observance with regard to Jehovah for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. With regard to Jehovah this night is one for observance on the part of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses and Aaron: “This is the statute of the passover: No foreigner may eat of it.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">But where there is any slave man purchased with money, you must circumcise him. Then first he may share in eating it.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">A settler and a hired laborer may not eat of it.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">In one house it is to be eaten. You must not take any of the flesh out of the house to some place outside. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not break a bone in it.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">All the assembly of Israel are to celebrate it.</span> <a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">And in case an alien resident resides as an alien with you and he will actually celebrate the passover to Jehovah, let there be a circumcising of every male of his. First then he may come near to celebrate it; and he must become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">One law is to exist for the native and for the alien resident who is residing as an alien in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> midst.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">So all the sons of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.</span> <a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">And it came about on this very day that Jehovah brought the sons of Israel together with their armies out of the land of Egypt.</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Sanctify to me every male firstborn that opens each womb among the sons of Israel, among men and beasts. It is mine.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Moses went on to say to the people: “Let there be a remembering of this day on which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> went out of Egypt, from the house of slaves, because by strength of hand Jehovah brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out from here. So nothing leavened may be eaten.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Today <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are going out in the month of A&acute;bib.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it must occur that when Jehovah will have brought you into the land of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites and the Hit&acute;tites and the Am&acute;or&middot;ites and the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites, which he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you must render this service in this month.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Seven days you are to eat unfermented cakes, and on the seventh day is a festival to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Unfermented cakes are to be eaten for the seven days; and nothing leavened is to be seen with you, and no sourdough is to be seen with you within all your boundaries.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And you must tell your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which Jehovah has done to me when I came out of Egypt.’</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And it must serve for you as a sign upon your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, in order that Jehovah’s law may prove to be in your mouth; because by a strong hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And you must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.</span>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“And it must occur that when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, just as he has sworn to you and to your forefathers, and when he does give it to you,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">then you must devote everyone that opens the womb to Jehovah, and every firstling, the young of a beast, which will come to be yours. The males belong to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And every firstling ass you are to redeem with a sheep, and if you will not redeem it, then you must break its neck. And every firstborn of man among your sons you are to redeem.</span>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And it must occur that in case your son should inquire of you later on, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ then you must say to him, ‘By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slaves.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it came about that Phar&acute;aoh showed obstinacy toward sending us away, and Jehovah proceeded to kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast. That is why I am sacrificing to Jehovah all the males that open the womb, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it must serve as a sign upon your hand and as a frontlet band between your eyes, because by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it came about at the time of Phar&acute;aoh’s sending the people away that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Phi&middot;lis&acute;tines just because it was near, for God said: “It might be the people will feel regret when they see war and will certainly return to Egypt.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Hence God made the people go round about by the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. But it was in battle formation that the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Moses was taking Joseph’s bones with him, because he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying: “God will without fail turn his attention to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must take my bones up out of here with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And they proceeded to depart from Suc&acute;coth and to encamp at E&acute;tham at the edge of the wilderness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah was going ahead of them in the daytime in a pillar of cloud to lead them by the way, and in the nighttime in a pillar of fire to give them light to go in the daytime and nighttime.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">The pillar of cloud would not move away from before the people in the daytime nor the pillar of fire in the nighttime.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="31">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Speak to the sons of Israel, that they should turn back and encamp before Pi&middot;ha&middot;hi&acute;roth between Mig&acute;dol and the sea in view of Ba&acute;al-ze&acute;phon. In front of it <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are to encamp by the sea.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then Phar&acute;aoh will certainly say respecting the sons of Israel, ‘They are wandering in confusion in the land. The wilderness has closed in upon them.’</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So I shall indeed let Phar&acute;aoh’s heart become obstinate, and he will certainly chase after them and I shall get glory for myself by means of Phar&acute;aoh and all his military forces; and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” Accordingly they did just that.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Later it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away. Immediately the heart of Phar&acute;aoh as well as his servants was changed regarding the people, so that they said: “What is this that we have done, in that we have sent Israel away from slaving for us?”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So he proceeded to make his war chariots ready, and he took his people with him.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And he proceeded to take six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt and warriors upon every one of them.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Thus Jehovah let the heart of Phar&acute;aoh the king of Egypt become obstinate, and he went chasing after the sons of Israel, while the sons of Israel were going out with uplifted hand.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the Egyptians went chasing after them, and all the chariot horses of Phar&acute;aoh and his cavalrymen and his military forces were overtaking them while camping by the sea, by Pi&middot;ha&middot;hi&acute;roth in view of Ba&acute;al-ze&acute;phon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">When Phar&acute;aoh got close by, the sons of Israel began to raise their eyes and here the Egyptians were marching after them; and the sons of Israel got quite afraid and began to cry out to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they proceeded to say to Moses: “Is it because there are no burial places at all in Egypt that you have taken us here to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than for us to die in the wilderness.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Then Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will perform for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> today. For the Egyptians whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do see today <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not see again, no, never again.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Jehovah will himself fight for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will be silent.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Why do you keep crying out to me? Speak to the sons of Israel that they should break camp.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">As for you, lift up your rod and stretch your hand out over the sea and split it apart, that the sons of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry land.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As for me, here I am letting the hearts of the Egyptians become obstinate, that they may go in after them and that I may get glory for myself by means of Phar&acute;aoh and all his military forces, his war chariots and his cavalrymen.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I get glory for myself by means of Phar&acute;aoh, his war chariots and his cavalrymen.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then the angel of the [true] God who was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their rear, and the pillar of cloud departed from their van and stood in the rear of them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So it came in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. On the one hand it proved to be a cloud together with darkness. On the other hand it kept lighting up the night. And this group did not come near that group all night long.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Moses now stretched his hand out over the sea; and Jehovah began making the sea go back by a strong east wind all night long and converting the sea basin into dry ground, and the waters were being split apart.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">At length the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on dry land, while the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all the horses of Phar&acute;aoh, his war chariots and his cavalrymen began going in after them, into the midst of the sea.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And it came about during the morning watch that Jehovah began to look out upon the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of fire and cloud, and he went throwing the camp of the Egyptians into confusion.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And he kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty; and the Egyptians began to say: “Let us flee from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah certainly fights for them against the Egyptians.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Finally Jehovah said to Moses: “Stretch your hand out over the sea, that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, their war chariots and their cavalrymen.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Moses at once stretched his hand out over the sea, and the sea began to come back to its normal condition at the approaching of morning. All the while the Egyptians were fleeing from encountering it, but Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the waters kept coming back. Finally they covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen belonging to all of Phar&acute;aoh’s military forces and who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as one among them was let remain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">As for the sons of Israel, they walked on dry land in the midst of the seabed, and the waters were for them a wall on their right hand and on their left.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Thus on that day Jehovah saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel got to see the Egyptians dead on the seashore.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Israel also got to see the great hand that Jehovah put in action against the Egyptians; and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in Moses his servant.</span>

       <span id="vs24">And the people began to murmur against Moses, saying: “What are we to drink?”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then he cried out to Jehovah. So Jehovah directed him to a tree, and he threw it into the water and the water became sweet.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs25-2">There He established for them a regulation and a case for judgment and there he put them to the test.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And he went on to say: “If you will strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in his eyes and will indeed give ear to his commandments and keep all his regulations, I shall put none of the maladies upon you that I put upon the Egyptians; because I am Jehovah who is healing you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">After that they came to E&acute;lim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. So they went camping there by the water.</span>

<p class="title">Exodus 16:1-36</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="40">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="36">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Later they departed from E&acute;lim, and the entire assembly of the sons of Israel finally came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between E&acute;lim and Si&acute;nai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their coming out of the land of Egypt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the entire assembly of the sons of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the sons of Israel kept saying to them: “If only we had died by Jehovah’s hand in the land of Egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat, while we were eating bread to satisfaction, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Here I am raining down bread for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the heavens; and the people must go out and pick up each his amount day for day, in order that I may put them to the test as to whether they will walk in my law or not.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And it must occur on the sixth day that they must prepare what they will bring in, and it must prove double what they keep picking up day by day.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel: “At evening <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly know that it is Jehovah who has brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out from the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And in the morning <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will indeed see Jehovah’s glory, because he has heard <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should murmur against us?”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Moses continued: “It will be when Jehovah gives <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to satisfaction, because Jehovah has heard <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> murmurings that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are murmuring against him. And what are we? Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Moses went on to say to Aaron: “Say to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, ‘Come near before Jehovah, because he has heard <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> murmurings.’”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then it occurred that as soon as Aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, they turned and faced toward the wilderness, and, look! Jehovah’s glory appeared in the cloud.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘Between the two evenings <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will eat meat and in the morning <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be satisfied with bread; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly know that I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Accordingly it occurred that in the evening the quails began to come up and cover the camp, and in the morning there had developed a layer of dew round about the camp.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">In time the layer of dew evaporated and here upon the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flaky thing, fine like hoarfrost upon the earth.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">When the sons of Israel got to see it, they began to say to one another: “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Hence Moses said to them: “It is the bread that Jehovah has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for food.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">This is the word that Jehovah has commanded, ‘Pick up some of it, each one in proportion to his eating. Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are to take an omer measure for each individual according to the number of the souls that each of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> has in his tent.’”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the sons of Israel began to do so; and they went picking it up, some gathering much and some gathering little.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">When they would measure it by the omer, he that had gathered much had no surplus and he that had gathered little had no shortage. They picked it up each one in proportion to his eating.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then Moses said to them: “Let nobody leave any of it until the morning.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But they did not listen to Moses. When some men would leave some of it until the morning, it would breed worms and stink; so that Moses became indignant at them.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they would pick it up morning by morning, each one in proportion to his eating. When the sun got hot, it melted.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And it came about on the sixth day that they picked up twice as much bread, two omer measures for one person. So all the chieftains of the assembly came and reported it to Moses.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At that he said to them: “It is what Jehovah has spoken. Tomorrow there will be a sabbath observance of a holy sabbath to Jehovah. What <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can bake, bake, and what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can boil, boil, and all the surplus that there is save it up for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as something to be kept until the morning.”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Accordingly they saved it up until the morning, just as Moses had commanded; and it did not stink nor did maggots develop in it.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then Moses said: “Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not find it in the field.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Six days <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will pick it up, but on the seventh day is a sabbath. On it none will form.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">However, it came about on the seventh day that some of the people did go out to pick [it] up, but they found none.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Consequently Jehovah said to Moses: “How long must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Mark the fact that Jehovah has given <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the sabbath. That is why he is giving <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on the sixth day the bread of two days. Keep sitting each one in his own place. Let nobody go out from his locality on the seventh day.”</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And the people proceeded to observe the sabbath on the seventh day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And the house of Israel began to call its name “manna.” And it was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Then Moses said: “This is the word that Jehovah has commanded, ‘Fill an omer measure of it as something to be kept throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations, in order that they may see the bread that I made <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> eat in the wilderness when I was bringing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of the land of Egypt.’”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">So Moses said to Aaron: “Take a jar and put in it an omerful of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations.”</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, Aaron proceeded to deposit it before the Testimony as something to be kept.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until their coming to a land inhabited. The manna was what they ate until their coming to the frontier of the land of Ca&acute;naan.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Now an omer is a tenth of an e&acute;phah measure.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the entire assembly of the sons of Israel proceeded to depart from the wilderness of Sin by stages, which they took according to the order of Jehovah, and went camping at Reph&acute;i&middot;dim. But there was no water for the people to drink.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And the people fell to quarreling with Moses and saying: “Give us water that we may drink.” But Moses said to them: “Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> quarreling with me? Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep putting Jehovah to the test?”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the people went on thirsting there for water, and the people kept murmuring against Moses and saying: “Why is it that you have brought us up out of Egypt to put us and our sons and our livestock to death by thirst?”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying: “What shall I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Pass in front of the people and take with you some of the older men of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River. Take it in your hand and you must walk on.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Look! I am standing before you there on the rock in Ho&acute;reb. And you must strike on the rock, and water must come out of it, and the people must drink it.” Subsequently Moses did so under the eyes of the older men of Israel.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So he called the name of the place Mas&acute;sah and Mer&acute;i&middot;bah, because of the quarreling of the sons of Israel and because of their putting Jehovah to the test, saying: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites proceeded to come and fight against Israel in Reph&acute;i&middot;dim.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this Moses said to Joshua: “Choose men for us and go out, fight against the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites. Tomorrow I am stationing myself upon the top of the hill, with the rod of the [true] God in my hand.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Joshua did just as Moses had said to him, in order to fight against the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it occurred that as soon as Moses would lift his hand up, the Israelites proved superior; but as soon as he would let down his hand, the A&middot;mal&acute;ek&middot;ites proved superior.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When the hands of Moses were heavy, then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side and the other on that side, so that his hands held steady until the sun set.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Hence Joshua vanquished Am&acute;a&middot;lek and his people with the edge of the sword.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Write this as a memorial in the book and propound it in Joshua’s ears, ‘I shall completely wipe out the remembrance of Am&acute;a&middot;lek from under the heavens.’”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And Moses proceeded to build an altar and to call its name Je&middot;ho&acute;vah-nis&acute;si,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">saying: “Because a hand is against the throne of Jah, Jehovah will have war with Am&acute;a&middot;lek from generation to generation.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now Jeth&acute;ro the priest of Mid&acute;i&middot;an, Moses’ father-in-law, got to hear about all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So Jeth&acute;ro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zip&middot;po&acute;rah, Moses’ wife, after the sending of her away,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and her two sons, the name of one of whom was Ger&acute;shom, “because,” he said, “an alien resident I have come to be in a foreign land”;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and the name of the other was E&middot;li&middot;e&acute;zer, “because,” to quote him, “the God of my father is my helper in that he delivered me from Phar&acute;aoh’s sword.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So Jeth&acute;ro, Moses’ father-in-law, and his sons and his wife came to Moses into the wilderness where he was camping, at the mountain of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then he sent word to Moses: “I, your father-in-law, Jeth&acute;ro, am come to you, and also your wife and her two sons with her.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">At once Moses went on out to meet his father-in-law, and he proceeded to prostrate himself and to kiss him; and they each one began asking how the other was getting along. After that they went into the tent.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Moses went to relating to his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Phar&acute;aoh and Egypt on account of Israel, and all the hardship that had befallen them in the way, and yet Jehovah was delivering them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then Jeth&acute;ro felt glad over all the good that Jehovah had done for Israel in that he had delivered them from the hand of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Consequently Jeth&acute;ro said: “Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Phar&acute;aoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Now I do know that Jehovah is greater than all the [other] gods by reason of this affair in which they acted presumptuously against them.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then Jeth&acute;ro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron and all the older men of Israel came to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law, before the [true] God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And it came about on the next day that Moses sat down as usual to serve as judge for the people, and the people kept standing before Moses from the morning till the evening.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Moses’ father-in-law got to see all that he was doing for the people. So he said: “What kind of business is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone continue sitting and all the people continue taking their stand before you from morning till evening?”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then Moses said to his father-in-law: “Because the people keep coming to me to inquire of God.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In the event that they have a case arise, it must come to me and I must judge between the one party and the other, and I must make known the decisions of the [true] God and his laws.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">At this Moses’ father-in-law said to him: “It is not good the way you are doing.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">You will surely wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because this business is too big a load for you. You are unable to do it by yourself.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Now listen to my voice. I shall advise you, and God will prove to be with you. You yourself serve as representative for the people before the [true] God, and you yourself must bring the cases to the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And you must warn them of what the regulations and the laws are, and you must make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But you yourself should select out of all the people capable men, fearing God, trustworthy men, hating unjust profit; and you must set these over them as chiefs over thousands, chiefs over hundreds, chiefs over fifties and chiefs over tens.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And they must judge the people on every proper occasion; and it must occur that every big case they will bring to you, but every small case they themselves will handle as judges. So make it lighter for yourself, and they must carry the load with you.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">If you do this very thing, and God has commanded you, you will then certainly be able to stand it and, besides, this people will all come to their own place in peace.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Immediately Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Moses proceeded to choose capable men out of all Israel and to give them positions as heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And they judged the people on every proper occasion. A hard case they would bring to Moses, but every small case they themselves would handle as judges.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">After that Moses saw his father-in-law off, and he went his way to his land.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="25">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">In the third month after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came into the wilderness of Si&acute;nai.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And they proceeded to pull away from Reph&acute;i&middot;dim and to come into the wilderness of Si&acute;nai and to encamp in the wilderness; and Israel went camping there in front of the mountain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Moses went up to the [true] God, and Jehovah began to call to him out of the mountain, saying: “This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and to tell the sons of Israel,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, that I might carry <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> on wings of eagles and bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to myself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And now if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly become my special property out of all [other] peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the sons of Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So Moses came and called the older men of the people and set before them all these words that Jehovah had commanded him.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">After that all the people answered unanimously and said: “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.” Immediately Moses took back the words of the people to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At this Jehovah said to Moses: “Look! I am coming to you in a dark cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you, and that in you also they may put faith to time indefinite.” Then Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Go to the people, and you must sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they must wash their mantles.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they must prove ready for the third day, because on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people upon Mount Si&acute;nai.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And you must set bounds for the people round about, saying, ‘Guard yourselves against going up into the mountain, and do not touch the edge of it. Anybody touching the mountain will positively be put to death.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">No hand is to touch him, because he will positively be stoned or will positively be shot through. Whether beast or man, he will not live.’ At the blowing of the ram’s horn they themselves may come up to the mountain.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he set about sanctifying the people; and they engaged in washing their mantles.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Accordingly he said to the people: “Get ready during the three days. Do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men come near a woman.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And on the third day when it became morning it came about that thunders and lightnings began occurring, and a heavy cloud upon the mountain and a very loud sound of a horn, so that all the people who were in the camp began to tremble.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the [true] God, and they went taking their stand at the base of the mountain.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Mount Si&acute;nai smoked all over, due to the fact that Jehovah came down upon it in fire; and its smoke kept ascending like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling very much.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">When the sound of the horn became continually louder and louder, Moses began to speak, and the [true] God began to answer him with a voice.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Jehovah came down upon Mount Si&acute;nai to the top of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went on up.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go down, warn the people, that they do not try to break through to Jehovah to take a look and many of them have to fall.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And let the priests also who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify themselves, that Jehovah may not break out upon them.”</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">At this Moses said to Jehovah: “The people are not able to come up to Mount Si&acute;nai, because you yourself already warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds for the mountain and make it sacred.’”</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, Jehovah said to him: “Go, descend, and you must come up, you and Aaron with you; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, that he may not break out upon them.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Accordingly Moses descended to the people and told them.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And God proceeded to speak all these words, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“I am Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">You must not have any other gods against my face.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation, in the case of those who hate me;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but exercising loving-kindness toward the thousandth generation in the case of those who love me and keep my commandments.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Remembering the sabbath day to hold it sacred,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">you are to render service and you must do all your work six days.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your alien resident who is inside your gates.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day. That is why Jehovah blessed the sabbath day and proceeded to make it sacred.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Honor your father and your mother in order that your days may prove long upon the ground that Jehovah your God is giving you.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“You must not murder.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“You must not commit adultery.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“You must not steal.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“You must not testify falsely as a witness against your fellowman.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“You must not desire your fellowman’s house. You must not desire your fellowman’s wife, nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his ass nor anything that belongs to your fellowman.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now all the people were seeing the thunders and the lightning flashes and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking. When the people got to see it, then they quivered and stood at a distance.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And they began to say to Moses: “You speak with us, and let us listen; but let not God speak with us for fear we may die.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">So Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid, because for the sake of putting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to the test the [true] God has come, and in order that the fear of him may continue before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faces that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not sin.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went near to the dark cloud mass where the [true] God was.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves have seen that it was from the heavens I spoke with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not make along with me gods of silver, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not make gods of gold for yourselves.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">An altar of ground you are to make for me, and you must sacrifice upon it your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices, your flock and your herd. In every place where I shall cause my name to be remembered I shall come to you and shall certainly bless you.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And if you should make an altar of stones for me, you must not build them as hewn stones. In the event that you do wield your chisel upon it, then you will profane it.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And you must not go up by steps to my altar, that your private parts may not be exposed upon it.’</span>

       <span id="vs3">If he should come in by himself, by himself he will go out. If he is the owner of a wife, then his wife must go out with him.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">If his master should give him a wife and she does bear him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will become her master’s and he will go out by himself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But if the slave should insistently say, ‘I really love my master, my wife and my sons; I do not want to go out as one set free,’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">then his master must bring him near to the [true] God and must bring him up against the door or the doorpost; and his master must pierce his ear through with an awl, and he must be his slave to time indefinite.</span>

       <span id="vs8">If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master so that he does not designate her as a concubine but causes her to be redeemed, he will not be entitled to sell her to a foreign people in his treacherously dealing with her.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And if it should be to his son that he designates her, he is to do to her according to the due right of daughters.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">If he should take another wife for himself, her sustenance, her clothing and her marriage due are not to be diminished.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs23">But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>

       <span id="vs27">And if it should be the tooth of his slave man or the tooth of his slave girl that he knocks out, he is to send him away as one set free in compensation for his tooth.</span>

       <span id="vs28">“And in case a bull should gore a man or a woman and that one actually dies, the bull is to be stoned without fail, but its flesh is not to be eaten; and the owner of the bull is free from punishment.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">But if a bull was formerly in the habit of goring and warning was served on its owner but he would not keep it under guard, and it did put a man or a woman to death, the bull is to be stoned and also its owner is to be put to death.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">If a ransom should be imposed upon him, then he must give the redemption price for his soul according to all that may be imposed upon him.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Whether it gored a son or gored a daughter, it is to be done to him according to this judicial decision.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">If it was a slave man or a slave girl that the bull gored, he will give the price of thirty shekels to that one’s master, and the bull will be stoned.</span>

       <span id="vs34">the owner of the pit is to make compensation. The price he is to return to its owner, and the dead animal will become his own.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>

       <span id="vs36">Or if it was known that a bull was in the habit of goring formerly but its owner would not keep it under guard, he should without fail make compensation with bull for bull, and the dead one will become his own.</span>

       <span id="vs8">So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people and said: “Here is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has concluded with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as respects all these words.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Moses and Aaron, Na&acute;dab and A&middot;bi&acute;hu and seventy of the older men of Israel proceeded to go up,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and they got to see the God of Israel. And under his feet there was what seemed like a work of sapphire flagstones and like the very heavens for purity.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And he did not put out his hand against the distinguished men of the sons of Israel, but they got a vision of the [true] God and ate and drank.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Come up to me in the mountain and stay there, as I want to give you the stone tablets and the law and the commandment that I must write in order to teach them.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So Moses and Joshua his minister got up and Moses went up into the mountain of the [true] God.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But to the older men he had said: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> wait for us in this place until we return to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. And, look! Aaron and Hur are with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>. Whoever has a case at law, let him approach them.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Thus Moses went up into the mountain while the cloud was covering the mountain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Jehovah’s glory continued to reside upon Mount Si&acute;nai, and the cloud continued to cover it for six days. At length on the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the sight of Jehovah’s glory was like a devouring fire on the mountaintop.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went on up the mountain. And Moses continued in the mountain forty days and forty nights.</span>

       <span id="vs27">And you must sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion that was waved and that was contributed from the ram of installation, from what was for Aaron and from what was for his sons.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And it must become Aaron’s and his sons’ by a regulation to time indefinite to be performed by the sons of Israel, because it is a sacred portion; and it will become a sacred portion to be rendered by the sons of Israel. From their communion sacrifices it is their sacred portion for Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“And the holy garments that are Aaron’s will serve for his sons after him to anoint them in them and to fill their hand with power in them.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Seven days the priest who succeeds him from among his sons and who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place will wear them.</span>

       <span id="vs33">And they must eat the things with which atonement has been made to fill their hand with power, in order to sanctify them. But a stranger may not eat them, because they are something holy.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And if any of the flesh of the installation sacrifice and of the bread should be left over until the morning, then you must burn what is left over with fire. It must not be eaten, because it is something holy.</span>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“And you must do this way to Aaron and his sons according to all that I have commanded you. You will take seven days to fill their hand with power.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And you will offer the bull of the sin offering daily for an atonement, and you must purify the altar from sin by your making atonement over it, and you must anoint it to sanctify it.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">You will take seven days to make atonement over the altar, and you must sanctify it that it may indeed become a most holy altar. Anyone who touches the altar is to be holy.</span>

       <span id="vs39">And you will offer the one young ram in the morning, and you will offer the other young ram between the two evenings.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And a tenth part of an e&acute;phah measure of fine flour moistened with the fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a drink offering of the fourth of a hin of wine, will go for the first young ram.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And you will offer the second young ram between the two evenings. With a grain offering like that of the morning and with a drink offering like its, you will render it as a restful odor, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">It is a constant burnt offering throughout <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I shall present myself to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people to speak to you there.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“And I will present myself there to the sons of Israel, and it will certainly be sanctified by my glory.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar; and I shall sanctify Aaron and his sons for them to act as priests to me.</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">And I will tabernacle in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will prove to be their God.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">And they will certainly know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt that I may tabernacle in the midst of them. I am Jehovah their God.</span>

       <span id="vs15">The rich should not give more, and the lowly must not give less than the half shekel, in order to give Jehovah’s contribution so as to make atonement for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And you must take the silver money of the atonement from the sons of Israel and give it in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting, that it may indeed serve as a memorial before Jehovah for the sons of Israel, to make atonement for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“You must make a basin of copper and its stand of copper for washing, and you must put it between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water into it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and their feet at it.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">When they go into the tent of meeting they will wash with water that they may not die, or when they go near the altar to minister in order to make an offering made by fire smoke to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And they must wash their hands and their feet that they may not die, and it must serve as a regulation to time indefinite for them, for him and his offspring throughout their generations.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“As for you, take to yourself the choicest perfumes: myrrh in congealed drops five hundred units, and sweet cinnamon in half that amount, two hundred and fifty units, and sweet calamus two hundred and fifty units,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and cassia five hundred units by the shekel of the holy place, and olive oil a hin.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Then you must make out of it a holy anointing oil, an ointment, a mixture that is the work of an ointment maker. It is to be a holy anointing oil.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“And you must anoint with it the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">and the table and all its utensils and the lampstand and its utensils and the altar of incense,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and the basin and its stand.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And you must sanctify them that they may indeed become most holy. Anyone touching them is to be holy.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And you will anoint Aaron and his sons, and you must sanctify them for acting as priests to me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“And you will speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘This is to continue as a holy anointing oil to me during <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> generations.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">It is not to be rubbed in the flesh of mankind, and with its composition <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not make any like it. It is something holy. It is to continue as something holy for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Anyone who makes an ointment like it and who puts some of it upon a stranger must be cut off from his people.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Take to yourself perfumes: stacte drops and onycha and perfumed galbanum and pure frankincense. There should be the same portion of each.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And you must make it into an incense, a spice mixture, the work of an ointment maker, salted, pure, something holy.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And you must pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting, where I shall present myself to you. It should be most holy to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And the incense that you will make with this composition, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must not make for yourselves. For you it is to continue as something holy to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off from his people.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Meanwhile the people got to see that Moses was taking a long time about coming down from the mountain. So the people congregated themselves about Aaron and said to him: “Get up, make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because as regards this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt, we certainly do not know what has happened to him.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">At this Aaron said to them: “Tear off the gold earrings that are in the ears of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons and of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters and bring them to me.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And all the people began tearing off the gold earrings that were in their ears and bringing them to Aaron.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Then he took [the gold] from their hands, and he formed it with a graving tool and proceeded to make it into a molten statue of a calf. And they began to say: “This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">When Aaron got to see this, he went to building an altar before it. Finally Aaron called out and said: “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So on the next day they were early in rising, and they began offering up burnt offerings and presenting communion sacrifices. After that the people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to have a good time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go, descend, because your people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt have acted ruinously.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">They have turned aside in a hurry from the way I have commanded them to go. They have made a molten statue of a calf for themselves and keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying, ‘This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.’”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “I have looked at this people and here it is a stiff-necked people.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So now let me be, that my anger may blaze against them and I may exterminate them, and let me make you into a great nation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Moses proceeded to soften the face of Jehovah his God and to say: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them among the mountains and to exterminate them from the surface of the ground’? Turn from your burning anger and feel regret over the evil against your people.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, in that you said to them, ‘I shall multiply <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> seed like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have designated I shall give to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> seed, that they may indeed take possession of it to time indefinite.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah began to feel regret over the evil that he had spoken of doing to his people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">After that Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, tablets written upon on both their sides. On this side and on that they were written upon.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved upon the tablets.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting, and he proceeded to say to Moses: “There is a noise of battle in the camp.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But he said:</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs18-2">“It is not the sound of the singing over mighty performance,<br><span class="z">And it is not the sound of the singing of defeat;</span><br><span class="z">It is the sound of other singing that I am hearing.”</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So it came about that as soon as he got near the camp and could see the calf and the dances, Moses’ anger began to blaze, and he at once threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he took the calf that they had made and he burnt it with fire and crushed it till it was fine, after which he scattered it upon the surface of the waters and made the sons of Israel drink it.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">After that Moses said to Aaron: “What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon it?”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">To this Aaron said: “Do not let the anger of my lord blaze. You yourself well know the people, that they are evil-inclined.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So they said to me, ‘Make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because as regards this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt, we certainly do not know what has happened to him.’</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Hence I said to them, ‘Who have any gold? They must tear it off themselves that they may give it to me.’ And I proceeded to throw it into the fire and this calf came on out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And Moses got to see that the people went unrestrained, because Aaron had let them go unrestrained for a disgrace among their opposers.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Then Moses took his stand in the gate of the camp and said: “Who is on Jehovah’s side? To me!” And all the sons of Le&acute;vi began gathering themselves to him.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He now said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Put each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> his sword on his side. Pass through and return from gate to gate in the camp and kill each one his brother and each one his fellow and each one his intimate acquaintance.’”</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And the sons of Le&acute;vi proceeded to do as Moses had said, so that there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And Moses went on to say: “Fill <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand today with power for Jehovah, because each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is against his own son and his own brother, and that he may confer a blessing upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> today.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">And it came about on the very next day that Moses proceeded to say to the people: “Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>—<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have sinned with a great sin, and now I shall go up to Jehovah. Perhaps I can make amends for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sin.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">So Moses returned to Jehovah and said: “Ah, but this people has sinned with a great sin, in that they made a god of gold for themselves!</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">But now if you will pardon their sin,—and if not, wipe me out, please, from your book that you have written.”</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">However, Jehovah said to Moses: “Whoever has sinned against me, I shall wipe him out of my book.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And now, come, lead the people to where I have spoken to you of. Look! My angel will go ahead of you, and on the day of my bringing punishment I shall certainly bring punishment upon them for their sin.”</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And Jehovah began plaguing the people because they had made the calf, which Aaron had made.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah said further to Moses: “Go, move up from here, you and the people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt, to the land about which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘To your seed I shall give it.’</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Ca&acute;naan&middot;ites, the Am&acute;or&middot;ites, and the Hit&acute;tites and the Per&acute;iz&middot;zites, the Hi&acute;vites and the Jeb&acute;u&middot;sites;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">to a land flowing with milk and honey, for I shall not go up in the midst of you, because you are a stiff-necked people, that I may not exterminate you on the way.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">When the people got to hear this evil word, they began to mourn; and none of them put his ornaments on himself.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> are a stiff-necked people. In one moment I could go up into the midst of you and certainly exterminate you. So now put down your ornaments off yourself, as I want to know what I am going to do to you.’”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the sons of Israel went stripping their ornaments off themselves from Mount Ho&acute;reb onward.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As for Moses, he proceeded to take his tent away and he pitched it outside the camp, far away from the camp; and he called it a tent of meeting. And it occurred that everyone inquiring of Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And it occurred that as soon as Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise, and they stationed themselves each one at the entrance of his own tent, and they gazed after Moses until he went into the tent.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">It also occurred that as soon as Moses had gone into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down, and it stood at the entrance of the tent and he spoke with Moses.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, and all the people rose and bowed down each one at the entrance of his own tent.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, just as a man would speak to his fellow. When he returned to the camp, his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, as attendant, would not withdraw from the midst of the tent.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now Moses said to Jehovah: “See, you are saying to me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but you yourself have not let me know whom you will send with me. Moreover, you yourself have said, ‘I do know you by name and, besides, you have found favor in my eyes.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And now, if, please, I have found favor in your eyes, make me know, please, your ways, that I may know you, in order that I may find favor in your eyes. And consider that this nation is your people.”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">So he said: “My own person will go along and I shall certainly give you rest.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this he said to him: “If your own person is not going along, do not lead us up from here.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And by what, now, will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going along with us, in that I and your people have been made distinct from all the other people who are upon the surface of the ground?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “This thing, too, of which you have spoken, I shall do, because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by name.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">At this he said: “Cause me to see, please, your glory.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But he said: “I myself shall cause all my goodness to pass before your face, and I will declare the name of Jehovah before you; and I will favor the one whom I may favor, and I will show mercy to the one to whom I may show mercy.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And he added: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Jehovah said further: “Here is a place with me, and you must station yourself upon the rock.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And it has to occur that while my glory is passing by I must place you in a hole in the rock, and I must put my palm over you as a screen until I have passed by.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">After that I must take my palm away, and you will indeed see my back. But my face may not be seen.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">And get ready for the morning, as you must go up in the morning into Mount Si&acute;nai and station yourself by me there on the top of the mountain.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Accordingly Moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went on up into Mount Si&acute;nai, just as Jehovah had commanded him, and he was taking the two tablets of stone in his hand.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Moses at once hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then he said: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, O Jehovah, let Jehovah, please, go along in the midst of us, because it is a stiff-necked people, and you have to forgive our error and our sin, and you must take us as your possession.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In turn he said: “Here I am concluding a covenant: Before all your people I shall do wonderful things that have never been created in all the earth or among all the nations; and all the people in the midst of whom you are will indeed see the work of Jehovah, because it is a fear-inspiring thing that I am doing with you.</span>

       <span id="vs15">for fear that you may conclude a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, as they will certainly have immoral intercourse with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone will be certain to invite you, and you will certainly eat some of his sacrifice.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then you will have to take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will be certain to have immoral intercourse with their gods and make your sons have immoral intercourse with their gods.</span>

       <span id="vs28">And he continued there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. He ate no bread and he drank no water. And he proceeded to write upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words.</span>

       <span id="vs22">And they kept coming, the men along with the women, every willing-hearted one.

       <span id="vs26">And all the women whose hearts impelled them with wisdom spun the goat’s hair.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">“And Bez&acute;al&middot;el must work, also O&middot;ho&acute;li&middot;ab and every wise-hearted man to whom Jehovah has given wisdom and understanding in these things in order to know how to do all the work of the holy service according to all that Jehovah has commanded.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And Moses proceeded to call Bez&acute;al&middot;el and O&middot;ho&acute;li&middot;ab and every wise-hearted man into whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, everyone whose heart impelled him to approach the work in order to do it.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then they took from before Moses all the contribution that the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the holy service so as to do it, and, as for the latter, they still brought to him a voluntary offering morning after morning.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And all the wise ones who were doing all the holy work began to come, one man after another, from their work that they were doing,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and to say to Moses: “The people are bringing much more than what the service needs for the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Moses commanded that they should cause an announcement to pass through the camp, saying: “Men and women, do not produce any more stuff for the holy contribution.” With that the people were restrained from bringing it in.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the stuff proved to be enough for all the work to be done, and more than enough.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And all the wise-hearted among those doing the work went making the tabernacle, the ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen and blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material; with cherubs, the work of an embroiderer, he made them.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The length of each tent cloth was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each tent cloth four cubits. There was one measure for all the tent cloths.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then he joined five tent cloths one to another, and the five other tent cloths he joined one to another.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">After that he made loops of blue thread upon the edge of the one tent cloth at the junction end. He did the same on the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the other place of junction.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">He made fifty loops on the one tent cloth, and he made fifty loops on the extremity of the tent cloth that was at the other place of junction, the loops being opposite one another.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Finally he made fifty hooks of gold and joined the tent cloths to one another by the hooks, so that it became one tabernacle.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And he went on to make tent cloths of goat’s hair for the tent upon the tabernacle. Eleven tent cloths were what he made.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">The length of each tent cloth was thirty cubits, and the width of each tent cloth four cubits. There was one measure for the eleven tent cloths.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then he joined five tent cloths together by themselves and the six other tent cloths by themselves.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Next he made fifty loops upon the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the place of junction, and he made fifty loops upon the edge of the other tent cloth that joined with it.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">After that he made fifty hooks of copper for joining the tent together to become one piece.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And he proceeded to make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and a covering out of sealskins up on top.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then he made the panel frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood, standing on end.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Ten cubits was the length of a panel frame, and one cubit and a half the width of each panel frame.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Each panel frame had two tenons fitted one to the other. That is the way he did to all the panel frames of the tabernacle.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">So he made the panel frames for the tabernacle, twenty panel frames for the side toward the Neg&acute;eb, to the south.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And he made forty socket pedestals of silver for beneath the twenty panel frames, two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame with its two tenons and two socket pedestals beneath the other panel frame with its two tenons.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And for the other side of the tabernacle, the northern side, he made twenty panel frames</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">and their forty socket pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame and two socket pedestals beneath the other panel frame.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And for the rear sections of the tabernacle to the west he made six panel frames.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And he made two panel frames as corner posts of the tabernacle on its two rear sections.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And they proved to be duplicates at the bottom and together they came to be twins to the top of each one at the first ring. That is what he did to them both, to the two corner posts.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">So they amounted to eight panel frames and their socket pedestals of silver to sixteen, two socket pedestals next to two socket pedestals beneath each panel frame.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>

       <span id="vs7">He further made two cherubs of gold. Of hammered work he made them on both ends of the cover.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">One cherub was on the end over there, and the other cherub on the end over here. He made the cherubs on the cover on both of its ends.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs19">Three cups shaped like flowers of almond were on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating; and three cups shaped like flowers of almond were on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating.

       <span id="vs20">And on the lampstand there were four cups shaped like flowers of almond, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And the knob under two branches was out of it, and the knob under two other branches was out of it, and the knob under two more branches was out of it, for the six branches running out from the lampstand.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Their knobs and their branches proceeded out from it. All of it was one piece of hammered work, of pure gold.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its fire holders out of pure gold.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Of a talent of pure gold he made it and all its utensils.</span>

       <span id="vs26">Then he overlaid it with pure gold, its top surface and its sides round about and its horns, and he made a border of gold round about for it.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And he made for it two rings of gold down below its border upon two of its sides, upon two opposite sides of it, as supports for the poles with which to carry it.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And out of the blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material they made garments of knitted work for ministering in the holy place. So they made the holy garments that were for Aaron, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Accordingly he made the eph&acute;od of gold, blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Then they beat plates of gold to thin sheets, and he cut out threads to work in among the blue thread and the wool dyed reddish purple and the coccus scarlet material and the fine linen, as the work of an embroiderer.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">They made shoulder pieces for it that were joined. It was joined at its two extremities.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And the girdle, which was upon it for tying it close, was of the same material according to its workmanship, of gold, blue thread, and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then they made the onyx stones set with settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a seal according to the names of the sons of Israel.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">So he placed them upon the shoulder pieces of the eph&acute;od as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then he made the breastpiece with the workmanship of an embroiderer, like the workmanship of the eph&acute;od, out of gold, blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">It proved to be foursquare when doubled. They made the breastpiece, when doubled, a span of the hand in its length and a span in its width.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then they filled it with four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz and emerald was the first row.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the second row was turquoise, sapphire and jasper.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the third row was <i>lesh&acute;em</i> stone, agate and amethyst.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the fourth row was chrys&acute;o&middot;lite and onyx and jade. They were set with settings of gold in their fillings.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And the stones were according to the names of the sons of Israel. They were twelve according to their names, with the engravings of a seal, each according to its name for the twelve tribes.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And they proceeded to make upon the breastpiece wreathed chains, in ropework, of pure gold.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then they made two settings of gold and two rings of gold and put the two rings upon the two extremities of the breastpiece.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">After that they put the two ropes of gold through the two rings at the extremities of the breastpiece.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And they put the two ends of the two ropes through the two settings. Then they put them upon the shoulder pieces of the eph&acute;od, at the forefront of it.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Next they made two rings of gold and set them at the two extremities of the breastpiece upon its edge that is on the side toward the eph&acute;od inward.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then they made two rings of gold and put them upon the two shoulder pieces of the eph&acute;od from below, on its forefront, near its place of joining, above the girdle of the eph&acute;od.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Finally they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the eph&acute;od with a blue string, that it might continue above the girdle of the eph&acute;od and the breastpiece might not get displaced from on top the eph&acute;od, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Then he made the sleeveless coat of the eph&acute;od, the workmanship of a loom worker, all of blue thread.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the opening of the sleeveless coat was in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail. Its opening had a border round about that it might not be torn.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then they made upon the hem of the sleeveless coat pomegranates of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material, twisted together.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Further, they made bells of pure gold and put the bells in between the pomegranates upon the hem of the sleeveless coat round about, in between the pomegranates;</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate upon the hem of the sleeveless coat round about, for ministering, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Next they made the robes of fine linen, the workmanship of a loom worker, for Aaron and his sons,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">and the turban of fine linen and the ornamental headgears of fine linen and the linen drawers of fine twisted linen,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">and the sash of fine twisted linen and blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material, the work of a weaver, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Finally they made the shining plate, the holy sign of dedication, out of pure gold and inscribed upon it an inscription with the engravings of a seal: “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">Then they put a string of blue thread to it in order to put it upon the turban up above, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">So the work for the tabernacle of the tent of meeting all came to its completion, in that the sons of Israel kept doing according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And they proceeded to bring the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its panel frames, its bars and its pillars and its socket pedestals,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">and its covering of ram skins dyed red and its covering of sealskins and the curtain of the screen,</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">and the ark of the testimony and its poles and the cover,</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">the table, all its utensils and the showbread,</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps, the row of lamps, and all its utensils and the oil of illumination,</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and the altar of gold and the anointing oil and the perfumed incense and the screen for the entrance of the tent,</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">the altar of copper and the grating of copper that belonged to it, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its stand,</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals and the screen for the gate of the courtyard, its tent cords and its tent pins and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting,</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, that was the way the sons of Israel did all the service.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And Moses got to see all the work, and, look! they had done it just as Jehovah had commanded. That was the way they had done. Consequently Moses blessed them.</span>

       <span id="vs2">“On the day of the first month, on the first of the month, you are to set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you must place the ark of the testimony in it and shut off approach to the Ark with the curtain.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you must bring the table in and set its arrangement in order, and you must bring in the lampstand and light up its lamps.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And you must put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony and put the screen of the entrance for the tabernacle in place.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“And you must put the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">and you must put the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And you must place the courtyard round about and put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And you must take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and you must sanctify it and all its utensils, and so it must become something holy.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And you must anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and sanctify the altar, and so it must become a most holy altar.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And you must anoint the basin and its stand and sanctify it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Then you must bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And you must clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him, and so he must act as priest to me.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">After that you will bring his sons near and you must clothe them with robes.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And you must anoint them just as you anointed their father, and so they must act as priests to me, and their anointing must serve continually for them as a priesthood to time indefinite during their generations.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Accordingly it came about that in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">When Moses proceeded to set up the tabernacle, he went putting its socket pedestals down and placing its panel frames and putting its bars in and setting up its pillars.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent above upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">After that he took the Testimony and put it into the Ark and placed the poles on the Ark and put the cover above upon the Ark.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Then he brought the Ark into the tabernacle and put the curtain of the screen in place and shut off approach to the ark of the testimony, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Next he put the table in the tent of meeting on the side of the tabernacle to the north outside the curtain,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and he arranged the row of bread upon it before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting in front of the table, on the side of the tabernacle to the south.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">He then lit up the lamps before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">He next placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">that he might make perfumed incense smoke upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Finally he put the screen of the entrance of the tabernacle in place.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, that he might offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering upon it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then he placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet at it.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">When they went into the tent of meeting and when they went near to the altar they would wash, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">Finally he set up the courtyard round about the tabernacle and the altar and put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs33-2">So Moses finished the work.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">And Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting, because the cloud resided over it and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And when the cloud lifted itself up from over the tabernacle the sons of Israel would break camp during all their stages of journey.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">However, if the cloud did not lift itself up, then they would not break camp until the day when it lifted itself up.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">For Jehovah’s cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and a fire continued upon it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their stages of journey.</span>
