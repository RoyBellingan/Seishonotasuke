       <span id="vs1">God, who long ago spoke on many occasions and in many ways to our forefathers by means of the prophets,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">He is the reflection of [his] glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power; and after he had made a purification for our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in lofty places.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">So he has become better than the angels, to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For example, to which one of the angels did he ever say: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father”? And again: “I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son”?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all God’s angels do obeisance to him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Also, with reference to the angels he says: “And he makes his angels spirits, and his public servants a flame of fire.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But with reference to the Son: “God is your throne forever and ever, and [the] scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with [the] oil of exultation more than your partners.”</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And: “You at [the] beginning, O Lord, laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are [the] works of your hands.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">They themselves will perish, but you yourself are to remain continually; and just like an outer garment they will all grow old,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as an outer garment; and they will be changed, but you are the same, and your years will never run out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">But with reference to which one of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?</span>

<p class="title">Hebrews 2:1-18</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="13">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="18">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For if the word spoken through angels proved to be firm, and every transgression and disobedient act received a retribution in harmony with justice;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">how shall we escape if we have neglected a salvation of such greatness in that it began to be spoken through [our] Lord and was verified for us by those who heard him,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">while God joined in bearing witness with signs as well as portents and various powerful works and with distributions of holy spirit according to his will?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come, about which we are speaking.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But a certain witness has given proof somewhere, saying: “What is man that you keep him in mind, or [the] son of man that you take care of him?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">You made him a little lower than angels; with glory and honor you crowned him, and appointed him over the works of your hands.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">All things you subjected under his feet.” For in that he subjected all things to him [God] left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every [man].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For it was fitting for the one for whose sake all things are and through whom all things are, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For both he who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all [stem] from one, and for this cause he is not ashamed to call them “brothers,”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">as he says: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of [the] congregation I will praise you with song.”</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And again: “I will have my trust in him.” And again: “Look! I and the young children, whom Jehovah gave me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">and [that] he might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through their lives.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For he is really not assisting angels at all, but he is assisting Abraham’s seed.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Consequently he was obliged to become like his “brothers” in all respects, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For in that he himself has suffered when being put to the test, he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest whom we confess—Jesus.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">He was faithful to the One that made him such, as Moses was also in all the house of that One.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For the latter is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who constructs it has more honor than the house.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And Moses as an attendant was faithful in all the house of that One as a testimony of the things that were to be spoken afterwards,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but Christ [was faithful] as a Son over the house of that One. We are the house of that One, if we make fast our hold on our freeness of speech and our boasting over the hope firm to the end.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For this reason, just as the holy spirit says: “Today if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people listen to his own voice,</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">do not harden <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger, as in the day of making the test in the wilderness,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">in which <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers made a test of me with a trial, and yet they had seen my works for forty years.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For this reason I became disgusted with this generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they themselves have not come to know my ways.’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter into my rest.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">but keep on exhorting one another each day, as long as it may be called “Today,” for fear any one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we make fast our hold on the confidence we had at the beginning firm to the end,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">while it is being said: “Today if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people listen to his own voice, do not harden <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For who were they that heard and yet provoked to bitter anger? Did not, in fact, all do so who went out of Egypt under Moses?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Moreover, with whom did [God] become disgusted for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest except to those who acted disobediently?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="16">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Therefore, since a promise is left of entering into his rest, let us fear that sometime someone of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may seem to have fallen short of it.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For we have had the good news declared to us also, even as they also had; but the word which was heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who did hear.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and again in this place: “They shall not enter into my rest.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Since, therefore, it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">he again marks off a certain day by saying after so long a time in David’s [psalm] “Today”; just as it has been said above: “Today if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people listen to his own voice, do not harden <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, [God] would not afterward have spoken of another day.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For the man that has entered into [God’s] rest has also himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, for fear anyone should fall in the same pattern of disobedience.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and [their] marrow, and [is] able to discern thoughts and intentions of [the] heart.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And there is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Seeing, therefore, that we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold onto [our] confessing of [him].</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For we have as high priest, not one who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in all respects like ourselves, but without sin.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Let us, therefore, approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness, that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time.</span>

       <span id="vs2">He is able to deal moderately with the ignorant and erring ones since he also is surrounded with his own weakness,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>

</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Also, a man takes this honor, not of his own accord, but only when he is called by God, just as Aaron also [was].</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So too the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but [was glorified by him] who spoke with reference to him: “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Just as he says also in another place: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek.”</span>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">In the days of his flesh [Christ] offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death, with strong outcries and tears, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>

       <span id="vs12">For, indeed, although <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> ought to be teachers in view of the time, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> again need someone to teach <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have become such as need milk, not solid food.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For this reason, now that we have left the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works, and faith toward God,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And this we will do, if God indeed permits.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For it is impossible as regards those who have once for all been enlightened, and who have tasted the heavenly free gift, and who have become partakers of holy spirit,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but who have fallen away, to revive them again to repentance, because they impale the Son of God afresh for themselves and expose him to public shame.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For example, the ground that drinks in the rain which often comes upon it, and that then brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whom it is also cultivated, receives in return a blessing from God.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed; and it ends up with being burned.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">However, in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things and things accompanied with salvation, although we are speaking in this way.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For God is not unrighteous so as to forget <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> work and the love <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> showed for his name, in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But we desire each one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">saying: “Assuredly in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And thus after [Abraham] had shown patience, he obtained [this] promise.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For men swear by the one greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, as it is a legal guarantee to them.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In this manner God, when he purposed to demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, stepped in with an oath,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">in order that, through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to lay hold on the hope set before us.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">This [hope] we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, Jesus, who has become a high priest according to the manner of Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek forever.</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="13">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="28">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For this Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek, king of Sa&acute;lem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">and to whom Abraham apportioned a tenth from all things, is first of all, by translation, “King of Righteousness,” and is then also king of Sa&acute;lem, that is, “King of Peace.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">B<span class="smallcaps">EHOLD</span>, then, how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">True, the men from the sons of Le&acute;vi who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, even if these have issued from the loins of Abraham;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">but the man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And in the one case it is men who are dying that receive tithes, but in the other case it is someone of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And, if I may use the expression, through Abraham even Le&acute;vi who receives tithes has paid tithes,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">for he was still in the loins of his forefather when Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek met him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">If, then, perfection were really through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it as a feature the people were given the Law,) what further need would there be for another priest to arise according to the manner of Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek and not said to be according to the manner of Aaron?</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For the man respecting whom these things are said has been a member of another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For it is quite plain that our Lord has sprung up out of Judah, a tribe about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it is still more abundantly clear that with a similarity to Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek there arises another priest,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment depending upon the flesh, but according to the power of an indestructible life,</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">for in witness it is said: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Mel&middot;chiz&acute;e&middot;dek.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Certainly, then, there occurs a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and ineffectiveness.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in besides of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Also, to the extent that it was not without a sworn oath,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">(for there are indeed men that have become priests without a sworn oath, but there is one with an oath sworn by the One who said respecting him: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret), ‘You are a priest forever,’”)</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">to that extent also Jesus has become the one given in pledge of a better covenant.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Furthermore, many had to become priests [in succession] because of being prevented by death from continuing as such,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">but he because of continuing alive forever has his priesthood without any successors.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Consequently he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For such a high priest as this was suitable for us, loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">He does not need daily, as those high priests do, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for those of the people: (for this he did once for all time when he offered himself up;)</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">for the Law appoints men high priests having weakness, but the word of the sworn oath that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is perfected forever.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Now as to the things being discussed this is the main point: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">a public servant of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah put up, and not man.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">If, now, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being [men] who offer the gifts according to the Law,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">but which [men] are rendering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to make the tent in completion, was given the divine command: For says he: “See that you make all things after [their] pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But now [Jesus] has obtained a more excellent public service, so that he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established upon better promises.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">for he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! There are days coming,’ says Jehovah, ‘and I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">not according to the covenant that I made with their forefathers in [the] day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“‘For this is the covenant that I shall covenant with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I shall write them. And I will become their God, and they themselves will become my people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“‘And they will by no means teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” For they will all know me, from [the] least one to [the] greatest one of them.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For I shall be merciful to their unrighteous deeds, and I shall by no means call their sins to mind anymore.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In his saying “a new [covenant]” he has made the former one obsolete. Now that which is made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For its part, then, the former [covenant] used to have ordinances of sacred service and [its] mundane holy place.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For there was constructed a first tent [compartment] in which were the lampstand and also the table and the display of the loaves; and it is called “the Holy Place.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But behind the second curtain was the tent [compartment] called “the Most Holy.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">This had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which were the golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">but up above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory [cover]. But now is not the time to speak in detail concerning these things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">After these things had been constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent [compartment] at all times to perform the sacred services;</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">but into the second [compartment] the high priest alone enters once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Thus the holy spirit makes it plain that the way into the holy place had not yet been made manifest while the first tent was standing.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">This very [tent] is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here, and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the [man] doing sacred service perfect as respects his conscience,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">but have to do only with foods and drinks and various baptisms. They were legal requirements pertaining to the flesh and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">However, when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come to pass, through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">he entered, no, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time into the holy place and obtained an everlasting deliverance [for us].</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies to the extent of cleanness of the flesh,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to [the] living God?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">So that is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has occurred for [their] release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, the ones who have been called might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For where there is a covenant, the death of the [human] covenanter needs to be furnished.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For a covenant is valid over dead [victims], since it is not in force at any time while the [human] covenanter is living.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Consequently neither was the former [covenant] inaugurated without blood.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For when every commandment according to the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled the book itself and all the people,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">saying: “This is the blood of the covenant that God has laid as a charge upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the public service likewise with the blood.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Yes, nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Therefore it was necessary that the typical representations of the things in the heavens should be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices that are better than such sacrifices.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Neither is it in order that he should offer himself often, as indeed the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood not his own.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to put sin away through the sacrifice of himself.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin and to those earnestly looking for him for [their] salvation.</span>

<p class="title">Hebrews 10:1-39</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="13">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="39">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, [men] can never with the same sacrifices from year to year which they offer continually make those who approach perfect.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Otherwise, would the [sacrifices] not have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service who had been cleansed once for all time would have no consciousness of sins anymore?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">To the contrary, by these sacrifices there is a reminding of sins from year to year,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Hence when he comes into the world he says: “‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin [offering].’</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin [offering]”—[sacrifices] that are offered according to the Law—</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">then he actually says: “Look! I am come to do your will.” He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">By the said “will” we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Also, every priest takes his station from day to day to render public service and to offer the same sacrifices often, as these are at no time able to take sins away completely.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But this [man] offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually and sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">from then on awaiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For it is by one [sacrificial] offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect perpetually.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“‘This is the covenant that I shall covenant toward them after those days,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I shall write them,’”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">[it says afterwards:] “And I shall by no means call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind anymore.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">which he inaugurated for us as a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience and our bodies bathed with clean water.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> behold the day drawing near.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">but [there is] a certain fearful expectation of judgment and [there is] a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Of how much more severe a punishment, do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">For we know him that said: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense”; and again: “Jehovah will judge his people.”</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of [the] living God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">However, keep on remembering the former days in which, after <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were enlightened, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> endured a great contest under sufferings,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">sometimes while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were being exposed as in a theater both to reproaches and tribulations, and sometimes while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> became sharers with those who were having such an experience.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> both expressed sympathy for those in prison and joyfully took the plundering of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> belongings, knowing <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves have a better and an abiding possession.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Do not, therefore, throw away <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> freeness of speech, which has a great reward to be paid it.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have need of endurance, in order that, after <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have done the will of God, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may receive the [fulfillment of the] promise.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">For yet “a very little while,” and “he who is coming will arrive and will not delay.”</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,” and, “if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.</span>

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="40">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">By faith we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God’s word, so that what is beheld has come to be out of things that do not appear.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than Cain, through which [faith] he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness respecting his gifts; and through it he, although he died, yet speaks.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">By faith E&acute;noch was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him; for before his transference he had the witness that he had pleased God well.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please [him] well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">By faith Noah, after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this [faith] he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">By faith he resided as an alien in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, and dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and maker of which [city] is God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">By faith also Sarah herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past the age limit, since she esteemed him faithful who had promised.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Hence also from one [man], and him as good as dead, there were born [children] just as the stars of heaven for multitude and as the sands that are by the seaside, innumerable.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">In faith all these died, although they did not get the [fulfillment of the] promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">For those who say such things give evidence that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that [place] from which they had gone forth, they would have had opportunity to return.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But now they are reaching out for a better [place], that is, one belonging to heaven. Hence God is not ashamed of them, to be called upon as their God, for he has made a city ready for them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up [his] only-begotten [son],</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">although it had been said to him: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and E&acute;sau concerning things to come.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">By faith Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning upon the top of his staff.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel; and he gave a command concerning his bones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">By faith Moses was hid for three months by his parents after his birth, because they saw the young child was beautiful and they did not fear the order of the king.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Phar&acute;aoh,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">By faith he had celebrated the passover and the splashing of the blood, that the destroyer might not touch their firstborn ones.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but on venturing out upon it the Egyptians were swallowed up.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">By faith the walls of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">By faith Ra&acute;hab the harlot did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And what more shall I say? For the time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gid&acute;e&middot;on, Ba&acute;rak, Samson, Jeph&acute;thah, David as well as Samuel and the [other] prophets,</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">who through faith defeated kingdoms in conflict, effected righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">stayed the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from a weak state were made powerful, became valiant in war, routed the armies of foreigners.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Women received their dead by resurrection; but other [men] were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by bonds and prisons.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn asunder, they died by slaughter with the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while they were in want, in tribulation, under ill-treatment;</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves and dens of the earth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And yet all these, although they had witness borne to them through their faith, did not get the [fulfillment of the] promise,</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">as God foresaw something better for us, in order that they might not be made perfect apart from us.</span>

<p class="title">Hebrews 12:1-29</p>
<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="13">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="29">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">So, then, because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">as we look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may not get tired and give out in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">In carrying on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> contest against that sin <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have never yet resisted as far as blood,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have entirely forgotten the exhortation which addresses <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as sons: “My son, do not belittle [the] discipline from Jehovah, neither give out when you are corrected by him;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">for whom Jehovah loves he disciplines; in fact, he scourges every one whom he receives as a son.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It is for discipline <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are enduring. God is dealing with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> as with sons. For what son is he that a father does not discipline?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are without the discipline of which all have become partakers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are really illegitimate children, and not sons.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Furthermore, we used to have fathers who were of our flesh to discipline us, and we used to give them respect. Shall we not much more subject ourselves to the Father of our spiritual life and live?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For they for a few days used to discipline us according to what seemed good to them, but he does so for our profit that we may partake of his holiness.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Hence straighten up the hands that hang down and the enfeebled knees,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">and keep making straight paths for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather that it may be healed.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Pursue peace with all people, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">carefully watching that no one may be deprived of the undeserved kindness of God; that no poisonous root may spring up and cause trouble and that many may not be defiled by it;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">that there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things, like E&acute;sau, who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know that afterward also when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for, although he earnestly sought a change of mind with tears, he found no place for it.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not approached that which can be felt and which has been set aflame with fire, and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a tempest,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and the blare of a trumpet and the voice of words; on hearing which voice the people implored that no word should be added to them.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For the command was not bearable to them: “And if a beast touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Also, the display was so fearsome that Moses said: “I am fearful and trembling.”</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have approached a Mount Zion and a city of [the] living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect,</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, which speaks in a better way than Abel’s [blood].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">See that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not beg off from him who is speaking. For if they did not escape who begged off from him who was giving divine warning upon earth, much more shall we not if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying: “Yet once more I will set in commotion not only the earth but also the heaven.”</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Now the expression “Yet once more” signifies the removal of the things being shaken as things that have been made, in order that the things not being shaken may remain.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Wherefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">For our God is also a consuming fire.</span>

       <span id="vs3">Keep in mind those in prison bonds as though <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have been bound with them, and those being ill-treated, since <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves also are still in a body.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Let [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] manner of life be free of the love of money, while <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are content with the present things.

       <span id="vs19">But I exhort <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> more especially to do this, that I may be restored to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the sooner.</span>
