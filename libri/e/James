<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="27">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">James, a slave of God and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes that are scattered about:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-2">Greetings!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Consider it all joy, my brothers, when <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> meet with various trials,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">knowing as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do that this tested quality of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith works out endurance.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">But let endurance have its work complete, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So, if any one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching; and it will be given him.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But let him keep on asking in faith, not doubting at all, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">In fact, let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from Jehovah;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">he is an indecisive man, unsteady in all his ways.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But let the lowly brother exult over his exaltation,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and the rich one over his humiliation, because like a flower of the vegetation he will pass away.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For the sun rises with its burning heat and withers the vegetation, and its flower drops off and the beauty of its outward appearance perishes. So, too, the rich man will fade away in his ways of life.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Do not be misled, my beloved brothers.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the [celestial] lights, and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Because he willed it, he brought us forth by the word of truth, for us to be certain firstfruits of his creatures.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath;</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">for man’s wrath does not work out God’s righteousness.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">However, become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">For he looks at himself, and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">But he who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in [it], this [man], because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, will be happy in his doing [it].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this man’s form of worship is futile.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">My brothers, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are not holding the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, our glory, with acts of favoritism, are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">For, if a man with gold rings on his fingers and in splendid clothing enters into a gathering of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but a poor [man] in filthy clothing also enters,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">yet <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> look with favor upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say: “You take this seat here in a fine place,” and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say to the poor one: “You keep standing,” or: “Take that seat there under my footstool,”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4"><span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have class distinctions among yourselves and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have become judges rendering wicked decisions, is that not so?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Listen, my beloved brothers. God chose the ones who are poor respecting the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him, did he not?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span>, though, have dishonored the poor [man]. The rich oppress <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and they drag <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> before law courts, do they not?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">They blaspheme the fine name by which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> were called, do they not?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">If, now, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> practice carrying out the kingly law according to the scripture: “You must love your neighbor as yourself,” <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are doing quite well.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> continue showing favoritism, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are working a sin, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are reproved by the law as transgressors.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For whoever observes all the Law but makes a false step in one point, he has become an offender against them all.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For he who said: “You must not commit adultery,” said also: “You must not murder.” If, now, you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of law.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Keep on speaking in such a way and keep on doing in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For the one that does not practice mercy will have [his] judgment without mercy. Mercy exults triumphantly over judgment.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if a certain one says he has faith but he does not have works? That faith cannot save him, can it?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">If a brother or a sister is in a naked state and lacking the food sufficient for the day,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">yet a certain one of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> says to them: “Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,” but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not give them the necessities for [their] body, of what benefit is it?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Thus, too, faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Nevertheless, a certain one will say: “You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith apart from the works, and I shall show you my faith by my works.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">You believe there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But do you care to know, O empty man, that faith apart from works is inactive?</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Was not Abraham our father declared righteous by works after he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">You behold that [his] faith worked along with his works and by [his] works [his] faith was perfected,</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">and the scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he came to be called “Jehovah’s friend.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> see that a man is to be declared righteous by works, and not by faith alone.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">In the same manner was not also Ra&acute;hab the harlot declared righteous by works, after she had received the messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way?</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Indeed, as the body without spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</span>

       <span id="vs6">Well, the tongue is a fire. The tongue is constituted a world of unrighteousness among our members, for it spots up all the body and sets the wheel of natural life aflame and it is set aflame by Ge&middot;hen&acute;na.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs12">My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives or a vine figs, can it? Neither can salt water produce sweet water.</span>

       <span id="vs15">This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is [the] earthly, animal, demonic.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">For where jealousy and contentiousness are, there disorder and every vile thing are.</span>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But the wisdom from above is first of all chaste, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, not making partial distinctions, not hypocritical.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Moreover, the fruit of righteousness has its seed sown under peaceful conditions for those who are making peace.</span>
