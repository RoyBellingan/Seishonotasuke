</p>

       <span id="vs3">For, look! Jehovah is going forth from his place, and he will certainly come down and tread upon earth’s high places.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the mountains must melt under him, and the low plains themselves will split apart, like wax because of the fire, like waters being poured down a steep place.</span>

       <span id="vs5">“It is because of the revolt of Jacob that there is all this, even because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is the revolt of Jacob? Is it not Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I shall certainly make Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a a heap of ruins of the field, the planting places of a vineyard; and I will pour down into the valley her stones, and her foundations I shall lay bare.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And her graven images will all be crushed to pieces, and all the gifts [made] to her as her hire will be burned in the fire; and all her idols I shall make a desolate waste.

       <span id="vs15">The dispossessor I shall yet bring to you, O inhabitress of Ma&middot;re&acute;shah. As far as A&middot;dul&acute;lam the glory of Israel will come.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>

       <span id="vs1">And it must occur in the final part of the days [that] the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, and it will certainly be lifted up above the hills; and to it peoples must stream.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And many nations will certainly go and say: “Come, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For out of Zion law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And he will certainly render judgment among many peoples, and set matters straight respecting mighty nations far away. And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And they will actually sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and there will be no one making [them] tremble; for the very mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken [it].</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For all the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.</span>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

       <span id="vs7">And I shall certainly make her that was limping a remnant, and her that was removed far off a mighty nation; and Jehovah will actually rule as king over them in Mount Zion, from now on and into time indefinite.</span>

       <span id="vs8">“And as for you, O tower of the drove, the mound of the daughter of Zion, as far as to you it will come, yes, the first dominion will certainly come, the kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem.</span>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Now why is it that you keep shouting loudly? Is there no king in you, or has your own counselor perished, so that pangs like those of a woman giving birth have grabbed hold of you?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Be in severe pains and burst forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman giving birth, for now you will go forth from a town, and you will have to reside in the field. And you will have to come as far as to Babylon. There you will be delivered. There Jehovah will buy you back out of the palm of your enemies.</span>

       <span id="vs12">But as for them, they have not come to know the thoughts of Jehovah, and they have not come to understand his counsel; because he will certainly collect them together like a row of newly cut grain to the threshing floor.</span>

       <span id="vs13">“Get up and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for your horn I shall change into iron, and your hoofs I shall change into copper, and you will certainly pulverize many peoples; and by a ban you will actually devote to Jehovah their unjust profit, and their resources to the [true] Lord of the whole earth.”</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="7">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="20">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Too bad for me, for I have become like the gatherings of summer fruit, like the gleaning of a grape gathering! There is no grape cluster to eat, no early fig, that my soul would desire!</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">The loyal one has perished from the earth, and among mankind there is no upright one. All of them, for bloodshed they lie in wait. They hunt, everyone his own brother, with a dragnet.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">[Their] hands are upon what is bad, to do [it] well; the prince is asking [for something], and the one who is judging [does so] for the reward, and the great one is speaking forth the craving of his soul, his very own; and they interweave it.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Their best one is like a brier, [their] most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, [of] your being given attention, must come. Now will occur the confounding of them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Do not put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith in a companion. Do not put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trust in a confidential friend. From her who is lying in your bosom guard the openings of your mouth.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For a son is despising a father; a daughter is rising up against her mother; a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his household.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But as for me, it is for Jehovah that I shall keep on the lookout. I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Do not rejoice over me, O you woman enemy of mine. Although I have fallen, I shall certainly rise up; although I dwell in the darkness, Jehovah will be a light to me.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The raging of Jehovah I shall bear—for I have sinned against him—until he conducts my legal case and actually executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I shall look upon his righteousness.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And my enemy will see, and shame will cover her, who was saying to me: “Where is he, Jehovah your God?” My own eyes will look upon her. Now she will become a place of trampling, like the mire of streets.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">The day for building your stone walls, at that day [the] decree will be far away.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that day even all the way to you they will come from As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even all the way to [the] River; and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to the mountain.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the land must become a desolate waste on account of its inhabitants, because of the fruit of their dealings.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, the one who was residing alone in a forest—in the midst of an orchard. Let them feed on Ba&acute;shan and Gil&acute;e&middot;ad as in the days of a long time ago.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“As in the days of your coming forth from the land of Egypt I shall show him wonderful things.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Nations will see and become ashamed of all their mightiness. They will put [their] hand upon [their] mouth; their very ears will become deaf.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They will lick up dust like the serpents; like reptiles of [the] earth they will come in agitation out of their bulwarks. To Jehovah our God they will come quivering, and they will be afraid of you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Who is a God like you, one pardoning error and passing over transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? He will certainly not hold onto his anger forever, for he is delighting in loving-kindness.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">He will again show us mercy; he will subject our errors. And you will throw into the depths of [the] sea all their sins.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">You will give [the] trueness [given] to Jacob, [the] loving-kindness [given] to Abraham, which you swore to our forefathers from the days of long ago.</span>
