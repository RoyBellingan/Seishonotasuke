       <span id="vs1">The word of Jehovah that occurred to Joel the son of Pe&middot;thu&acute;el:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Hear this, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> older men, and give ear, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> inhabitants of the land. Has this occurred in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> days, or even in the days of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers?</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Concerning it give an account to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own sons, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons to their sons, and their sons to the following generation.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">What was left by the caterpillar, the locust has eaten; and what was left by the locust, the creeping, unwinged locust has eaten; and what the creeping, unwinged locust has left, the cockroach has eaten.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Wake up, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> drunkards, and weep; and howl, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wine drinkers, on account of sweet wine, for it has been cut off from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mouths.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For there is a nation that has come up into my land, mighty and without number. Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the jawbones of a lion.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It has set my vine as an object of astonishment, and my fig tree as a stump. It has positively stripped it bare and thrown [it] away. The twigs of it have become white.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Wail, as a virgin girded with sackcloth does over the owner of her youth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Grain offering and drink offering have been cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, have mourned.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">[The] field has been despoiled, [the] ground has gone to mourning; for [the] grain has been despoiled, [the] new wine has been dried up, [the] oil has faded away.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Farmers have felt shame; vinedressers have howled, on account of wheat and on account of barley; for the harvest of [the] field has perished.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The vine itself has shown dryness, and even the fig tree has faded away. As for [the] pomegranate tree, also [the] palm tree and [the] apple tree, all the trees of the field, they have dried up; for exultation has gone ashamed away from the sons of mankind.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“Gird yourselves, and beat <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> breasts, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> priests.

       <span id="vs14">Sanctify a time of fasting. Call together a solemn assembly. Gather together [the] older men, all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and cry to Jehovah for aid.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Alas for the day; because the day of Jehovah is near, and like a despoiling from the Almighty One it will come!</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Has not food itself been cut off before our very eyes; from the house of our God, rejoicing and joyfulness?</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Dried figs have shriveled under their shovels. Storehouses have been laid desolate. Barns have been torn down, for [the] grain has dried up.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">O how the domestic animal has sighed! [How] the droves of cattle have wandered in confusion! For there is no pasturage for them. Also, the droves of the sheep have been the ones made to bear guilt.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“To you, O Jehovah, I shall call; for fire itself has devoured the pasture grounds of [the] wilderness, and a very flame has consumed all the trees of the field.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">The beasts of the field also keep longing for you, because the channels of water have dried up, and fire itself has devoured the pasture grounds of the wilderness.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">It is a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick gloom, like light of dawn spread out upon the mountains.</span>
</p>

<p>

       <span id="vs3">Ahead of it a fire has devoured, and behind it a flame consumes. Like the garden of E&acute;den the land is ahead of it; but behind it is a desolate wilderness, and there has also proved to be nothing thereof escaping.</span>

       <span id="vs6">Because of it, peoples will be in severe pains. As for all faces, they will certainly collect a glow [of excitement].</span>

       <span id="vs16">Gather [the] people together. Sanctify a congregation. Collect [the] old men together. Gather children and those sucking the breasts together. Let [the] bridegroom go forth from his interior room, and [the] bride from her nuptial chamber.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Between the porch and the altar let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say, ‘Do feel sorry, O Jehovah, for your people, and do not make your inheritance a reproach, for nations to rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples: “Where is their God?”’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jehovah will be zealous for his land and will show compassion upon his people.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And Jehovah will answer and say to his people, ‘Here I am sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the grain and the new wine and the oil, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will certainly be satisfied with it; and I shall not make <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> anymore a reproach among the nations.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the northerner I shall put far away from upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, and I shall actually disperse him to a waterless land and desolated waste, with his face to the eastern sea and his rear section to the western sea. And the stink from him will certainly ascend, and the stench from him will keep ascending; for He will actually do a great thing in what He does.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Do not be fearful, O ground. Be joyful and rejoice; for Jehovah will actually do a great thing in what He does.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Do not be fearful, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> beasts of the open field, for the pasture grounds of [the] wilderness will certainly grow green. For the tree will actually give its fruitage. The fig tree and the vine must give their vital energy.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God; for he will be bound to give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the autumn rain in right measure, and he will bring down upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people a downpour, autumn rain and spring rain, as at the first.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And the threshing floors must be full of [cleansed] grain, and the press vats must overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And I will make compensation to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for the years that the locust, the creeping, unwinged locust, and the cockroach and the caterpillar have eaten, my great military force that I have sent among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly eat, eating and becoming satisfied, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will be bound to praise the name of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, who has done with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> so wonderfully; and my people will not be ashamed to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will have to know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God and there is no other. And my people will not be ashamed to time indefinite.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“And after that it must occur that I shall pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters will certainly prophesy. As for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> old men, dreams they will dream. As for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> young men, visions they will see.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And even on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days I shall pour out my spirit.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“And I will give portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">The sun itself will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And it must occur that everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will get away safe; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will prove to be the escaped ones, just as Jehovah has said, and in among the survivors, whom Jehovah is calling.”</span>

       <span id="vs14">Crowds, crowds are in the low plain of the decision, for the day of Jehovah is near in the low plain of the decision.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>

       <span id="vs17">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will have to know that I am Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, residing in Zion my holy mountain. And Jerusalem must become a holy place; and as regards strangers, they will no more pass through her.</span>
