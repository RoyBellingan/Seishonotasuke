<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in union with Christ Jesus who are in Phi&middot;lip&acute;pi, along with overseers and ministerial servants:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">May <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">I thank my God always upon every remembrance of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span></span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">in every supplication of mine for all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, as I offer my supplication with joy,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">because of the contribution <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have made to the good news from the first day until this moment.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For I am confident of this very thing, that he who started a good work in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will carry it to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">It is altogether right for me to think this regarding all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, on account of my having <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in my heart, all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> being sharers with me in the undeserved kindness, both in my [prison] bonds and in the defending and legally establishing of the good news.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For God is my witness of how I am yearning for all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in such tender affection as Christ Jesus has.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And this is what I continue praying, that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> love may abound yet more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may make sure of the more important things, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may be flawless and not be stumbling others up to the day of Christ,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and may be filled with righteous fruit, which is through Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Now I desire <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to know, brothers, that my affairs have turned out for the advancement of the good news rather than otherwise,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">so that my bonds have become public knowledge in association with Christ among all the Prae&middot;to&acute;ri&middot;an Guard and all the rest;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">and most of the brothers in [the] Lord, feeling confidence by reason of my [prison] bonds, are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">True, some are preaching the Christ through envy and rivalry, but others also through goodwill.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The latter are publicizing the Christ out of love, for they know I am set here for the defense of the good news;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">but the former do it out of contentiousness, not with a pure motive, for they are supposing to stir up tribulation [for me] in my [prison] bonds.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">What then? [Nothing,] except that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being publicized, and in this I rejoice. In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">for I know this will result in my salvation through <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> supplication and a supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">in harmony with my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be ashamed in any respect, but that in all freeness of speech Christ will, as always before, so now be magnified by means of my body, whether through life or through death.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For in my case to live is Christ, and to die, gain.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Now if it be to live on in the flesh, this is a fruitage of my work—and yet which thing to select I do not make known.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">I am under pressure from these two things; but what I do desire is the releasing and the being with Christ, for this, to be sure, is far better.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">However, for me to remain in the flesh is more necessary on <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> account.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">So, being confident of this, I know I shall remain and shall abide with all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> advancement and the joy that belongs to [<span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span>] faith,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">so that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> exultation may overflow in Christ Jesus by reason of me through my presence again with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> or be absent, I may hear about the things which concern <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul striving side by side for the faith of the good news,</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">and in no respect being frightened by <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> opponents. This very thing is a proof of destruction for them, but of salvation for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>; and this [indication] is from God,</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">because to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> the privilege was given in behalf of Christ, not only to put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faith in him, but also to suffer in his behalf.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have the same struggle as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> saw in my case and as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> now hear about in my case.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any sharing of spirit, if any tender affections and compassions,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">make my joy full in that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are of the same mind and have the same love, being joined together in soul, holding the one thought in mind,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">doing nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with lowliness of mind considering that the others are superior to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Keep this mental attitude in <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> that was also in Christ Jesus,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">who, although he was existing in God’s form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">More than that, when he found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every [other] name,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently, my beloved ones, in the way that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have always obeyed, not during my presence only, but now much more readily during my absence, keep working out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own salvation with fear and trembling;</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">for God is the one that, for the sake of [his] good pleasure, is acting within <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in order for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> both to will and to act.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Keep doing all things free from murmurings and arguments,</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may come to be blameless and innocent, children of God without a blemish in among a crooked and twisted generation, among whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are shining as illuminators in the world,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">keeping a tight grip on the word of life, that I may have cause for exultation in Christ’s day, that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Notwithstanding, even if I am being poured out like a drink offering upon the sacrifice and public service to which faith has led <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, I am glad and I rejoice with all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Now in the same way <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves also be glad and rejoice with me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For my part I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> shortly, that I may be a cheerful soul when I get to know about the things pertaining to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">For I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child with a father he slaved with me in furtherance of the good news.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">This, therefore, is the man I am hoping to send just as soon as I have seen how things stand concerning me.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Indeed, I am confident in [the] Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">However, I consider it necessary to send to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> E&middot;paph&middot;ro&middot;di&acute;tus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> envoy and private servant for my need,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">since he is longing to see all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and is depressed because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heard he had fallen sick.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Yes, indeed, he fell sick nearly to the point of death; but God had mercy on him, in fact, not only on him, but also on me, that I should not get grief upon grief.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore with the greater haste I am sending him, that on seeing him <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may rejoice again and I may be the more free from grief.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Therefore give him the customary welcome in [the] Lord with all joy; and keep holding men of that sort dear,</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">because on account of the Lord’s work he came quite near to death, exposing his soul to danger, that he might fully make up for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> not being here to render private service to me.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Finally, my brothers, continue rejoicing in [the] Lord. To be writing the same things to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> is not troublesome for me, but it is of safety to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Look out for the dogs, look out for the workers of injury, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For we are those with the real circumcision, who are rendering sacred service by God’s spirit and have our boasting in Christ Jesus and do not have our confidence in the flesh,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">though I, if anyone, do have grounds for confidence also in the flesh.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">If any other man thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I the more so:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">circumcised the eighth day, out of the family stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew [born] from Hebrews; as respects law, a Pharisee;</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">as respects zeal, persecuting the congregation; as respects righteousness that is by means of law, one who proved himself blameless.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Yet what things were gains to me, these I have considered loss on account of the Christ.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Why, for that matter, I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse, that I may gain Christ</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and be found in union with him, having, not my own righteousness, which results from law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that issues from God on the basis of faith,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">so as to know him and the power of his resurrection and a sharing in his sufferings, submitting myself to a death like his,</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">[to see] if I may by any means attain to the earlier resurrection from the dead.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Not that I have already received it or am already made perfect, but I am pursuing to see if I may also lay hold on that for which I have also been laid hold on by Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Brothers, I do not yet consider myself as having laid hold on [it]; but there is one thing about it: Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above [attitude] to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, and keep <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eye on those who are walking in a way that accords with the example <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have in us.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For there are many, I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping, who are walking as the enemies of the torture stake of the Christ,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">and their finish is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory consists in their shame, and they have their minds upon things on the earth.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">As for us, our citizenship exists in the heavens, from which place also we are eagerly waiting for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">who will refashion our humiliated body to be conformed to his glorious body according to the operation of the power that he has, even to subject all things to himself.</span>
