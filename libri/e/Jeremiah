<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hil&middot;ki&acute;ah, one of the priests that were in An&acute;a&middot;thoth in the land of Benjamin;</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">to whom the word of Jehovah occurred in the days of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah the son of A&acute;mon, the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reigning.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And it kept on occurring in the days of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, the king of Judah, until the completion of the eleventh year of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, the king of Judah, until Jerusalem went into exile in the fifth month.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the word of Jehovah began to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Before I was forming you in the belly I knew you, and before you proceeded to come forth from the womb I sanctified you. Prophet to the nations I made you.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But I said: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here I actually do not know how to speak, for I am but a boy.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Do not say, ‘I am but a boy.’ But to all those to whom I shall send you, you should go; and everything that I shall command you, you should speak.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Do not be afraid because of their faces, for ‘I am with you to deliver you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">At that Jehovah thrust his hand out and caused it to touch my mouth. Then Jehovah said to me: “Here I have put my words in your mouth.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">See, I have commissioned you this day to be over the nations and over the kingdoms, in order to uproot and to pull down and to destroy and to tear down, to build and to plant.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-2">So I said: “An offshoot of an almond tree is what I am seeing.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “You have seen well, for I am keeping awake concerning my word in order to carry it out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to me the second time, saying: “What are you seeing?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs13-2">So I said: “A widemouthed cooking pot blown upon is what I am seeing, and its mouth is away from the north.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">At this Jehovah said to me: “Out of the north the calamity will be loosened against all the inhabitants of the land.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For ‘here I am calling for all the families of the kingdoms of the north,’ is the utterance of Jehovah; ‘and they will certainly come and place each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all her walls round about and against all the cities of Judah.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I will speak with them my judgments over all their badness, in that they have left me and they keep making sacrificial smoke to other gods and bowing down to the works of their own hands.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And as for you, you should gird up your hips, and you must rise up and speak to them everything that I myself command you. Do not be struck with any terror because of them, in order that I may not strike you with terror before them.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But as for me, here I have made you today a fortified city and an iron pillar and copper walls against all the land, toward the kings of Judah, toward her princes, toward her priests and toward the people of the land.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And they will be certain to fight against you, but they will not prevail against you, for ‘I am with you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to deliver you.’”</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Go, and you must call out in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “I well remember, on your part, the loving-kindness of your youth, the love during your being engaged to marry, your walking after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown with seed.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Israel was something holy to Jehovah, the first yield to Him.”’ ‘Any persons devouring him would make themselves guilty. Calamity itself would come upon them,’ was the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Hear the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> families of the house of Israel.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">This is what Jehovah has said: “What have <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers found in me that was unjust, so that they have become far off from me, and they kept walking after the vain idol and becoming vain themselves?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And they have not said, ‘Where is Jehovah, the One bringing us up out of the land of Egypt, the One walking us through the wilderness, through a land of desert plain and pit, through a land of no water and of deep shadow, through a land through which no man passed and in which no earthling man dwelt?’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“And I gradually brought <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to a land of the orchard, to eat its fruitage and its good things. But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> came in and defiled my land; and my own inheritance <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> made something detestable.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The priests themselves did not say, ‘Where is Jehovah?’ And the very ones handling the law did not know me; and the shepherds themselves transgressed against me, and even the prophets prophesied by Ba&acute;al, and after those who could bring no benefit they walked.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“‘Therefore I shall contend further with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and with the sons of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons I shall contend.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“‘But pass over to the coastlands of the Kit&acute;tim and see. Yes, send even to Ke&acute;dar and give <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> special consideration, and see whether anything like this has happened.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Has a nation exchanged gods, even for those that are no gods? But my own people have exchanged my glory for what can bring no benefit.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Stare in amazement, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> heavens, at this; and bristle up in very great horror,’ is the utterance of Jehovah,</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">‘because there are two bad things that my people have done: They have left even me, the source of living water, in order to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot contain the water.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘Is Israel a servant, or a slave born in the household? Why is it that he has come to be for plunder?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Against him maned young lions roar; they have given out their voice. And they went making his land an object of astonishment. His own cities have been set afire, so that there is no inhabitant.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Even the sons of Noph and Tah&acute;pan&middot;es themselves kept feeding on you at the crown of the head.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Is not this what you proceeded to do to yourself by your leaving Jehovah your God during the time of [his] walking you in the way?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And now what concern should you have for the way of Egypt in order to drink the waters of Shi&acute;hor? And what concern should you have for the way of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a in order to drink the waters of the River?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Your badness should correct you, and your own acts of unfaithfulness should reprove you. Know, then, and see that your leaving Jehovah your God is something bad and bitter, and no dread of me [has resulted] to you,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“‘For long ago I broke your yoke to pieces; I tore your bands apart. But you said: “I am not going to serve,” for upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree you were lying sprawled out, prostituting yourself.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And as for me, I had planted you as a choice red vine, all of it a true seed. So how have you been changed toward me into the degenerate [shoots] of a foreign vine?’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“‘But though you should do the washing with alkali and take to yourself large quantities of lye, your error would certainly be a stain before me,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself. After the Ba&acute;als I have not walked’? See your way in the valley. Take note of what you have done. A swift young she-camel aimlessly running to and fro in her ways;</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">a zebra accustomed to the wilderness, at the craving of her soul, snuffing up the wind; at her time for copulation, who can turn her back? All those who are looking for her will not go tiring themselves out. In her month they will find her.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Hold your foot back from [becoming] barefoot, and your throat from thirst. But you proceeded to say, ‘It is hopeless! No, but I have fallen in love with strangers, and after them I am going to walk.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“As with the shame of a thief when he is found out, so those of the house of Israel have felt shame, they, their kings, their princes and their priests and their prophets.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">They are saying to a tree, ‘You are my father,’ and to a stone, ‘You yourself brought me to birth.’ But to me they have turned the back of the neck and not the face. And in the time of their calamity they will say, ‘Do rise up and save us!’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“But where are your gods that you have made for yourself? Let them rise up if they can save you in the time of your calamity. For as the number of your cities your gods have become, O Judah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“‘Why do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people keep contending against me? Why have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> transgressed, all of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, against me?’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">To no effect I have struck <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons. No discipline did they take. Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> sword has devoured <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> prophets, like a lion that is causing ruin.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">O generation, see for yourselves the word of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs31-2">“Have I become a mere wilderness to Israel or a land of intense darkness? Why is it that these, my people, have said, ‘We have roamed. We shall come to you no more’?</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">Can a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her breastbands? And yet my own people—they have forgotten me days without number.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“Why do you, O woman, improve your way in order to look for love? Therefore it has also been in bad things that you have taught your ways.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Also, in your skirts there have been found the blood marks of the souls of the innocent poor ones. Not in the act of breaking in have I found them, but [they are] upon all these.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“But you say, ‘I have remained innocent. Surely his anger has turned back from me.’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs35-2">“Here I am entering into controversy with you on account of your saying, ‘I have not sinned.’</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Why do you treat as very insignificant the changing of your way? Of Egypt, too, you will become ashamed, just as you became ashamed of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">For this cause also you will go forth with your hands upon your head, because Jehovah has rejected the objects of your confidence, and you will have no success with them.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">There is a saying: “If a man should send away his wife and she should actually go away from him and become another man’s, should he return to her anymore?”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-2">Has that land not positively been polluted?</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs1-3">“And you yourself have committed prostitution with many companions; and should there be a returning to me?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Raise your eyes to the beaten paths and see. Where is it that you have not been raped? Alongside the ways you have sat for them, like an Arabian in the wilderness; and you keep polluting the land with your acts of prostitution and with your badness.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So copious showers are withheld, and not even a spring rain has occurred. And the forehead of a wife committing prostitution is what has become yours. You have refused to feel humiliated.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Have you from now on called out to me, ‘My Father, you are the confidential friend of my youth!</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Should one stay resentful to time indefinite, or keep watching [something] forever?’ Look! You have spoken, and you went on to do bad things and prevail.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Jehovah proceeded to say to me in the days of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah the king: “‘Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She is going upon every high mountain and underneath every luxuriant tree, that she may commit prostitution there.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And after her doing all these things I kept saying that she should return even to me, but she did not return; and Judah kept looking at her own treacherous sister.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">When I got to see that, for the very reason that unfaithful Israel had committed adultery, I sent her away and proceeded to give the certificate of her full divorce to her, yet treacherously dealing Judah her sister did not become afraid, but she herself also began to go and commit prostitution.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And her prostitution occurred because of [her] frivolous view, and she kept polluting the land and committing adultery with stones and with trees;</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and even for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, only falsely,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Unfaithful Israel has proved her own soul to be more righteous than treacherously dealing Judah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Go, and you must proclaim these words to the north and say:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs12-2">“‘“Do return, O renegade Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’ ‘“I shall not have my face drop [angrily] upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, for I am loyal,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’ ‘“I shall not stay resentful to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Only take note of your error, for it is against Jehovah your God that you have transgressed. And you continued scattering your ways to the strangers under every luxuriant tree, but to my voice <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people did not listen,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“Return, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> renegade sons,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “For I myself have become the husbandly owner of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people; and I will take <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, one out of a city and two out of a family, and I will bring <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to Zion.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> shepherds in agreement with my heart, and they will certainly feed <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with knowledge and insight.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And it must occur that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will become many and certainly bear fruit in the land in those days,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “No more will they say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Jehovah!’ nor will it come up into the heart, nor will they remember it or miss it, and no more will it be made.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">In that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and to her all the nations must be brought together to the name of Jehovah at Jerusalem, and they will no more walk after the stubbornness of their bad heart.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“In those days they will walk, the house of Judah alongside the house of Israel, and together they will come out of the land of the north into the land that I gave as a hereditary possession to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I myself have said, ‘O how I proceeded to place you among the sons and to give you the desirable land, the hereditary possession of the ornament of the armies of the nations!’ And I further said, ‘“My Father!” <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will call out to me, and from following me <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will not turn back.’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">‘Truly [as] a wife has treacherously gone from her companion, so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, O house of Israel, have dealt treacherously with me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">On the beaten paths there has been heard a sound, the weeping, the entreaties of the sons of Israel. For they have twisted their way; they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Return, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> renegade sons. I shall heal <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> renegade condition.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs22-2">“Here we are! We have come to you, for you, O Jehovah, are our God.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Truly the hills as well as the turmoil on the mountains belong to falsehood. Truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But the shameful thing itself has eaten up the toil of our forefathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">We lie down in our shame, and our humiliation keeps covering us; for it is toward Jehovah our God that we have sinned, we and our fathers from our youth on and down to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">“If you would return, O Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “you may return even to me. And if you will take away your disgusting things on my account, then you will not go as a fugitive.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And [if] you will certainly swear, ‘As Jehovah is alive in truth, in justice and in righteousness!’ then in him the nations will actually bless themselves, and in him they will boast about themselves.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For this is what Jehovah has said to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Plow for yourselves arable land, and do not keep sowing among thorns.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Get yourselves circumcised to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hearts, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; that my rage may not go forth just like a fire, and it certainly burn with no one to do the extinguishing, on account of the badness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Tell [it] in Judah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, and publish [it] even in Jerusalem, and say [it] out, and blow a horn throughout the land. Call out loudly and say: “Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Raise a signal toward Zion. Make provision for shelter. Do not stand still.” For there is a calamity that I am bringing in from the north, even a great crash.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He has gone up as a lion out of his thicket, and the one who is bringing the nations to ruin has pulled away; he has gone forth from his place in order to render your land as an object of astonishment. Your own cities will fall in ruins so that there will be no inhabitant.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">On this account gird on sackcloth, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people. Beat <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> breasts and howl, because the burning anger of Jehovah has not turned back from us.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“And it must occur in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “that the heart of the king will perish, also the heart of the princes; and the priests will certainly be driven to astonishment, and the prophets themselves will be amazed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And I proceeded to say: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Truly you have absolutely deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘Peace itself will become <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>,’ and the sword has reached clear to the soul.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: “There is a searing wind of the beaten paths through the wilderness [on] the way to the daughter of my people; it is not for winnowing, nor for cleansing.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The full wind itself comes even from these to me. Now I myself also shall speak forth the judgments with them.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Look! Like rain clouds he will come up, and his chariots are like a storm wind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, because we have been despoiled!</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Wash your heart clean of sheer badness, O Jerusalem, in order that you may be saved. How long will your erroneous thoughts lodge within you?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For a voice is telling from Dan and is publishing something hurtful from the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Make mention [of it], <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, yes, to the nations. Publish [it] against Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs16-2">“Watchers are coming from a land far away, and they will let out their voice against the very cities of Judah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Like guards of the open field they have become against her on all sides, because she has rebelled even against me,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Your way and your dealings—there will be a rendering of these to you. This is the calamity upon you, for it is bitter; because it has reached clear to your heart.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">O my intestines, my intestines! I am in severe pains in the walls of my heart. My heart is boisterous within me. I cannot keep silent, for the sound of the horn is what my soul has heard, the alarm signal of war.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Crash upon crash is what has been called out, for the whole land has been despoiled. Suddenly my tents have been despoiled, in a moment my tent cloths.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">How long shall I keep seeing the signal, keep hearing the sound of the horn?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For my people is foolish. Of me they have not taken note. They are unwise sons; and they are not those having understanding. Wise they are for doing bad, but for doing good they actually have no knowledge.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">I saw the land, and, look! [it was] empty and waste; and into the heavens, and their light was no more.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">I saw the mountains, and, look! they were rocking, and the hills themselves were all given a shaking.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">I saw, and, look! there was not an earthling man, and the flying creatures of the heavens had all fled.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">I saw, and, look! the orchard itself was a wilderness, and the very cities of it had all been torn down. It was because of Jehovah, because of his burning anger.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">For this is what Jehovah has said: “A desolate waste is what the whole land will become, and shall I not carry out a sheer extermination?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">On this account the land will mourn, and the heavens above will certainly become dark. It is because I have spoken, I have considered, and I have not felt regret, nor shall I turn back from it.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Because of the sound of the horsemen and bow shooters the entire city is running away. They have entered into the thickets, and into the rocks they have gone up. Every city is left, and there is no man dwelling in them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Now that you are despoiled, what will you do, since you used to clothe yourself with scarlet, since you used to deck yourself with ornaments of gold, since you used to enlarge your eyes with black paint? It is in vain that you used to make yourself pretty. Those lusting after [you] have rejected you; they keep seeking for your very soul.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">For a voice like that of a sick woman I have heard, the distress like that of a woman giving birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion who keeps gasping for breath. She keeps spreading out her palms: “Woe, now, to me, for my soul is tired of the killers!”</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="31">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Go roving about in the streets of Jerusalem and see, now, and know, and seek for yourselves in her public squares whether <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> can find a man, whether there exists anyone doing justice, anyone seeking faithfulness, and I shall forgive her.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Even if they should say: “As Jehovah is alive!” they would thereby be swearing to sheer falsehood.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">O Jehovah, are not those eyes of yours toward faithfulness? You have struck them, but they did not become ill. You exterminated them. They refused to take discipline. They made their faces harder than a crag. They refused to turn back.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Even I myself had said: “Surely they are of low class. They acted foolishly, for they have ignored the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">I will go my way to the great ones and speak with them; for they themselves must have taken note of the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God. Surely they themselves must have all together broken the yoke; they must have torn apart the bands.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">That is why a lion out of the forest has struck them, a wolf itself of the desert plains keeps despoiling them, a leopard is keeping awake at their cities. Everyone going forth from them gets torn to pieces. For their transgressions have become many; their acts of unfaithfulness have become numerous.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">How can I forgive you for this very thing? Your own sons have left me, and they keep swearing by what is no God. And I kept satisfying them, but they continued committing adultery, and to the house of a prostitute woman they go in troops.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Horses seized with sexual heat, having [strong] testicles, they have become. They neigh each one to the wife of his companion.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Should I not take an accounting because of these very things?” is the utterance of Jehovah. “Or upon a nation that is like this should not my soul avenge itself?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“Come up against her [vine] rows and cause ruin, but do not <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men make an actual extermination. Take away her luxuriating shoots, for they do not belong to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have positively dealt treacherously with me,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“They have denied Jehovah, and they keep saying, ‘He is not. And upon us no calamity will come, and no sword or famine shall we see.’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And the prophets themselves become a wind, and the word is not in them. That is how it will be done to them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, has said: “For the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are saying this thing, here I am making my words in your mouth a fire, and this people will be pieces of wood, and it will certainly devour them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Here I am bringing in upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men a nation from far away, O house of Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “It is an enduring nation. It is a nation of long ago, a nation whose language you do not know, and you cannot hear [understandingly] what they speak.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Their quiver is like an open burial place; all of them are mighty men.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They will also certainly eat up your harvest and your bread. The men will eat up your sons and your daughters. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will eat up your vine and your fig tree. They will shatter with the sword your fortified cities in which you are trusting.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“And even in those days,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “I shall not carry out an extermination of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And it must occur that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say, ‘Due to what fact has Jehovah our God done to us all these things?’ And you must say to them, ‘Just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have left me and have gone serving a foreign god in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> land, so <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will serve strangers in a land that is not <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">T<span class="smallcaps">ELL</span> this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Hear, now, this, O unwise people that is without heart: They have eyes, but they cannot see; they have ears, but they cannot hear.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">‘Do <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not fear even me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘or are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in no severe pains even because of me, who have set the sand as the boundary for the sea, an indefinitely lasting regulation that it cannot pass over? Although its waves toss themselves, still they cannot prevail; and [although] they do become boisterous, still they cannot pass over it.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But this very people has come to have a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and keep walking in their course.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But they have not said in their heart: “Let us, now, fear Jehovah our God, the One who is giving the downpour and the autumn rain and the spring rain in its season, the One who guards even the prescribed weeks of the harvest for us.”</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Y<span class="smallcaps">OUR</span> own errors have turned these things away, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own sins have held back what is good from <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“‘For among my people there have been found wicked men. They keep peering, as when birdcatchers crouch down. They have set a ruinous [trap]. It is men that they catch.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">As a cage is full of flying creatures, so their houses are full of deception. That is why they have become great and they gain riches.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">They have grown fat; they have become shiny. They have also overflowed with bad things. No legal case have they pleaded, even the legal case of the fatherless boy, that they may gain success; and the judgment of the poor ones they have not taken up.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Should I not hold an accounting because of these very things,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “or on a nation that is like this should not my soul avenge itself?</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">An astonishing situation, even a horrible thing, has been brought to be in the land:</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">The prophets themselves actually prophesy in falsehood; and as for the priests, they go subduing according to their powers. And my own people have loved [it] that way; and what will <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men do in the finale of it?”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Take shelter, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sons of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem; and in Te&middot;ko&acute;a blow the horn. And over Beth-hac&middot;che&acute;rem raise a fire signal; because calamity itself has looked down out of the north, even a great crash.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">The daughter of Zion has resembled indeed a comely and daintily bred woman.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">To her the shepherds and their droves proceeded to come. Against her they pitched [their] tents all around. They grazed off each one his own part.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Against her they have sanctified war: “Rise up, and let us go up at midday!”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs4-2">“Woe to us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of evening keep extending themselves!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“Rise up, and let us go up during the night and bring to ruin her dwelling towers.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Cut down wood and throw up against Jerusalem a siege rampart. She is the city with which an accounting must be held. She is nothing but oppression in the midst of her.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">As a cistern keeps its waters cool, so she has kept her badness cool. Violence and despoiling are heard in her; sickness and plague are before my face constantly.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Be corrected, O Jerusalem, that my soul may not turn away disgusted from you; that I may not set you as a desolate waste, a land not inhabited.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “They will without fail glean the remnant of Israel just like a vine. Put your hand back like one that is gathering grapes upon the vine tendrils.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Look! Their ear is uncircumcised, so that they are unable to pay attention. Look! The very word of Jehovah has become to them a reproach, in which [word] they can take no delight.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And with the rage of Jehovah I have become full. I have become weary with holding in.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-2">“Pour [it] out upon the child in the street and upon the intimate group of young men at the same time; for they will also be caught, a man along with his wife, an old man along with one that is full of days.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And their houses will certainly be turned over to others for possession, the fields and the wives at the same time. For I shall stretch my hand out against the inhabitants of the land,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“For from the least one of them even to the greatest one of them, every one is making for himself unjust gain; and from the prophet even to the priest, each one is acting falsely.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And they try to heal the breakdown of my people lightly, saying, ‘There is peace! There is peace!’ when there is no peace.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Did they feel shame because it was something detestable that they had done? For one thing, they positively do not feel any shame; for another thing, they have not come to know even how to feel humiliated. Therefore they will fall among those who are falling; in the time that I must hold an accounting with them they will stumble,” Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">This is what Jehovah has said: “Stand still in the ways, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and see, and ask for the roadways of long ago, where, now, the good way is; and walk in it, and find ease for <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls.” But they kept saying: “We are not going to walk.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And I raised up over <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people watchmen, ‘Pay attention to the sound of the horn!’” But they kept saying: “We are not going to pay attention.”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Therefore hear, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> nations! And know, O you assembly, what will be among them.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Listen, O earth! Here I am bringing in calamity upon this people as the fruitage of their thoughts, for they paid no attention to my very own words; and my law—they also kept rejecting it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“What does this matter to me that you bring in even frankincense from She&acute;ba and the good cane from the land far away? The whole burnt offerings of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people serve for no pleasure, and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> very sacrifices have not been gratifying to me.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am setting for this people stumbling blocks, and they will certainly stumble over them, fathers and sons together; the neighbor and his companion—they will perish.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">This is what Jehovah has said: “Look! A people is coming from the land of the north, and there is a great nation that will be awakened from the remotest parts of the earth.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">The bow and the javelin they will grab hold of. It is a cruel one, and they will have no pity. Their very voice will resound just like the sea, and upon horses they will ride. It is drawn up in battle order like a man of war against you, O daughter of Zion.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">We have heard the report about it. Our hands have dropped. Distress itself has seized hold of us, labor pains like those of a woman giving birth.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Do not go out into the field, and do not walk even in the way; for there is the sword belonging to the enemy, there is fright all around.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth and wallow in the ashes. Make your mourning that for an only [son], the wailing of bitterness; because suddenly the despoiler will come upon us.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“I have made you a metal tester among my people, one making a thorough search; and you will take note and you must examine their way.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">All of them are the most stubborn men, walking about as slanderers—copper and iron. They are all of them ruinous.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">The bellows have been scorched. Out from their fire there is lead. One has kept refining intensely simply for nothing, and those who are bad have not been separated.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them, for Jehovah has rejected them.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and you must proclaim there this word, and you must say, ‘Hear the word of Jehovah, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> of Judah, who are entering into these gates to bow down to Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “Make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ways and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings good, and I will keep <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people residing in this place.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Do not put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trust in fallacious words, saying, ‘The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah they are!’</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will positively make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ways and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings good, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will positively carry out justice between a man and his companion,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">if no alien resident, no fatherless boy and no widow <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will oppress, and innocent blood <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not shed in this place, and after other gods <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not walk for calamity to yourselves,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">I, in turn, shall certainly keep <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> residing in this place, in the land that I gave to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, from time indefinite even to time indefinite.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Here <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are putting <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trust in fallacious words—it will certainly be of no benefit at all.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Can there be stealing, murdering and committing adultery and swearing falsely and making sacrificial smoke to Ba&acute;al and walking after other gods whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had not known,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">and must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> come and stand before me in this house upon which my name has been called, and must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> say, ‘We shall certainly be delivered,’ in the face of doing all these detestable things?</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Has this house upon which my name has been called become a mere cave of robbers in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes? Here I myself also have seen [it],” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“‘However, <span class="smallcaps">GO</span>, now, to my place that was in Shi&acute;loh, where I caused my name to reside at first, and see what I did to it because of the badness of my people Israel.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And now for the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept doing all these works,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I kept speaking to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, getting up early and speaking, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not listen, and I kept calling <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not answer,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">I will do also to the house upon which my name has been called, in which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are trusting, and to the place that I gave to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, just as I did to Shi&acute;loh.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I will throw <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out from before my face, just as I threw out all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> brothers, the whole offspring of E&acute;phra&middot;im.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“And as for you, do not pray in behalf of this people, neither raise in their behalf an entreating cry or a prayer nor beseech me, for I shall not be listening to you.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Are you not seeing what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">The sons are picking up sticks of wood, and the fathers are lighting the fire, and the wives are kneading flour dough in order to make sacrificial cakes to the ‘queen of the heavens’; and there is a pouring out of drink offerings to other gods for the purpose of offending me.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">‘Is it I whom they are offending?’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘Is it not they themselves, for the purpose of shame to their faces?’</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Look! My anger and my rage are being poured forth upon this place, upon mankind and upon domestic animal, and upon the tree of the field and upon the fruitage of the ground; and it must burn, and it will not be extinguished.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Add those whole burnt offerings of <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span> to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sacrifices and eat flesh.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">For I did not speak with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, nor did I command them in the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt concerning the matters of whole burnt offering and sacrifice.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">But this word I did express in command upon them, saying: “Obey my voice, and I will become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves will become my people; and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> must walk in all the way that I shall command <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, in order that it may go well with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”’</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">But they did not listen, neither did they incline their ear, but they went walking in the counsels in the stubbornness of their bad heart, so that they became backward in direction and not forward,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">from the day that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers came forth out of the land of Egypt until this day; and I kept sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all my servants the prophets, daily getting up early and sending [them].</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">But they did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ear, but they kept hardening their neck. They acted worse than their forefathers!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“And you must speak to them all these words, but they will not listen to you; and you must call to them, but they will not answer you.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And you must say to them, ‘This is the nation whose people have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah its God, and have not taken discipline. Faithfulness has perished, and it has been cut off from their mouth.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Shear off your uncut hair and throw [it] away, and upon the bare hills raise a dirge, for Jehovah has rejected and will desert the generation with which he is furious.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">‘For the sons of Judah have done what is bad in my eyes,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘They have set their disgusting things in the house upon which my name has been called, in order to defile it.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And they have built the high places of To&acute;pheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“‘Therefore, look! days are coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘when it will no more be said [to be] To&acute;pheth and the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom, but the valley of the killing; and they will have to bury in To&acute;pheth without there being enough place.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And the dead bodies of this people must become food for the flying creatures of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth, with nobody to make [them] tremble.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of exultation and the voice of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become nothing but a devastated place.’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">“At that time,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “people will also bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of its princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And they will actually spread them out to the sun and to the moon and to all the army of the heavens that they have loved and that they have served and that they have walked after and that they have sought and that they have bowed down to. They will not be gathered, nor will they be buried. As manure upon the face of the ground they will become.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“And death will certainly be chosen rather than life on the part of all the remnant of those remaining out of this bad family in all the places of the remaining ones, where I will have dispersed them,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“And you must say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Will they fall and not get up again? If one would turn back, will the other not also turn back?</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Why is it that this people, Jerusalem, is unfaithful with an enduring unfaithfulness? They have taken hold of trickiness; they have refused to turn back.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">I have paid attention, and I kept listening. It was not right the way they kept speaking. There was not a man repenting over his badness, saying, ‘What have I done?’ Each one is going back into the popular course, like a horse that is dashing into the battle.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Even the stork in the heavens—it well knows its appointed times; and the turtledove and the swift and the bulbul—they observe well the time of each one’s coming in. But as for my people, they have not come to know the judgment of Jehovah.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“‘How can <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men say: “We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us”? Surely, now, the false stylus of the secretaries has worked in sheer falsehood.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The wise ones have become ashamed. They have become terrified and will be caught. Look! They have rejected the very word of Jehovah, and what wisdom do they have?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Therefore I shall give their wives to other men, their fields to those taking possession; for, from the least one even to the greatest one, each one is making unjust gain; from the prophet even to the priest, each one is acting falsely.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And they try to heal the breakdown of the daughter of my people lightly, saying: “There is peace! There is peace!” when there is no peace.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Did they feel shame because they had done even what was detestable? For one thing, they positively could not feel ashamed; for another thing, they did not know even how to feel humiliated.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs12-2">“‘Therefore they will fall among those who are falling. In the time of their being given attention, they will stumble,’ Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs13">“‘When doing the gathering, I shall bring them to their finish,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘There will be no grapes on the vine, and there will be no figs on the fig tree, and the foliage itself will certainly wither. And things that I give to them will pass by them.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“Why are we sitting still? Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities and be silent there. For Jehovah our God has himself put us to silence, and he gives us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">There was a hoping for peace, but no good [came]; for a time of healing, but, look! terror!</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">From Dan has been heard the snorting of his horses. Due to the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land has begun to rock. And they come in and eat up the land and what fills it, the city and its inhabitants.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“For here I am sending in among <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> serpents, poisonous snakes, for which there is no charming, and they will certainly bite <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">A grief that is beyond curing has come up into me. My heart is ill.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Here there is the sound of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from a land far away: “Is Jehovah not in Zion? Or is her king not in her?”</span>

       <span id="vs22">Is there no balsam in Gil&acute;e&middot;ad? Or is there no healer there? Why is it, then, that the recuperation of the daughter of my people has not come up?</span>

<form class="formtext">

<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="26">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">O that my head were waters, and that my eyes were a source of tears! Then I could weep day and night for the slain ones of the daughter of my people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">O that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of travelers! Then I would leave my people and go away from them, for all of them are adulterers, a solemn assembly of treacherous dealers;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">and they bend their tongue as their bow in falsehood; but not for faithfulness have they proved mighty in the land.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“For from badness to badness they went forth, and they ignored even me,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Guard yourselves each one against his own companion, and put <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> trust in no brother at all. For even every brother would positively supplant, and every companion himself would walk around as a mere slanderer,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">and they keep trifling each one with his companion; and they speak no truth at all. They have taught their tongue to speak falsehood. They have tired themselves out merely in doing wrong.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“Your sitting is in the midst of deception. Through deception they have refused to know me,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Here I am smelting them, and I have to examine them, because how otherwise shall I act on account of the daughter of my people?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Their tongue is a slaughtering arrow. Deception is what it has spoken. With his mouth, peace is what [a person] keeps speaking with his own companion; but within himself he sets his ambush.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“Because of these things should I not hold an accounting with them?” is the utterance of Jehovah. “Or upon a nation that is like this should not my soul avenge itself?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Over the mountains I shall raise a weeping and lamentation, and over the pasture grounds of the wilderness a dirge; for they will have been burned so that there is no man passing through and people actually will not hear the sound of livestock. Both the flying creature of the heavens and the beast will have fled; they will have gone.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And I will make Jerusalem piles of stones, the lair of jackals; and the cities of Judah I shall make a desolate waste, without an inhabitant.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Who is the man that is wise, that he may understand this, even the one to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may tell it? On what account should the land actually perish, be actually burned like the wilderness without anyone passing through?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Jehovah proceeded to say: “On account of their leaving my law that I gave [to be] before them, and [because] they have not obeyed my voice and have not walked in it,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">but they kept on walking after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Ba&acute;al images, about which their fathers had taught them;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am making them, that is, this people, eat wormwood, and I will make them drink poisoned water;</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">and I will scatter them among the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send after them the sword until I shall have exterminated them.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Behave with understanding, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and call the dirge-chanting women, that they may come; and send even to the skilled women, that they may come,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">and that they may hurry and raise up over us a lamentation. And may our eyes run down with tears and our own beaming eyes trickle with waters.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For the voice of lamentation is what has been heard from Zion: “How we have been despoiled! How much we have felt shame! For we have left the land; for they have thrown away our residences.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But hear, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> women, the word of Jehovah, and may <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ear take the word of his mouth. Then teach <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> daughters a lamentation, and each woman her companion a dirge.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For death has come up through our windows; it has come into our dwelling towers, in order to cut off the child from the street, the young men from the public squares.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“Speak, ‘This is what the utterance of Jehovah is: “The dead bodies of mankind must also fall like manure upon the face of the field and like a row of newly cut grain after the reaper, with no one to do the gathering up.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">This is what Jehovah has said: “Let not the wise man brag about himself because of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man brag about himself because of his mightiness. Let not the rich man brag about himself because of his riches.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“But let the one bragging about himself brag about himself because of this very thing, the having of insight and the having of knowledge of me, that I am Jehovah, the One exercising loving-kindness, justice and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I do take delight,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Look! Days are coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will hold an accounting with everyone circumcised [but still] in uncircumcision,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">upon Egypt and upon Judah and upon E&acute;dom and upon the sons of Am&acute;mon and upon Mo&acute;ab and upon all those with hair clipped at the temples who are dwelling in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”</span>

<form class="formtext">
<input type="hidden" name="chapterCount" value="52">
<input type="hidden" name="verseCount" value="25">
<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">Hear the word that Jehovah has spoken against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, O house of Israel.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This is what Jehovah has said: “Do not learn the way of the nations at all, and do not be struck with terror even at the signs of the heavens, because the nations are struck with terror at them.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For the customs of the peoples are just an exhalation, because it is a mere tree out of the forest that one has cut down, the work of the hands of the craftsman with the billhook.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">With silver and with gold one makes it pretty. With nails and with hammers they fasten them down, that none may reel.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">They are like a scarecrow of a cucumber field, and cannot speak. Without fail they are carried, for they cannot take any steps. Do not be afraid because of them, for they can do nothing calamitous and, what is more, the doing of any good is not with them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In no way is there anyone like you, O Jehovah. You are great, and your name is great in mightiness.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Who should not fear you, O King of the nations, for to you it is fitting; because among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their kingships there is in no way anyone like you.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And at one and the same time they prove to be unreasoning and stupid. A tree is a mere exhortation of vanities.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Silver beaten into plates is what is brought in even from Tar&acute;shish, and gold from U&acute;phaz, the workmanship of a craftsman and of the hands of a metalworker; their clothing is blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple. They are all the workmanship of skilled people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But Jehovah is in truth God. He is the living God and the King to time indefinite. Because of his indignation the earth will rock, and no nations will hold up under his denunciation.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men will say to them: “The gods that did not make the very heavens and the earth are the ones who will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">He is the Maker of the earth by his power, the One firmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom, and the One who by his understanding stretched out the heavens.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At [his] voice there is a giving by him of a turmoil of waters in the heavens, and he causes vapors to ascend from the extremity of the earth. He has made even sluices for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Every man has behaved so unreasoningly as not to know. Every metalworker will certainly feel shame because of the carved image; for his molten image is a falsehood, and there is no spirit in them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">They are vanity, a work of mockery. In the time of their being given attention they will perish.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The Share of Jacob is not like these things, for he is the Former of everything, and Israel is the staff of his inheritance. Jehovah of armies is his name.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Gather up from the earth your pack load, O woman dwelling under stress.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am slinging out the inhabitants of the earth on this occasion, and I will cause them distress in order that they may find out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Woe to me on account of my breakdown! My stroke has become sickish. And I myself have said: “Surely this is my sickness, and I shall carry it.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">My own tent has been despoiled, and my own tent cords have all been torn in two. My own sons have gone forth from me, and they are no more. There is no one stretching out my tent anymore or raising up my tent cloths.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">For the shepherds have behaved unreasoningly, and they have not looked even for Jehovah. That is why they have not acted with insight, and all their pastured animals have been scattered.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Listen! A report! Here it has come, also a great pounding from the land of the north, in order to make the cities of Judah a desolate waste, the lair of jackals.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Correct me, O Jehovah, however with judgment; not in your anger, that you may not reduce me to nothing.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Pour out your rage upon the nations who have ignored you, and upon the families who have not called even upon your name. For they have eaten up Jacob. Yes, they have eaten him up, and they keep at exterminating him; and his abiding place they have desolated.</span>

       <span id="vs7">For I solemnly admonished <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers in the day of my bringing them up out of the land of Egypt and down to this day, rising up early and admonishing, saying: “Obey my voice.”</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But they did not listen or incline their ear, but they kept walking each one in the stubbornness of their bad heart; and so I brought upon them all the words of this covenant that I commanded [them] to do, but that they did not do.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Furthermore, Jehovah said to me: “Conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">They have returned to the errors of their forefathers, the first ones, who refused to obey my words, but who themselves have walked after other gods in order to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I concluded with their forefathers.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am bringing upon them a calamity that they will not be able to get out of; and they will certainly call to me for aid, but I shall not listen to them.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will have to go and call for aid to the gods to which they are making sacrificial smoke, but which will positively bring no salvation to them in the time of their calamity.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many altars as the streets of Jerusalem <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have placed for the shameful thing, altars to make sacrificial smoke to Ba&acute;al.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“And as for you, do not pray in behalf of this people, and do not lift up in their behalf an entreating cry or a prayer, for I shall not be listening in the time of their calling out to me in regard to their calamity.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“What business does my beloved one have in my house, that many of them should do this thing, the [evil] device? And with holy flesh will they make [it] pass over from upon you, when your calamity [comes]? At that time will you exult?</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">‘A luxuriant olive tree, pretty with fruit [and] in form,’ is what Jehovah has called your name. With sound of the great roaring, he has set a fire blazing against her, and they have broken its branches.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And Jehovah of armies himself, the Planter of you, has spoken against you a calamity on account of the badness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah that they have committed on their own part to offend me in making sacrificial smoke to Ba&acute;al.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And Jehovah himself has informed me that I may know. At that time you caused me to see their dealings.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I was like a male lamb, an intimate one, that is brought to slaughter, and I did not know that it was against me that they thought out schemes: “Let us bring to ruin the tree with its food, and let us cut him off from the land of the living ones, that his very name may no more be remembered.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; he is examining the kidneys and the heart. O may I see your vengeance on them, for it is to you that I have revealed my case at law.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said against the men of An&acute;a&middot;thoth who are seeking for your soul, saying: “You must not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you may not die at our hand”;</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Here I am turning my attention upon them. The young men themselves will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters themselves will die by the famine.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And not even a remnant will there come to be for them, because I shall bring calamity upon the men of An&acute;a&middot;thoth, the year of their being given attention.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">You are righteous, O Jehovah, when I make my complaint to you, indeed when I speak even about matters of judgment with you. Why is it that the way of wicked ones is what has succeeded, that all those who are committing treachery are the unworried ones?</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">You have planted them; they have also taken root. They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you yourself, O Jehovah, know me well; you see me, and you have examined my heart in union with yourself. Single them out like sheep for the slaughtering, and set them apart for the day of killing.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">How long should the land keep withering away, and the very vegetation of all the field dry up? Because of the badness of those dwelling in it the beasts and the flying creatures have been swept away. For they have said: “He does not see our future.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Because with footmen you have run, and they would tire you out, how, then, can you run a race with horses? And in the land of peace are you confident? So how will you act among the proud [thickets] along the Jordan?</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For even your own brothers and the household of your own father, even they themselves have dealt treacherously with you. Even they themselves have called out loudly behind you. Do not put any faith in them, just because they speak to you good things.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“I have left my house; I have deserted my inheritance; I have given the beloved one of my soul into the palm of her enemies.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She has let loose her voice even against me. That is why I have hated her.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">My inheritance is as a many-colored bird of prey to me; the birds of prey are round about upon it. Come, gather together, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> wild beasts of the field; bring [them] to eat.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Many shepherds themselves have brought my vineyard to ruin; they have stamped down my share. They have turned my desirable share into a wilderness of a desolate waste.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">One has made it a desolate waste; it has withered away; it is desolated to me. The whole land has been made desolate, because there is no man that has taken [it] to heart.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">On all the beaten paths through the wilderness the despoilers have come. For the sword belonging to Jehovah is devouring from one end of the land even to the other end of the land. There is no peace for any flesh.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">They have sown wheat, but thorns are what they have reaped. They have worked themselves sick; they will be of no benefit. And they will certainly be ashamed of the products of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people because of the burning anger of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">This is what Jehovah has said against all my bad neighbors, who are touching the hereditary possession that I caused my people, even Israel, to possess: “Here I am uprooting them from off their ground; and the house of Judah I shall uproot from the midst of them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And it must occur that after my uprooting them I shall again certainly have mercy upon them and will bring them back, each one to his hereditary possession and each one to his land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“And it must occur that if they will without fail learn the ways of my people in swearing by my name, ‘As Jehovah is alive!’ just as they taught my people to swear by Ba&acute;al, they will also be built up in the midst of my people.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">But if they will not obey, I will also uproot that nation, uprooting and destroying [it],” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">This is what Jehovah has said to me: “Go, and you must get for yourself a linen belt and put it upon your hips, but you must not bring it into any water.”</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">So I got the belt in accord with the word of Jehovah and put it upon my hips.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to me a second time, saying:</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“Take the belt that you got, that is upon your hips, and rise up, go to the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes, and hide it there in a cleft of the crag.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So I went and hid it by the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes, just as Jehovah had commanded me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But it came about at the end of many days that Jehovah proceeded to say to me: “Rise up, go to the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes and take from there the belt that I commanded you to hide there.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Accordingly I went to the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes and dug and took the belt from the place in which I had hid it, and, look! the belt had been ruined; it was not fit for anything.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Then the word of Jehovah occurred to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘In the same way I shall bring to ruin the pride of Judah and the abundant pride of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">This bad people who are refusing to obey my words, who are walking in the stubbornness of their heart and who keep walking after other gods in order to serve them and to bow down to them, will also become just like this belt that is fit for nothing.’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">‘For just as a belt clings to the hips of a man, so I caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling even to me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘in order to become to me a people and a name and a praise and something beautiful; but they did not obey.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“And you must say to them this word, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said: “Every large jar is something that gets filled with wine.”’ And they will certainly say to you, ‘Do we not positively know that every large jar is something that gets filled with wine?’</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And you must say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am filling all the inhabitants of this land and the kings that are sitting for David upon his throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And I will dash them one against another, both the fathers and the sons, at the same time,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “I shall show no compassion, nor feel any sorrow, and I shall not have the mercy to keep from bringing them to ruin.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“Hear, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, and give ear. Do not be haughty, for Jehovah himself has spoken.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Give to Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God glory, before he causes darkness and before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> feet strike up against each other on the mountains at dusk. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly hope for the light, and he will actually make it deep shadow; he will turn [it] into thick gloom.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not hear it, in places of concealment my soul will weep because of pride and will positively shed tears; and my eye will run down with tears, because the drove of Jehovah will have been carried captive.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Say to the king and to the lady, ‘Seat yourselves in a lower place, for down from <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heads <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> crown of beauty will certainly come.’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">The cities of the south themselves have been shut up, so that there is no one opening [them]. Judah in its entirety has been taken into exile. It has been taken into exile completely.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“Raise your eyes and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the drove that one gave to you, your beautiful flock?</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">What will you say when one turns his attention upon you, when you yourself have taught them as confidential friends right alongside you at the start? Will not birth pangs themselves seize hold of you, like those of a wife giving birth?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And when you will say in your heart, ‘Why is it that these things have befallen me?’ because of the abundance of your error your skirts have been taken off as a cover; your heels have been treated violently.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“Can a Cush&acute;ite change his skin? or a leopard its spots? Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves would also be able to do good, who are persons taught to do bad.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">So I shall scatter them like stubble that is passing along in the wind from the wilderness.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">This is your lot, your measured portion from me,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “because you have forgotten me and you keep putting your trust in falsehood.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And I myself also will lift up your skirts over your face, and your dishonor will certainly be seen,</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">your acts of adultery and your neighings, your loose conduct in prostitution. Upon the hills, in the field, I have seen your disgusting things. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! You cannot be clean—after how much longer?”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">[This is] what occurred as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah concerning the matters of the droughts:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Judah has gone mourning, and its very gates have faded away. They have become dejected to the earth, and even the outcry of Jerusalem has gone up.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And their majestic ones themselves have sent their insignificant ones for water. They have come to the ditches. They have found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty. They have been put to shame and have been disappointed, and they have covered their head.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">On account of the soil that has been shattered because there has occurred no downpour upon the land, the farmers have become ashamed; they have covered their head.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For even the hind in the field has given birth, but leaving [it], because there proved to be no tender grass.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the zebras themselves have stood still upon the bare hills; they have snuffed up the wind like the jackals; their eyes have failed because there is no vegetation.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Even if our own errors do testify against us, O Jehovah, act for the sake of your name; for our acts of unfaithfulness have become many; it is against you that we have sinned.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">O you the hope of Israel, the Savior of him in the time of distress, why do you become like an alien resident in the land, and like a traveler that has turned aside to spend the night?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Why do you become like a man astounded, like a mighty man that is unable to do any saving? Yet you yourself are in the midst of us, O Jehovah, and upon us it is that your own name has been called. Do not let us down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">This is what Jehovah has said concerning this people: “Thus they have loved to wander about; their feet they have not kept in check. So Jehovah himself has taken no pleasure in them. Now he will remember their error and will give attention to their sins.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Jehovah proceeded to say to me: “Do not pray in behalf of this people for any good.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">When they fast, I am not listening to their entreating cry; and when they offer up the whole burnt offering and the grain offering, I am taking no pleasure in them; for by the sword and by famine and by pestilence I am bringing them to their end.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">At this I said: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here the prophets are saying to them, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> will see no sword, and there will be no famine to happen to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, but true peace is what I shall give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in this place.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Falsehood is what the prophets are prophesying in my name. I have not sent them, nor have I commanded them or spoken to them. A false vision and divination and a valueless thing and the trickiness of their heart they are speaking prophetically to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my name and whom I myself did not send and who are saying that no sword or famine will occur in this land, ‘By sword and by famine those prophets will come to their finish.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And the very people to whom they are prophesying will become people cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, with no one to do the burying of them—them, their wives and their sons and their daughters. And I will pour out upon them their calamity.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And you must say to them this word, ‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not keep still, for with a great crash the virgin daughter of my people has been broken, with an extremely sickish stroke.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">If I actually go out into the field, look, now, those slain by the sword! And if I actually come into the city, look, also, the maladies from the famine! For both the prophet and the priest themselves have gone around to a land that they have not known.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Have you absolutely rejected Judah, or has your soul abhorred even Zion? Why is it that you have struck us, so that there is no healing for us? There was a hoping for peace, but no good [came]; and for a time of healing, and, look! terror!</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">We do acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, the error of our forefathers, for we have sinned against you.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Do not disrespect [us] for the sake of your name; do not despise your glorious throne. Remember; do not break your covenant with us.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Jehovah proceeded to say to me: “If Moses and Samuel were standing before me, my soul would not be toward this people. There would be a sending of them away from before my face, that they might go out.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And it must occur that should they say to you, ‘Where shall we go out to?’ you must also say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Whoever is for deadly plague, to deadly plague! And whoever is for the sword, to the sword! And whoever is for the famine, to the famine! And whoever is for the captivity, to the captivity!”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“‘And I will commission over them four families,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag away, and the flying creatures of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to eat and to bring to ruin.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I will give them for a quaking to all the kingdoms of the earth on account of Ma&middot;nas&acute;seh the son of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For who will show compassion upon you, O Jerusalem, and who will sympathize with you, and who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘You yourself have deserted me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘Backwards is the way you keep walking. And I shall stretch out my hand against you and bring you to ruin. I have got tired of feeling regret.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I shall winnow them with a fork in the gates of the land. I shall certainly bereave [them] of children. I will destroy my people, [since] they have not turned back from their own ways.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">To me their widows have become more numerous than the sand grains of the seas. I will bring for them, upon mother, young man, the despoiler at midday. I will cause to fall upon them suddenly excitement and disturbances.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The woman giving birth to seven has faded away; her soul has struggled for breath. Her sun has set while it is yet day; it has become ashamed and felt abashed.’ ‘And to the sword I shall give the mere remnant of them before their enemies,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Woe to me, O my mother, because you have given birth to me, a man subject to quarrel and a man subject to strife with all the earth. I have given no loan, and they have given me no loan. All of them are calling down evil upon me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Jehovah has said: “Surely I will minister to you for good. Surely I will intercede for you in the time of calamity and in the time of distress, against the enemy.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>

       <span id="vs14">And I will cause [them] to pass over with your enemies into a land that you have not known. For a fire itself has been ignited in my anger. Against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people it is kindled.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">You yourself have known. O Jehovah, remember me and turn your attention to me and avenge me upon my persecutors. In your slowness to anger do not take me away. Take note of my bearing reproach on account of your own self.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Your words were found, and I proceeded to eat them; and your word becomes to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heart; for your name has been called upon me, O Jehovah God of armies.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">I have not sat down in the intimate group of those playing jokes and begun exulting. Because of your hand I have sat down all by myself, for it is with denunciation that you have filled me.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Why has my pain become chronic and my stroke incurable? It has refused to be healed. You positively become to me like something deceitful, like waters that have proved untrustworthy.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “If you will come back, then I shall bring you back. Before me you will stand.

       <span id="vs1">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“You must not take for yourself a wife, and you must not come to have sons and daughters in this place.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For this is what Jehovah has said concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who are giving them birth and concerning their fathers who are causing their birth in this land,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">‘With deaths from maladies they will die. They will not be bewailed, neither will they be buried. As manure upon the surface of the ground they will become; and by the sword and by famine they will come to an end, and their dead bodies will actually serve as food for the flying creatures of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Do not enter into the house of a mourners’ feast, and do not go to bewail and do not sympathize with them.’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs5-2">“‘For I have taken away my peace from this people,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘even loving-kindness and mercies.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And they will certainly die, the great ones and the small ones, in this land. They will not be buried, neither will people beat themselves for them, nor will anyone make cuts upon himself or make himself bald for them.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And they will not deal out to them any bread on account of mourning to comfort someone over the dead; neither will they give them the cup of consolation to drink on account of one’s father and on account of one’s mother.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And you must enter no house of banqueting at all to sit down with them to eat and to drink.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am causing to cease out of this place before the eyes of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people and in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> days the voice of exultation and the voice of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“And it must occur that, when you tell to this people all these words and they actually say to you, ‘On what account has Jehovah spoken against us all this great calamity, and what is our error and what is our sin with which we have sinned against Jehovah our God?’</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">you must also say to them, ‘“On account of the fact that <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers left me,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and they kept going after other gods and serving them and bowing down to them. But me they left, and my law they did not keep.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves have acted worse in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> doing than <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers, and here <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are walking each one after the stubbornness of his bad heart in not obeying me.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I will hurl <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out from off this land into the land that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves have not known, neither <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> fathers, and there <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will have to serve other gods day and night, because I shall not give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> any favor.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘Therefore, look! days are coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘when it will no more be said: “As Jehovah is alive who brought the sons of Israel up out of the land of Egypt!”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">but: “As Jehovah is alive who brought the sons of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the lands to which he had dispersed them!” and I shall certainly bring them back to their soil, which I gave to their forefathers.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“‘Here I am sending for many fishers,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and they will certainly fish for them; and afterward I shall send for many hunters, and they will certainly hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the clefts of the crags.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">For my eyes are upon all their ways. They have not been concealed from before me, neither has their error been hid from in front of my eyes.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And, first of all, I will repay the full amount of their error and of their sin, on account of their profaning my land. With the corpses of their disgusting things and their detestable things they had filled my inheritance.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">O Jehovah my strength and my stronghold, and my place for flight in the day of distress, to you the nations themselves will come from the ends of the earth, and they will say: “Indeed our forefathers came to possess sheer falsehood, vanity and things in which there was nothing beneficial.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Can earthling man make for himself gods when they are no gods?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Therefore here I am causing them to know; at this one time I shall cause them to know my hand and my mightiness, and they will have to know that my name is Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">“The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars,</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">when their sons remember their altars and their sacred poles beside a luxuriant tree, upon the high hills,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">[on] the mountains in the field. Your resources, all your treasures, I shall give for mere plunder—your high places because of sin throughout all your territories.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you let loose, even of your own accord, from your hereditary possession that I had given you.

To time indefinite it will keep kindled.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>

       <span id="vs6">And he will certainly become like a solitary tree in the desert plain and will not see when good comes; but he must reside in parched places in the wilderness, in a salt country that is not inhabited.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And he will certainly become like a tree planted by the waters, that sends out its roots right by the watercourse; and he will not see when heat comes, but his foliage will actually prove to be luxuriant.

       <span id="vs11">[As] the partridge that has gathered together what it has not laid is the one making riches, but not with justice. At the half of his days he will leave them, and in his finale he will prove to be senseless.”</span>

       <span id="vs25">there will also certainly enter in by the gates of this city kings with princes, sitting on the throne of David, riding in the chariot and upon horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will certainly be inhabited to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">And people will actually come from the cities of Judah and from round about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the lowland and from the mountainous region and from the Neg&acute;eb, bringing whole burnt offering and sacrifice and grain offering and frankincense and bringing thanksgiving sacrifice into the house of Jehovah.</span>

       <span id="vs13">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “Ask for yourselves, please, among the nations. Who has heard things like these? There is a horrible thing that the virgin of Israel has done to an excess.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Will the snow of Leb&acute;a&middot;non go away from the rock of the open field? Or will strange waters, cool, trickling, be dried up?</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For my people have forgotten me in that they make sacrificial smoke to something worthless, and in that they make men stumble in their ways, the paths of long ago, to walk in roadways, a way not banked up,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">in order to make their land an object of astonishment, for whistling at to time indefinite. Every last one passing along by it will stare in astonishment and shake his head.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">As with an east wind I shall scatter them before the enemy. The back, and not the face, I shall show them in the day of their disaster.”</span>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And they proceeded to say: “Come, men, and let us think out against Jeremiah some thoughts, for the law will not perish from the priest or counsel from the wise one or the word from the prophet. Come and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us pay no attention to any of his words.”</span>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>

       <span id="vs20">Should bad be repaid for good? For they have excavated a pit for my soul. Remember my standing before you to speak good even concerning them, to turn back your rage from them.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Therefore give their sons over to the famine, and deliver them over to the power of the sword; and may their wives become women bereaved of children, and widows.

       <span id="vs22">Let a cry be heard out of their houses, when you bring upon them suddenly a marauder band. For they have excavated a pit to capture me, and traps they have hid for my feet.</span>

In the time of your anger take action against them.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now Pash&acute;hur the son of Im&acute;mer, the priest, who was also the leading commissioner in the house of Jehovah, kept listening to Jeremiah while prophesying these words.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Pash&acute;hur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him into the stocks that were in the Upper Gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">But it came about on the following day that Pash&acute;hur proceeded to let Jeremiah out from the stocks, and Jeremiah now said to him:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“Jehovah has called your name, not Pash&acute;hur, but Fright all around.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am making you a fright to yourself and to all your lovers, and they will certainly fall by the sword of their enemies while your eyes will be looking on; and all Judah I shall give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will actually take them into exile in Babylon and strike them down with the sword.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I will give all the stored-up things of this city and all its product and all its precious things; and all the treasures of the kings of Judah I am going to give into the hand of their enemies. And they will certainly plunder them and take them and bring them to Babylon.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And as for you, O Pash&acute;hur, and all the inhabitants of your house, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will go into captivity; and to Babylon you will come and there you will die and there you yourself will be buried with all your lovers, because you have prophesied to them in falsehood.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">You have fooled me, O Jehovah, so that I was fooled. You used your strength against me, so that you prevailed. I became an object of laughter all day long; everyone is holding me in derision.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">For as often as I speak, I cry out. Violence and despoiling are what I call out. For the word of Jehovah became for me a cause for reproach and for jeering all day long.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And I said: “I am not going to make mention of him, and I shall speak no more in his name.” And in my heart it proved to be like a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I got tired of holding in, and I was unable [to endure it].</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For I heard the bad report of many. There was fright all around. “T<span class="smallcaps">ELL</span> out, that we may tell out about him.” Every mortal man bidding me “Peace!”—they are watching for my limping: “Perhaps he will be fooled, so that we may prevail against him and take our revenge upon him.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But Jehovah was with me like a terrible mighty one. That is why the very ones persecuting me will stumble and not prevail. They will certainly be put to much shame, because they will not have prospered. [Their] indefinitely lasting humiliation will be one that will not be forgotten.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">But you, O Jehovah of armies, are examining the righteous one; you are seeing the kidneys and the heart. May I see your vengeance upon them, for to you I have revealed my case at law.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Sing to Jehovah, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! Praise Jehovah! For he has delivered the soul of the poor one out of the hand of evildoers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Cursed be the day on which I was born! May the day that my mother gave me birth not become blessed!</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Cursed be the man that brought good news to my father, saying: “There has been born to you a son, a male!” He positively made him rejoice.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And that very man must become like cities that Jehovah has overthrown while He has felt no regret. And he must hear an outcry in the morning and an alarm signal at the time of midday.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Why did he not definitely put me to death from the womb, that my mother should become to me my burial place and her womb be pregnant to time indefinite?</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Why is it that I have come forth from the very womb in order to see hard work and grief and that my days should come to their end in mere shame?</span>

       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah sent to him Pash&acute;hur the son of Mal&middot;chi&acute;ah and Zeph&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah, the priest, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Please inquire in our behalf of Jehovah, because Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps Jehovah will do with us according to all his wonderful works, so that he will withdraw from us.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And Jeremiah proceeded to say to them: “This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will say to Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said: “Here I am turning in reverse the weapons of war that are in the hand of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, with which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are fighting the king of Babylon, and the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who are laying siege against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> outside the wall, and I will gather them into the middle of this city.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And I myself will fight against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> with a stretched-out hand and with a strong arm and with anger and with rage and with great indignation.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. With a great pestilence they will die.”’</span>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“‘“And after that,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “I shall give Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and his servants and the people and those who are remaining over in this city from the pestilence, from the sword and from the famine, into the hand of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon, even into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who are seeking for their soul, and he will certainly strike them with the edge of the sword. He will not feel sorry for them, nor will he show compassion or have any mercy.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“And to this people you will say, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am putting before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people the way of life and the way of death.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">The one sitting still in this city will die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence; but the one who is going out and who actually falls away to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who are laying siege against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will keep living, and his soul will certainly come to be his as a spoil.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“‘“For I have set my face against this city for calamity and not for good,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “Into the hand of the king of Babylon it will be given, and he will certainly burn it with fire.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“‘And as regards the household of the king of Judah, hear, O men, the word of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">O house of David, this is what Jehovah has said: “Every morning render sentence in justice, and deliver the one being robbed out of the hand of the defrauder, that my rage may not go forth just like a fire and actually burn and there be no one to extinguish it because of the badness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“‘Here I am against you, O inhabitress of the low plain, O rock of the level land,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are saying: “Who will descend against us?

       <span id="vs14">I will also hold an accounting against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> according to the fruitage of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘And I will set a fire ablaze in her forest, and it will certainly devour all the things round about her.’”</span>

       <span id="vs10">For it is with adulterers that the land has become full. For because of the curse the land has gone to mourning, the pasture grounds of the wilderness have dried up; and their course of action proves to be bad, and their mightiness is not right.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“For both the prophet and the priest themselves have become polluted. Also in my own house I have found their badness,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Therefore their way will become for them like slippery places in the gloom, into which they will be pushed and certainly fall.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs12-2">“For I shall bring upon them a calamity, the year of their being given attention,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“And in the prophets of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a I have seen impropriety. They have acted as prophets [incited] by Ba&acute;al, and they keep making my people, even Israel, wander about.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen horrible things, committing adultery and walking in falsehood; and they have strengthened the hands of evildoers in order that they should not return, each one from his own badness. To me all of them have become like Sod&acute;om, and the inhabitants of her like Go&middot;mor&acute;rah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said against the prophets: “Here I am making them eat wormwood, and I will give them poisoned water to drink. For from the prophets of Jerusalem apostasy has gone forth to all the land.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people. They are making <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> become vain. The vision of their own heart is what they speak—not from the mouth of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">They are saying again and again to those who are disrespectful of me, ‘Jehovah has spoken: “Peace is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will come to have.”’ And [to] every one walking in the stubbornness of his heart they have said, ‘No calamity will come upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people.’</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">For who has stood in the intimate group of Jehovah that he might see and hear his word? Who has given attention to his word that he might hear it?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Look! The windstorm of Jehovah, rage itself, will certainly go forth, even a whirling tempest. Upon the head of the wicked ones it will whirl itself.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">The anger of Jehovah will not turn back until he will have carried out and until he will have made the ideas of his heart come true. In the final part of the days <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will give <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> consideration to it with understanding.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“I did not send the prophets, yet they themselves ran. I did not speak to them, yet they themselves prophesied.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But if they had stood in my intimate group, then they would have made my people hear my own words, and they would have caused them to turn back from their bad way and from the badness of their dealings.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">“Am I a God nearby,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and not a God far away?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Or can any man be concealed in places of concealment and I myself not see him?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs24-2">“Is it not the heavens and the earth that I myself actually fill?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“I have heard what the prophets who are prophesying falsehood in my own name have said, saying, ‘I have had a dream! I have had a dream!’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">How long will it exist in the heart of the prophets who are prophesying the falsehood and who are prophets of the trickiness of their own heart?</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">They are thinking of making my people forget my name by means of their dreams that they keep relating each one to the other, just as their fathers forgot my name by means of Ba&acute;al.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">The prophet with whom there is a dream, let him relate the dream; but the one with whom my own word is, let him speak forth my word truthfully.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs28-2">“What does the straw have to do with the grain?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“Is not my word correspondingly like a fire,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and like a forge hammer that smashes the crag?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“Therefore here I am against the prophets,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “the ones who are stealing away my words, each one from his companion.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Here I am against the prophets,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “the ones who are employing their tongue that they may utter forth, ‘An utterance!’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“Here I am against the prophets of false dreams,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “who relate them and cause my people to wander about because of their falsehoods and because of their boasting.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs32-2">“But I myself did not send them or command them. So they will by no means benefit this people,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“And when this people or the prophet or priest asks you, saying, ‘What is the burden of Jehovah?’ you must also say to them, ‘“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> people are—O what a burden! And I shall certainly abandon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">As for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The burden of Jehovah!’ I will also turn my attention upon that man and upon his household.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep saying each one to his fellow and each one to his brother, ‘What has Jehovah answered? And what has Jehovah spoken?’</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">But the burden of Jehovah mention no more <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people, for the burden itself becomes to each one his own word, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have changed the words of the living God, Jehovah of armies, our God.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“This is what you will say to the prophet, ‘What answer has Jehovah given you? And what has Jehovah spoken?</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And if “The burden of Jehovah!” is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> keep on saying, therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “By reason of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> saying, ‘This word is the very burden of Jehovah,’ when I kept sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must not say: “The burden of Jehovah!”’</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">therefore here I am! And I will give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people to neglect, with finality, and I will desert <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and the city that I gave to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers—from before me.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And I will put upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> reproach to time indefinite and humiliation to time indefinite, which will not be forgotten.”’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">In the beginning of the royal rule of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, the king of Judah, this word occurred from Jehovah, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Stand in the courtyard of the house of Jehovah, and you must speak concerning all the cities of Judah that are coming in to bow down at the house of Jehovah all the words that I will command you to speak to them. Do not take away a word.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Perhaps they will listen and return, each one from his bad way, and I shall have to feel regret for the calamity that I am thinking to execute upon them because of the badness of their dealings.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And you must say to them: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not listen to me by walking in my law that I have put before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">by listening to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I am sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, even rising up early and sending [them], whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not listened to,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">I will, in turn, make this house like that in Shi&acute;loh, and this city I shall make a malediction to all the nations of the earth.’”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the priests and the prophets and all the people began to hear Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So it came about that when Jeremiah had completed speaking all that Jehovah had commanded [him] to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying: “You will positively die.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Why is it that you have prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, ‘Like that in Shi&acute;loh is how this house will become, and this very city will be devastated so as to be without an inhabitant’?” And all the people kept congregating themselves about Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">In time the princes of Judah got to hear these words, and they proceeded to come up from the house of the king to the house of Jehovah and to sit down in the entrance of the new gate of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the priests and the prophets began to say to the princes and to all the people: “To this man the judgment of death belongs, because he has prophesied concerning this city just as <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have heard with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own ears.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that Jeremiah said to all the princes and to all the people: “It was Jehovah that sent me to prophesy concerning this house and concerning this city all the words that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have heard.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And now make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ways and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings good, and obey the voice of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, and Jehovah will feel regret for the calamity that he has spoken against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And as for me, here I am in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hand. Do to me according to what is good and according to what is right in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> eyes.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Only <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should by all means know that, if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are putting me to death, it is innocent blood that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are putting upon yourselves and upon this city and upon her inhabitants, for in truth Jehovah did send me to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to speak in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ears all these words.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: “There is no judgment of death belonging to this man, for it was in the name of Jehovah our God that he spoke to us.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Furthermore, certain ones of the older men of the land rose up and began saying to all the congregation of the people:</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“Mi&acute;cah of Mo&acute;resh&middot;eth himself happened to be prophesying in the days of Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and went on to say to all the people of Judah, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Zion herself will be plowed up as a mere field, and Jerusalem herself will become mere heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the House will be for high places of a forest.”’</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Did Hez&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and all those of Judah by any means put him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah and proceed to soften the face of Jehovah, so that Jehovah got to feeling regret for the calamity that he had spoken against them? So we are working up a great calamity against our souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And there also happened to be a man prophesying in the name of Jehovah, U&middot;ri&acute;jah the son of She&middot;mai&acute;ah from Kir&acute;i&middot;ath-je&acute;a&middot;rim. And he kept prophesying against this city and against this land in accord with all the words of Jeremiah.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And King Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim and all his mighty men and all the princes got to hear his words, and the king began seeking to put him to death. When U&middot;ri&acute;jah got to hear [of it] he at once became afraid and ran away and came into Egypt.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">But King Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim sent men to Egypt, El&middot;na&acute;than the son of Ach&acute;bor and other men with him to Egypt.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And they proceeded to bring U&middot;ri&acute;jah out from Egypt and to bring him to King Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim, who then struck him down with the sword and cast his dead body into the graveyard of the sons of the people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Moreover, it was the hand of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan that proved to be with Jeremiah, in order not to give him into the hand of the people to have him put to death.</span>

       <span id="vs19">due to the fact that they have not listened to my words,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘that I have sent to them with my servants the prophets, getting up early and sending [them].’</span>

       <span id="vs25">‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “For the reason that you yourself have sent in your name letters to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zeph&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">‘Jehovah himself has made you priest instead of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;da the priest, in order to become the grand overseer of the house of Jehovah toward any man maddened and behaving like a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the pillory;</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">now, then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of An&acute;a&middot;thoth, who is behaving as a prophet to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">For that is why he has sent to us at Babylon, saying: “It is long drawn out! Build houses and inhabit [them], and plant gardens and eat their fruitage,—”’”’”</span>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Write for yourself in a book all the words that I will speak to you.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For, “look! there are days coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will gather the captive ones of my people, Israel and Judah,” Jehovah has said, “and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they will certainly repossess it.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And these are the words that Jehovah has spoken to Israel and to Judah.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">For this is what Jehovah has said: “The sound of trembling we have heard, dread, and there is no peace.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Ask, please, O men, and see whether a male is giving birth. Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Alas! For that day is a great one, so that there is no other like it, and it is the time of distress for Jacob. But he will be saved even out of it.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“And it must occur in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, “that I shall break one’s yoke from off your neck, and your bands I shall tear in two, and no more will strangers exploit him as a servant.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And they will certainly serve Jehovah their God and David their king, whom I shall raise up for them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“And as for you, do not be afraid, O my servant Jacob,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and do not be struck with terror, O Israel. For here I am saving you from far off and your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will certainly return and be free of disturbance and be at ease, and there will be no one causing trembling.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“For I am with you,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “to save you; but I shall make an extermination among all the nations to which I have scattered you. However, in your case I shall make no extermination. And I shall have to correct you to the proper degree, as I shall by no means leave you unpunished.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this is what Jehovah has said: “There is no cure for your breakdown. Your stroke is chronic.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">There is no one pleading your cause, for [your] ulcer. There are no means of healing, no mending, for you.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">All those intensely loving you are the ones that have forgotten you. You are not the one for whom they keep searching. For with the stroke of an enemy I have struck you, with the chastisement of someone cruel, on account of the abundance of your error; your sins have become numerous.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Why do you cry out on account of your breakdown? Your pain is incurable on account of the abundance of your error; your sins have become numerous. I have done these things to you.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Therefore all those devouring you will themselves be devoured; and as for all your adversaries, into captivity they will all of them go. And those pillaging you will certainly come to be for pillaging, and all those plundering you I shall give over to plundering.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“For I shall bring up a recuperation for you, and from your strokes I shall heal you,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “For a woman chased away is what they called you: ‘That is Zion, for whom no one is searching.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am gathering the captive ones of the tents of Jacob, and for his tabernacles I shall have pity. And the city will actually be rebuilt upon her mound; and upon its rightful site the dwelling tower itself will sit.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And from them there will certainly go forth thanksgiving, and the sound of those who are laughing. And I will multiply them, and they will not become few; and I will make them heavy in number, and they will not become insignificant.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And his sons must become as in former times, and before me his own assembly will be firmly established. And I will turn my attention upon all his oppressors.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And his majestic one will certainly come to be from him, and from the midst of him his own ruler will go forth; and I will cause him to come near, and he must approach to me.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs21-2">“For who, now, is this one that has given his heart in pledge in order to approach to me?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly become my people, and I myself shall become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Look! A windstorm of Jehovah, rage itself, has gone forth, an onward-sweeping tempest. Upon the head of the wicked ones it will whirl.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">The burning anger of Jehovah will not turn back until he will have executed and until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart. In the final part of the days <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will give <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> consideration to it.</span>

</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">This is what Jehovah has said: “The people made up of survivors from the sword found favor in the wilderness, when Israel was walking to get his repose.”</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">From far away Jehovah himself appeared to me, [saying:] “And with a love to time indefinite I have loved you. That is why I have drawn you with loving-kindness.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Yet shall I rebuild you and you will actually be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel. You will yet deck yourself with your tambourines and actually go forth in the dance of those who are laughing.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">You will yet plant vineyards in the mountains of Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a. The planters will certainly plant and start to use [them].</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">For there exists a day when the lookouts in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im will actually call out, ‘Rise up, O men, and let us go up to Zion, to Jehovah our God.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For this is what Jehovah has said: “C<span class="smallcaps">RY</span> out loudly to Jacob with rejoicing, and <span class="smallcaps">CRY</span> shrilly at the head of nations. P<span class="smallcaps">UBLISH</span> [it].

       <span id="vs9">With weeping they will come, and with [their] entreaties for favor I shall bring them. I shall make them walk to torrent valleys of water, in a right way in which they will not be caused to stumble. For I have become to Israel a Father; and as for E&acute;phra&middot;im, he is my firstborn.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Hear the word of Jehovah, O <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> nations, and tell [it] among the islands far away, and say: “The One scattering Israel will himself collect him together, and he will certainly keep him as a shepherd does his drove.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>

       <span id="vs12">And they will certainly come and cry out joyfully on the height of Zion and become radiant over the goodness of Jehovah, over the grain and over the new wine and over the oil and over the young ones of the flock and the cattle. And their soul will simply become like a well-watered garden, and no more will they languish again.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“At that time the virgin will rejoice in the dance, also the young men and the old men, all together. And I will change their mourning into exultation, and I will comfort them and make them rejoice away from their grief.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And I will saturate the soul of the priests with fatness, and with my goodness my own people will become satisfied,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘In Ra&acute;mah a voice is being heard, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping over her sons. She has refused to be comforted over her sons, because they are no more.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">This is what Jehovah has said: “‘Hold back your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there exists a reward for your activity,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and they will certainly return from the land of the enemy.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>

       <span id="vs18">“I have positively heard E&acute;phra&middot;im bemoaning himself, ‘You have corrected me, that I may be corrected, like a calf that has not been trained. Cause me to turn back, and I shall readily turn back, for you are Jehovah my God.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">For after my turning back I felt regret; and after my being led to know I made a slap upon the thigh. I became ashamed, and I also felt humiliated, for I had carried the reproach of my youth.’”</span>

       <span id="vs20">“Is E&acute;phra&middot;im a precious son to me, or a fondly treated child? For to the extent of my speaking against him I shall without fail remember him further. That is why my intestines have become boisterous for him. By all means I shall have pity upon him,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Set up road marks for yourself. Place signposts for yourself. Fix your heart upon the highway, the way that you will have to go. Come back, O virgin of Israel. Come back to these cities of yours.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">How long will you turn this way and that, O unfaithful daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth: A mere female will press around an able-bodied man.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “They will yet say this word in the land of Judah and in his cities, when I shall gather their captives, ‘May Jehovah bless you, O righteous dwelling place, O holy mountain.’</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And in it Judah and all his cities will certainly dwell all together, farmers and those who have set out with the drove.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">For I will saturate the tired soul, and every languishing soul I will fill.”</span>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">At this thing I awoke and began to see; and as for my sleep, it had been pleasurable to me.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“Look! There are days coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of domestic animal.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“And it must occur that just as I had kept alert toward them to uproot and to pull down and to tear down and to destroy and to do damage, so I shall keep alert toward them to build up and to plant,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“In those days they will no more say, ‘The fathers were the ones that ate the unripe grape, but it was the teeth of the sons that got set on edge.’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">But it will be each one for his own error that one will die. Any man eating the unripe grape, his will be the teeth that will be set on edge.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Look! There are days coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">not one like the covenant that I concluded with their forefathers in the day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, ‘which covenant of mine they themselves broke, although I myself had husbandly ownership of them,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“For this is the covenant that I shall conclude with the house of Israel after those days,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “I will put my law within them, and in their heart I shall write it. And I will become their God, and they themselves will become my people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“And they will no more teach each one his companion and each one his brother, saying, ‘K<span class="smallcaps">NOW</span> Jehovah!’ for they will all of them know me, from the least one of them even to the greatest one of them,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “For I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">This is what Jehovah, the Giver of the sun for light by day, the statutes of the moon and the stars for light by night, the One stirring up the sea that its waves may become boisterous, the One whose name is Jehovah of armies, has said:</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“‘If these regulations could be removed from before me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘those who are the seed of Israel could likewise cease from proving to be a nation before me always.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">This is what Jehovah has said: “‘If the heavens up above could be measured and the foundations of the earth below could be searched out, I myself also could reject the entire seed of Israel on account of all that they have done,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“Look! There are days coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and the city will certainly be built to Jehovah from the Tower of Ha&middot;nan&acute;el to the Corner Gate.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And the line for measurement will yet actually go forth straight ahead to the hill of Ga&acute;reb, and it will certainly go around to Go&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And all the low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes, and all the terraces as far as the torrent valley of Kid&acute;ron, clear to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the sunrising, will be something holy to Jehovah. It will not be uprooted, neither will it be torn down anymore to time indefinite.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah, that is, the eighteenth year of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And at that time the military forces of the king of Babylon were laying siege to Jerusalem; and as for Jeremiah the prophet, he happened to be under restraint in the Courtyard of the Guard that is in the house of the king of Judah;</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">because Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah had restrained him, saying:</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs3-2">“Why is it that you are prophesying, saying, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will certainly capture it;</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah himself, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, for he will without fail be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth will actually speak with the mouth of that one, and his own eyes will see even the eyes of that one”’;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">‘and to Babylon he will take Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah, and there he will continue until I turn my attention to him,’ is the utterance of Jehovah; ‘although <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men keep warring against the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will not succeed’?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Jeremiah proceeded to say: “The word of Jehovah has occurred to me, saying,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">‘Here is Han&acute;a&middot;mel the son of Shal&acute;lum your paternal uncle coming in to you, saying: “Buy for yourself the field of mine that is in An&acute;a&middot;thoth, because the right of repurchase belongs to you for buying [it].”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">In time Han&acute;a&middot;mel the son of my paternal uncle came in to me, according to the word of Jehovah, into the Courtyard of the Guard, and proceeded to say to me: “Buy, please, the field of mine that is in An&acute;a&middot;thoth, which is in the land of Benjamin, for the right of hereditary possession is yours, and the repurchasing power is yours. Buy [it] for yourself.” At that I knew that it had been the word of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">So I proceeded to buy from Han&acute;a&middot;mel the son of my paternal uncle the field that was in An&acute;a&middot;thoth. And I began to weigh out to him the money, seven shekels and ten silver pieces.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then I wrote in a deed and affixed the seal and took witnesses as I went weighing the money in the scales.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">After that I took the deed of purchase, the one sealed according to the commandment and the regulations, and the one left open;</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">and I then gave the deed of purchase to Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Mah&middot;sei&acute;ah before the eyes of Han&acute;a&middot;mel [the son of] my paternal uncle and before the eyes of the witnesses, those writing in the deed of purchase, before the eyes of all the Jews who were sitting in the Courtyard of the Guard.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">I now commanded Bar&acute;uch before their eyes, saying:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Taking these deeds, this deed of purchase, even the sealed one, and the other deed left open, you must also put them into an earthenware vessel, in order that they may last for many days.’</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Houses and fields and vineyards will yet be bought in this land.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And I began to pray to Jehovah after my having given the deed of purchase to Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah, saying:</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here you yourself have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. The whole matter is not too wonderful for you yourself,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">the One exercising loving-kindness toward thousands, and repaying the error of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them, the [true] God, the great One, the mighty One, Jehovah of armies being his name,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">great in counsel and abundant in acts, you whose eyes are opened upon all the ways of the sons of men, in order to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruitage of his dealings;</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">you who set signs and miracles in the land of Egypt down to this day and in Israel and among men, that you might make a name for your own self, just as at this day.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And you proceeded to bring forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt, with signs and with miracles and with a strong hand and with a stretched-out arm and with great fearsomeness.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“In time you gave them this land that you swore to their forefathers to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And they proceeded to come in and take possession of it, but they did not obey your voice, and in your law they did not walk. All the things that you commanded them to do they did not do, so that you caused all this calamity to befall them.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Look! With siege ramparts men have come to the city to capture it, and the very city will certainly be given into the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who are fighting against it, because of the sword and the famine and the pestilence; and what you have said has happened, and here you are seeing [it].</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Yet you yourself have said to me, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘Buy for yourself the field with money and take witnesses,’ although the city itself must be given into the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">At that the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“Here I am, Jehovah, the God of all flesh. For me is there any matter at all too wonderful?</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am giving this city into the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans and into the hand of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon, and he must capture it.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who are fighting against this city must come in and set this city aflame with fire and must burn it down and the houses upon the roofs of which they have made sacrificial smoke to Ba&acute;al and have poured out drink offerings to other gods for the purpose of offending me.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“‘For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have proved to be mere doers of what was bad in my eyes, from their youth on up; for the sons of Israel are even offending me by the work of their hands,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">‘For this city, from the day that they built it, clear down to this day, has proved to be nothing but a cause of anger in me and a cause of rage in me, in order to remove it from before my face,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">on account of all the badness of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah that they have done to offend me, they, their kings, their princes, their priests and their prophets, and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And they kept turning to me the back and not the face; though there was a teaching of them, a rising up early and teaching, but there were none of them listening to receive discipline.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And they went putting their disgusting things in the house upon which my own name has been called, in order to defile it.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">Furthermore, they built the high places of Ba&acute;al that are in the valley of the son of Hin&acute;nom, in order to make their sons and their daughters pass through [the fire] to Mo&acute;lech, a thing that I did not command them, neither did it come up into my heart to do this detestable thing, for the purpose of making Judah sin.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">“And now, therefore, this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said concerning this city which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> persons are saying will certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence,</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">‘Here I am collecting them together out of all the lands to which I shall have dispersed them in my anger and in my rage and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in security.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">And they will certainly become my people, and I myself shall become their God.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">And I will give them one heart and one way in order to fear me always, for good to them and to their sons after them.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">And I will conclude with them an indefinitely lasting covenant, that I shall not turn back from behind them, for me to do them good; and the fear of me I shall put in their heart in order not to turn aside from me.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">And I will exult over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in trueness with all my heart and with all my soul.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Just as I have brought in upon this people all this great calamity, so I am bringing in upon them all the goodness that I am speaking concerning them.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">And fields will certainly be bought in this land of which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will be saying: “It is a desolate waste without man and domestic animal. It has been given into the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“‘With money people will buy fields themselves, and there will be a recording in the deed and a sealing and a taking of witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the surroundings of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountainous region and in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south, because I shall bring back their captives,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the Courtyard of the Guard, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah the Maker of [earth] has said, Jehovah the Former of it to establish it firmly, Jehovah being his name,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">‘Call to me, and I shall answer you and readily tell you great and incomprehensible things that you have not known.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah that are pulled down on account of the siege ramparts and on account of the sword;</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">[concerning] those who are coming to fight against the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans and to fill places with the carcasses of the men whom I have struck down in my anger and in my rage, and on account of all whose badness I have concealed my face from this city,</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">‘Here I am bringing up for her a recuperation and health; and I will heal them and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And I will bring back the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel, and I will build them just as at the start.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And I will purify them from all their error with which they have sinned against me, and I will forgive all their errors with which they have sinned against me and with which they have transgressed against me.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And she will certainly become to me a name of exultation, a praise and a beauty toward all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the goodness that I am rendering to them. And they will certainly be in dread and be agitated on account of all the goodness and on account of all the peace that I am rendering to her.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘In this place that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will be saying is waste without man and without domestic animal, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolated without man and without inhabitant and without domestic animal, there will yet be heard</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying: “L<span class="smallcaps">AUD</span> Jehovah of armies, for Jehovah is good; for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness!”’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-2">“‘They will be bringing a thanksgiving offering into the house of Jehovah, for I shall bring back the captives of the land just as at the start,’ Jehovah has said.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘In this waste place without man and even domestic animal and in all its cities there will yet come to be the pasture ground of the shepherds who are making the flock lie down.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“‘In the cities of the mountainous region, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south and in the land of Benjamin and in the surroundings of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah flocks will yet pass by under the hands of the one taking the count,’ Jehovah has said.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“‘Look! There are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I shall certainly carry out the good word that I have spoken, concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">In those days and at that time I shall make sprout for David a righteous sprout, and he will certainly execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem itself will reside in security. And this is what she will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘There will not be cut off in David’s case a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And in the case of the priests, the Levites, there will not be cut off a man from before me to offer up whole burnt offering and to make smoke with a grain offering and to render sacrifice always.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the word of Jehovah came further to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people could break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, even in order for day and night not to occur in their time,</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">likewise could my own covenant be broken with David my servant so that he should not come to have a son ruling as king upon his throne; also with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Just as the army of the heavens cannot be counted, neither the sand of the sea be measured, so I shall multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites who are ministering to me.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Have you not seen what those of this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families whom Jehovah has chosen, he will also reject them’? And my own people they keep treating with disrespect, so that it should no more continue being a nation before them.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘If it was not a fact that I had appointed my own covenant of the day and night, the statutes of heaven and earth,</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">so too I would reject even the seed of Jacob and of David my servant, so that I should not take from his seed rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I shall gather their captives and will have pity upon them.’”</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon and all his military force and all the kingdoms of the earth, the dominion under his hand, and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and against all her cities, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Go, and you must say to Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah, yes, you must say to him: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he must burn it with fire.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And you yourself will not escape out of his hand, because you will without fail be caught and into his hand you will be given. And your own eyes will see even the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his own mouth will speak even with your mouth, and to Babylon you will come.’</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">However, hear the word of Jehovah, O Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah king of Judah, ‘This is what Jehovah has said concerning you: “You will not die by the sword.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">In peace you will die; and as with the burnings for your fathers, the former kings who happened to be prior to you, so they will make a burning for you, and ‘Alas, O master!’ is what they will say in lament for you, for ‘I myself have spoken the very word,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”’”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And Jeremiah the prophet proceeded to speak to Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem,</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">when the military forces of the king of Babylon were fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left remaining, against La&acute;chish and against A&middot;ze&acute;kah; for they, the fortified cities, were the ones that remained over among the cities of Judah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">The word that occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah after King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah concluded a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim to them liberty,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">to let each one his manservant and each one his maidservant, Hebrew man and Hebrew woman, go free, in order not to use them as servants, that is, a Jew, who is his brother.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">So all the princes obeyed, and all the people who had entered into the covenant to let each one his manservant and each one his maidservant go free, in order to use them no more as servants, and they proceeded to obey and to let [them] go.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But they turned about after that and began to bring back the menservants and the maidservants whom they had let go free, and they went subjecting them as menservants and as maidservants.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘I myself concluded a covenant with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers in the day of my bringing them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, saying:</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“At the end of seven years <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men should let go each one his brother, a Hebrew man, who came to be sold to you and who has served you six years; and you must let him go free from being with you.” But <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers did not listen to me, neither did they incline their ear.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves turn around today and do what is upright in my eyes in proclaiming liberty each one to his companion, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> conclude a covenant before me in the house upon which my name has been called.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Then <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> turn back and profane my name and bring back each one his manservant and each one his maidservant, whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> let go free agreeably to their soul, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> subject them to become <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> menservants and maidservants.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves have not obeyed me in keeping on proclaiming liberty each one to his brother and each one to his companion. Here I am proclaiming to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a liberty,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine, and I shall certainly give <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for a quaking to all the kingdoms of the earth.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I will give the men sidestepping my covenant, in that they did not carry out the words of the covenant that they concluded before me [with] the calf that they cut in two that they might pass between its pieces;</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">[namely,] the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, the court officials and the priests and all the people of the land who went passing between the pieces of the calf—</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">yes, I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking for their soul; and their dead bodies must become food for the flying creatures of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and his princes I shall give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking for their soul and into the hand of the military forces of the king of Babylon who are withdrawing from against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">“‘Here I am commanding,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I shall certainly bring them back to this city, and they must fight against it and capture it and burn it with fire; and the cities of Judah I shall make a desolate waste without an inhabitant.’”</span>

       <span id="vs2">“Go to the house of the Re&acute;cha&middot;bites, and you must speak with them and bring them into the house of Jehovah, to one of the dining rooms; and you must give them wine to drink.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">So I took Ja&middot;az&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Jeremiah the son of Hab&middot;az&middot;zi&middot;ni&acute;ah and his brothers, and all his sons, and all the household of the Re&acute;cha&middot;bites,</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">and I proceeded to bring them into the house of Jehovah, to the dining room of the sons of Ha&acute;nan the son of Ig&middot;da&middot;li&acute;ah, a man of the [true] God, which was beside the dining room of the princes that was above the dining room of Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the son of Shal&acute;lum the doorkeeper.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then I put before the sons of the house of the Re&acute;cha&middot;bites cups full of wine and goblets and said to them: “Drink wine.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">But they said: “We shall drink no wine, because Jon&acute;a&middot;dab the son of Re&acute;chab, our forefather, was the one that laid the command upon us, saying, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> must drink no wine, neither <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> nor <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> sons, to time indefinite.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And no house must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> build, and no seed must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sow; and no vineyard must <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> plant, nor must it come to be <span class="smallcaps">YOURS</span>. But in tents <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should dwell all <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> days, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may keep living many days upon the surface of the ground where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are residing as aliens.’</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So we keep obeying the voice of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;dab the son of Re&acute;chab our forefather in everything that he commanded us by drinking no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons and our daughters,</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and by not building houses for us to dwell in, so that no vineyard or field or seed should become ours.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And we keep dwelling in tents and obeying and doing according to all that Jon&acute;a&middot;dab our forefather commanded us.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">But it came about when Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon came up against the land that we began to say, ‘Come, and let us enter into Jerusalem because of the military force of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans and because of the military force of the Syrians, and let us dwell in Jerusalem.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Go, and you must say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “Did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> not continually receive exhortation to obey my words?” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“There has been a carrying out of the words of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;dab the son of Re&acute;chab, that he commanded his sons, to drink no wine, and they have drunk none down to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their forefather. And as for me, I have spoken to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men, rising up early and speaking, but <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have not obeyed me.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And I kept sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending [them], saying, ‘Turn back, please, each one from his bad way, and make <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings good, and do not walk after other gods to serve them. And keep dwelling on the ground that I have given to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.’ But <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not incline <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> ear, nor did <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> listen to me.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">But the sons of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;dab the son of Re&acute;chab have carried out the commandment of their forefather that he commanded them; but as for this people, they have not listened to me.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity that I have spoken against them, for the reason that I have spoken to them but they did not listen, and I kept calling to them but they did not answer.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And to the household of the Re&acute;cha&middot;bites Jeremiah said: “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘For the reason that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have obeyed the commandment of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;dab <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefather and continue keeping all his commandments and doing according to all that he commanded <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “There will not be cut off from Jon&acute;a&middot;dab the son of Re&acute;chab a man to stand before me always.”’”</span>

       <span id="vs1">Now it came about in the fourth year of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, the king of Judah, that this word occurred to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Take for yourself a roll of a book, and you must write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations, since the day that I spoke to you, since the days of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, clear down to this day.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Perhaps those of the house of Judah will listen to all the calamity that I am thinking of doing to them, to the end that they may return, each one from his bad way, and that I may actually forgive their error and their sin.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jeremiah proceeded to call Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah that Bar&acute;uch might write at the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah that He had spoken to him, on the roll of the book.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">Then Jeremiah commanded Bar&acute;uch, saying: “I am shut up. I am unable to enter into the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And you yourself must enter in and read aloud from the roll that you have written at my mouth the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people at the house of Jehovah in the day of fast; and also in the ears of all Judah who are coming in from their cities you should read them aloud.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Perhaps their request for favor will fall before Jehovah and they will return, each one from his bad way, for great is the anger and the rage that Jehovah has spoken against this people.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah proceeded to do according to all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him, to read aloud from the book the words of Jehovah at the house of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now it came about in the fifth year of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem and all the people that were coming in from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Bar&acute;uch began to read aloud from the book the words of Jeremiah at the house of Jehovah, in the dining room of Gem&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Sha&acute;phan the copyist, in the upper courtyard, at the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah the son of Gem&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Sha&acute;phan got to hear all the words of Jehovah from out of the book.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">At that he went down to the house of the king, to the dining room of the secretary, and, look! there is where all the princes were sitting, E&middot;lish&acute;a&middot;ma the secretary and De&middot;la&acute;iah the son of She&middot;mai&acute;ah and El&middot;na&acute;than the son of Ach&acute;bor and Gem&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Sha&acute;phan and Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah and all the other princes.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And Mi&middot;cai&acute;ah proceeded to tell them all the words that he had heard when Bar&acute;uch read aloud from the book in the ears of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">Then all the princes sent out to Bar&acute;uch Je&middot;hu&acute;di the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Shel&middot;e&middot;mi&acute;ah the son of Cush&acute;i, saying: “The roll from which you read aloud in the ears of the people—take it in your hand and come.” Accordingly Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah took the roll in his hand and came in to them.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Then they said to him: “Sit down, please, and read it aloud in our ears.” So Bar&acute;uch read aloud in their ears.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Now it came about that as soon as they heard all the words, they looked at one another in dread; and they proceeded to say to Bar&acute;uch: “We shall without fail tell the king all these words.”</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And Bar&acute;uch they asked, saying: “Tell us, please, How did you write all these words from his mouth?”</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Bar&acute;uch said to them: “Out of his mouth he kept declaring to me all these words, and I was writing in the book with ink.”</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Finally the princes said to Bar&acute;uch: “Go, conceal yourself, you and Jeremiah, so that no one at all will know where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men are.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Then they came in to the king, to the courtyard, and the roll they entrusted to the dining room of E&middot;lish&acute;a&middot;ma the secretary; and they began to tell all the words in the ears of the king.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">So the king sent Je&middot;hu&acute;di out to get the roll. Accordingly he got it out of the dining room of E&middot;lish&acute;a&middot;ma the secretary. And Je&middot;hu&acute;di began to read it aloud in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes standing by the king.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the king was sitting in the winter house, in the ninth month, with a brazier burning before him.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Then it came about that as soon as Je&middot;hu&acute;di had read three or four page-columns, he proceeded to tear it apart with the secretary’s knife, pitching [it] also into the fire that was in the brazier until all the roll ended up in the fire that was in the brazier.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And they felt no dread; neither did the king and all his servants, who were listening to all these words, rip their garments apart.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And even El&middot;na&acute;than and De&middot;la&acute;iah and Gem&middot;a&middot;ri&acute;ah themselves pleaded with the king not to burn the roll, but he did not listen to them.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Further, the king commanded Je&middot;rah&acute;me&middot;el the son of the king and Se&middot;rai&acute;ah the son of Az&acute;ri&middot;el and Shel&middot;e&middot;mi&acute;ah the son of Ab&acute;de&middot;el to get Bar&acute;uch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet. But Jehovah kept them concealed.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And the word of Jehovah occurred further to Jeremiah after the king had burned up the roll with the words that Bar&acute;uch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“Take again for yourself a roll, another one, and write on it all the first words that proved to be on the first roll, which Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah burned up.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">And against Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah you should say, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “You yourself have burned up this roll, saying, ‘Why is it that you have written on it, saying: “The king of Babylon will come without fail and will certainly bring this land to ruin and cause man and beast to cease from it”?’</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said against Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah, ‘He will come to have no one sitting upon the throne of David, and his own dead body will become something thrown out to the heat by day and to the frost by night.</span> <a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">And I will call to account against him and against his offspring and against his servants their error, and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men of Judah all the calamity that I have spoken against them, and they did not listen.’”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Jeremiah himself took another roll and then gave it to Bar&acute;uch the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah, the secretary, who proceeded to write upon it at the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim the king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added to them many more words like those.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the son of Jo&middot;si&acute;ah began to reign in place of Co&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim, whom Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he himself and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Jehovah that he spoke by means of Jeremiah the prophet.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to send Je&middot;hu&acute;cal the son of Shel&middot;e&middot;mi&acute;ah and Zeph&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of Ma&middot;a&middot;sei&acute;ah the priest to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “Pray, please, in our behalf to Jehovah our God.”</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And Jeremiah was coming in and going out into the midst of the people, as they had not put him in the house of detention.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And there was a military force of Phar&acute;aoh that came out of Egypt; and the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans that were laying siege to Jerusalem got to hear the report about them. So they withdrew from against Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘This is what <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men should say to the king of Judah, the one sending <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to me to inquire of me: “Look! The military force of Phar&acute;aoh that is coming forth to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people for the purpose of assistance will have to go back to their land, Egypt.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans will certainly come back and fight against this city and capture it and burn it with fire.”</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">This is what Jehovah has said: “Do not deceive <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls, saying, ‘The Chal&middot;de&acute;ans will without fail go away from against us,’ because they will not go away.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">For if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men had struck down all the military force of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who are fighting <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and there remained over among them men pierced through, they would each one in his tent rise up and actually burn this city with fire.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And it occurred when the military force of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans had withdrawn themselves from against Jerusalem because of the military force of Phar&acute;aoh,</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">that Jeremiah began to go forth from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin and to get [his] portion from there in the midst of the people.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">So it came about when he was in the Gate of Benjamin that the officer holding the oversight, whose name was I&middot;ri&acute;jah the son of Shel&middot;e&middot;mi&acute;ah the son of Han&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, was there. At once he took hold of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “It is to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans that you are falling away!”</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">But Jeremiah said: “It is false! I am not falling away to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.” But he did not listen to him. So I&middot;ri&acute;jah kept hold of Jeremiah and brought him in to the princes.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And the princes began to get indignant at Jeremiah, and they struck him and put him into the house of fetters, in the house of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;than the secretary, for this was what they had made the house of detention.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">When Jeremiah came into the house of the cistern and into the vaulted rooms, then Jeremiah continued dwelling there many days.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to send and take him, and the king began asking him questions in his house in a place of concealment. And he went on to say: “Does there exist a word from Jehovah?” To this Jeremiah said: “There does exist!” And he said further: “Into the hand of the king of Babylon you will be given!”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Then Jeremiah said to King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah: “In what way have I sinned against you and against your servants and against this people, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men have put me into the house of detention?</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Where, now, are <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> prophets who prophesied to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men and against this land’?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And now listen, please, O my lord the king. May my request for favor, please, fall before you, and do not send me back to the house of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;than the secretary, that I may not die there.”</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">Accordingly King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah commanded, and they then put Jeremiah in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard; and there was a giving of a round loaf of bread to him daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread was exhausted from the city. And Jeremiah continued dwelling in the Courtyard of the Guard.</span>

       <span id="vs1">And Sheph&middot;a&middot;ti&acute;ah the son of Mat&acute;tan and Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of Pash&acute;hur and Ju&acute;cal the son of Shel&middot;e&middot;mi&acute;ah and Pash&acute;hur the son of Mal&middot;chi&acute;jah got to hear the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘The one continuing to dwell in this city is the one that will die by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence. But the one going out to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans is the one that will keep living and that will certainly come to have his soul as a spoil and alive.’</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Without fail this city will be given into the hand of the military force of the king of Babylon, and he will certainly capture it.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And the princes began to say to the king: “Let this man, please, be put to death, for that is how he is weakening the hands of the men of war who are left remaining in this city and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them according to these words. For this man is one seeking not for the peace of this people but for calamity.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said: “Look! He is in <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands. For there is nothing at all in which the king himself can prevail against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And they proceeded to take Jeremiah and throw him into the cistern of Mal&middot;chi&acute;jah the son of the king, which was in the Courtyard of the Guard. So they let Jeremiah down by means of ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah began to sink down into the mire.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;an, a man who was a eunuch and who was in the house of the king, got to hear that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern; and the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech went out of the house of the king and spoke to the king, saying:</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">“O my lord the king, these men have done bad in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the cistern, so that he will die where he is because of the famine. For there is no bread anymore in the city.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then the king commanded E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;an, saying: “Take in your charge from this place thirty men, and you must get Jeremiah the prophet up out of the cistern before he dies.”</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Accordingly E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech took the men in his charge and went into the house of the king to beneath the treasury and took from there worn-out rags and worn-out pieces of cloth and let them down to Jeremiah into the cistern by means of the ropes.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Then E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;an said to Jeremiah: “Put, please, the worn-out rags and the pieces of cloth under your armpits beneath the ropes.” Jeremiah now did so.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Finally they drew out Jeremiah by means of the ropes and brought him up out of the cistern. And Jeremiah continued to dwell in the Courtyard of the Guard.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to send and take Jeremiah the prophet to him to the third entryway, which is in the house of Jehovah, and then the king said to Jeremiah: “I am asking something of you. Do not hide from me anything.”</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">At this Jeremiah said to Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah: “In case I should tell you, will you not without fail put me to death? And in case I advise you, you will not listen to me.”</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">At that King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah swore to Jeremiah in the place of concealment, saying: “As Jehovah is alive, who has made for us this soul, I will not put you to death, and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking for your soul.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">Jeremiah now said to Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah: “This is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘If you will without fail go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, your soul will also certainly keep living and this city itself will not be burned with fire, and you yourself and your household will certainly keep living.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">But if you will not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city must also be given into the hand of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, and they will actually burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape out of their hand.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Then King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah said to Jeremiah: “I am in fright of the Jews that have fallen away to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, for fear that they might give me into their hand and they might actually deal abusively with me.”</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">But Jeremiah said: “They will do no such giving. Obey, please, the voice of Jehovah in what I am speaking to you, and it will go well with you, and your soul will continue to live.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">But if you are refusing to go out, this is the thing that Jehovah has caused me to see:</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And, look! all the women that have been left remaining in the house of the king of Judah are being brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon, and they are saying,</span>
</p>

<p class="p"> 
       <span id="vs22-2">‘The men at peace with you have allured you and prevailed over you.<br><span class="p">They have caused your foot to sink down into the very ooze; they have retreated in the opposite direction.’</span></span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And all your wives and your sons they are bringing out to the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, and you yourself will not escape out of their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and because of you this city will be burned with fire.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to say to Jeremiah: “May no man at all get to know about these things, so that you do not die.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">And in case the princes hear that I have spoken with you and they actually come in to you and say to you, ‘Do tell us, please, What did you speak about to the king? Do not hide anything from us, and we shall not put you to death. And what did the king speak about to you?’</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">you must also say to them, ‘I was letting my request for favor fall before the king, that he should not send me back to the house of Je&middot;hon&acute;a&middot;than to die there.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">In time all the princes came in to Jeremiah and began questioning him. In turn, he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they became silent before him, for the matter was not heard.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And Jeremiah continued to dwell in the Courtyard of the Guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And it occurred just when Jerusalem was captured.</span>

       <span id="vs4">Now it came about that as soon as Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they began to run away and to go out by night from the city by the way of the garden of the king, by the gate between the double wall; and they kept going out by the way of the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And a military force of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans went chasing after them, and they got to overtake Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah in the desert plains of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho. Then they took him and brought him up to Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon at Rib&acute;lah in the land of Ha&acute;math that he might pronounce upon him judicial decisions.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">And the king of Babylon proceeded to slaughter the sons of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah in Rib&acute;lah before his eyes, and all the nobles of Judah the king of Babylon slaughtered.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">And the eyes of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah he blinded, after which he bound him with copper fetters, in order to bring him to Babylon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And the house of the king and the houses of the people the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans burned with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem they pulled down.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">And the rest of the people who were left remaining in the city, and the deserters that had fallen away to him, and the rest of the people who were left remaining Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard took into exile to Babylon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And some of the people, the lowly ones who had nothing at all, Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard let remain in the land of Judah; and he went on to give them vineyards and compulsory services on that day.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Furthermore, Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah by means of Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard, saying:</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">“Take him and keep your own eyes set upon him, and do not do to him anything bad at all. But just as he may speak to you, so do with him.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Accordingly Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard and Neb&middot;u&middot;shaz&acute;ban the Rab&acute;sa&middot;ris, and Ner&acute;gal-shar&middot;e&acute;zer the Rab&acute;mag and all the principal men of the king of Babylon sent;</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">they even proceeded to send and take Jeremiah out of the Courtyard of the Guard and give him over to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan, in order to bring him forth to [his] house, that he might dwell in the midst of the people.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And to Jeremiah the word of Jehovah occurred while he happened to be shut up in the Courtyard of the Guard, saying:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“Go, and you must say to E&acute;bed-mel&acute;ech the E&middot;thi&middot;o&acute;pi&middot;an, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “Here I am bringing true my words upon this city for calamity and not for good, and they will certainly happen before you in that day.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“‘And I will deliver you in that day,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you yourself are scared.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“‘For I shall without fail furnish you an escape, and by the sword you will not fall; and you will certainly come to have your soul as a spoil, because you have trusted in me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>

       <span id="vs2">Then the chief of the bodyguard took Jeremiah and said to him: “Jehovah your God himself spoke this calamity against this place,</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">that Jehovah might bring [it] true and do just as he has spoken, because <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have sinned against Jehovah and have not obeyed his voice. And this thing has happened to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And now, look! I have let you loose today from the handcuffs that were upon your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I shall keep my eye upon you. But if it is bad in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, refrain. See! The entire land is before you. To wherever it is good and right in your eyes to go, go there.”</span>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And he was yet not one that would return, when [Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an said]: “Do return to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan, whom the king of Babylon has commissioned over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people; or to wherever it is right in your eyes to go, go.”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs5-2">And the chief of the bodyguard then gave him a food allowance and a present and let him go.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">Accordingly Jeremiah came to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam at Miz&acute;pah and took up dwelling with him in the midst of the people who were left remaining in the land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>

       <span id="vs9">And Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan proceeded to swear to them and to their men, saying: “Do not be afraid of serving the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And all the Jews that were in Mo&acute;ab and among the sons of Am&acute;mon and in E&acute;dom and those who were in all the [other] lands, they also heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah and that he had commissioned over them Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And all the Jews began to return from all the places to which they had been dispersed, and they kept coming into the land of Judah to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah at Miz&acute;pah. And they went gathering wine and summer fruits in very great quantity.</span>

       <span id="vs1">So it came about in the seventh month that Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the son of E&middot;lish&acute;a&middot;ma of the royal offspring and [of the] principal men of the king and ten other men with him came to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam at Miz&acute;pah. And there they began to eat bread together in Miz&acute;pah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">Then Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah and the ten men that happened to be with him rose up and struck down Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam the son of Sha&acute;phan with the sword. So he put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had commissioned over the land.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And all the Jews who happened to be with him, that is, with Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah, in Miz&acute;pah, and the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans who were found there, that is, the men of war, Ish&acute;ma&middot;el struck down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And it came about on the second day of the putting of Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah to death, when there was no one at all that knew [it],</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">then there came men from She&acute;chem, from Shi&acute;loh and from Sa&middot;mar&acute;i&middot;a, eighty men with their beards shaved off and with their garments ripped apart and with cuts made upon themselves, and there were grain offering and frankincense in their hand to bring to the house of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah went out from Miz&acute;pah to meet them, weeping while he was walking along. And it came about that as soon as he encountered them he proceeded to say to them: “Come to Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam.”</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">But it occurred that as soon as they came into the midst of the city, Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah went slaughtering them [and throwing them] into the midst of the cistern, he and the men that were with him.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">But there were ten men that were found among them who immediately said to Ish&acute;ma&middot;el: “Do not put us to death, for there exist in our possession hidden treasures in the field, wheat and barley and oil and honey.” So he refrained, and he did not put them to death in the midst of their brothers.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Now the cistern into which Ish&acute;ma&middot;el threw all the carcasses of the men that he had struck down was a great cistern, the one that King A&acute;sa had made because of Ba&acute;a&middot;sha the king of Israel. It was the one that Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah filled with those slain.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">Then Ish&acute;ma&middot;el took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Miz&acute;pah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were remaining over in Miz&acute;pah, whom Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard had put in the custody of Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam. So Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah took them captive and went off to cross over to the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">In time Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Ka&middot;re&acute;ah and all the chiefs of the military forces who were with him got to hear all the bad that Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah had done.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">Consequently they took all the men and went off to fight against Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah and found him by the abundant waters that were in Gib&acute;e&middot;on.</span>
</p>

       <span id="vs13">Then it came about that as soon as all the people that were with Ish&acute;ma&middot;el saw Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Ka&middot;re&acute;ah and all the chiefs of the military forces who were with him, they began to rejoice.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And all the people whom Ish&acute;ma&middot;el had led captive from Miz&acute;pah proceeded to turn around and return and go to Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Ka&middot;re&acute;ah.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And as for Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, he escaped with eight men from before Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan, that he might go to the sons of Am&acute;mon.</span>

       <span id="vs16">Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Ka&middot;re&acute;ah and all the chiefs of the military forces who were with him now took all the remnant of the people whom they brought back from Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah, from Miz&acute;pah, after he had struck down Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam, able-bodied men, men of war, and the wives and the little children and the court officials, whom he brought back from Gib&acute;e&middot;on.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">So they went and took up dwelling in the lodging place of Chim&acute;ham that was beside Beth&acute;le&middot;hem, in order to go on and enter into Egypt,</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">because of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans; for they had become afraid because of them, since Ish&acute;ma&middot;el the son of Neth&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah had struck down Ged&middot;a&middot;li&acute;ah the son of A&middot;hi&acute;kam, whom the king of Babylon had commissioned over the land.</span>

       <span id="vs2">and said to Jeremiah the prophet: “May our request for favor, please, fall before you, and do you pray in our behalf to Jehovah your God, in behalf of all this remnant, for we have been left remaining, a few out of many, just as your eyes are seeing us.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">And may Jehovah your God tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">At that Jeremiah the prophet said to them: “I have heard.

</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">And they, for their part, said to Jeremiah: “May Jehovah prove to be a true and faithful witness against us if it is not according to every word with which Jehovah your God sends you to us that we shall exactly do.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Now it came about at the end of ten days that the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">So he called for Jo&middot;ha&acute;nan the son of Ka&middot;re&acute;ah and for all the chiefs of the military forces who were with him and for all the people, from the smallest one even to the greatest one;</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">and he went on to say to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sent me to cause your request for favor to fall before him, has said,</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">‘If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will without fail keep dwelling in this land, I will also build <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> up and I shall not tear [<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>] down, and I will plant <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and I shall not uproot [<span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>]; for I shall certainly feel regret over the calamity that I have caused to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Do not be afraid because of the king of Babylon, of whom <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in fear.’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs11-2">“‘Do not be afraid because of him,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘for I am with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, in order to save <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and to deliver <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> out of his hand.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I shall give to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> mercies, and he will certainly have mercy upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and return <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own soil.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“‘But if <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are saying: “No; we are not going to dwell in this land!” in order to disobey the voice of Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God,</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">saying: “No, but into the land of Egypt we shall enter, where we shall see no war and the sound of the horn we shall not hear and for bread we shall not go hungry; and there is where we shall dwell”;</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">even now therefore hear the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “If <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves positively set <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> faces to enter into Egypt and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> actually enter in to reside there as aliens,</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">it must also occur that the very sword of which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are afraid will there catch up with <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in the land of Egypt, and the very famine at which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are in a fright will there closely follow after <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> to Egypt; and there is where <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will die.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And it will come about that all the men that have set their faces to enter into Egypt to reside there as aliens will be the ones to die by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence; and they will not come to have a survivor or an escapee, because of the calamity that I am bringing in upon them.”’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">“For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Just as my anger and my rage have been poured out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my rage will be poured out upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> because of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> entering into Egypt, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will certainly become a curse and an object of astonishment and a malediction and a reproach, and you will no more see this place.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Jehovah has spoken against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>, O remnant of Judah. Do not enter into Egypt.

       <span id="vs20">that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> have committed error against <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls; for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> yourselves have sent me to Jehovah <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> God, saying, ‘Pray in our behalf to Jehovah our God; and according to everything that Jehovah our God says tell us that way, and we shall certainly do.’</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>

       <span id="vs22">And now <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> should positively know that by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will die in the place into which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do delight to enter to reside as aliens.”</span>

       <span id="vs1">The word that occurred to Jeremiah for all the Jews that were dwelling in the land of Egypt, the ones dwelling in Mig&acute;dol and in Tah&acute;pan&middot;hes and in Noph and in the land of Path&acute;ros, saying:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought in upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah, and here they are a devastated place this day, and in them there is no inhabitant.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">It is because of their badness that they did in order to offend me by going and making sacrificial smoke and rendering service to other gods whom they themselves had not known, neither <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> nor <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">And I kept sending to <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending, saying: “Do not do, please, this detestable sort of thing that I have hated.”</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">But they did not listen, nor did they incline their ear to turn back from their badness by not making sacrificial smoke to other gods.</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">So my rage, and my anger, was poured out and it burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they came to be a devastated place, a desolate waste, as at this day.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">“And now this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Why are <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> causing a great calamity to <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> souls, in order to cut off from yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, so that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> do not leave over for yourselves a remnant;</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">by offending me with the works of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands by making sacrificial smoke to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> are entering to reside as aliens; for the purpose of causing a cutting off of yourselves and for the purpose of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> becoming a malediction and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Have <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> forgotten the bad deeds of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers and the bad deeds of the kings of Judah and the bad deeds of their wives and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> own bad deeds and the bad deeds of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, that they have done in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And down to this day they did not feel crushed, and they did not become afraid, nor did they walk in my law and in my statutes that I put before <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and before <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am setting my face against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for calamity and for cutting off all Judah.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And I will take the remnant of Judah who set their faces to enter into the land of Egypt to reside there as aliens, and they will all certainly come to their finish in the land of Egypt. They will fall by the sword; [and] by the famine they will come to their finish, from the smallest one even to the greatest one; by the sword and by the famine they will die. And they must become a curse, an object of astonishment and a malediction and a reproach.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And I will hold an accounting against those dwelling in the land of Egypt, just as I held an accounting against Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine and with the pestilence.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And there will come to be no escapee or survivor for the remnant of Judah who are entering in to reside there as aliens, in the land of Egypt, even to return to the land of Judah to which they are lifting up their soul[ful desire] to return in order to dwell; for they will not return, except some escaped ones.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And all the men who were knowing that their wives had been making sacrificial smoke to other gods, and all the wives who were standing as a great congregation, and all the people who were dwelling in the land of Egypt, in Path&acute;ros, proceeded to answer Jeremiah, saying:</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">“As regards the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we are not listening to you;</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">but we shall positively do every word that has gone forth from our mouth, in order to make sacrificial smoke to the ‘queen of the heavens’ and to pour out to her drink offerings, just as we ourselves and our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, when we used to be satisfied with bread and to be well off, and we did not see any calamity at all.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And from the time that we ceased to make sacrificial smoke to the ‘queen of the heavens’ and pour out drink offerings to her we have lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have come to our finish.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Also, when we were making sacrificial smoke to the ‘queen of the heavens’ and [were disposed] to pour out drink offerings to her, did we without asking our husbands make for her sacrificial cakes, in order to make an image of her, and to pour out drink offerings to her?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">In turn Jeremiah said to all the people, to the able-bodied men and to the wives and to all the people, who were answering him with a word, saying:</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“As for the sacrificial smoke that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> made in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> forefathers, <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> kings and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> princes and the people of the land, was it not this that Jehovah remembered and that proceeded to come up into his heart?</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Finally Jehovah was no longer able to put up with it because of the badness of <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> dealings, because of the detestable things that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> had done, and so <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> land came to be a devastated place and an object of astonishment and a malediction, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">Because of the fact that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> made sacrificial smoke and that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> sinned against Jehovah and did not obey the voice of Jehovah and in his law and in his statutes and in his reminders <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> did not walk, that is why there has befallen <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> this calamity as at this day.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">And Jeremiah continued on to say to all the people and to all the women: “Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘As for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men and <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> wives, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> women also speak with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> mouths, (and with <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> hands <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people have made a fulfillment,) saying: “We shall without fail perform our vows that we have vowed, to make sacrificial smoke to the ‘queen of the heavens’ and to pour out drink offerings to her.” Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> women will without fail carry out <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> vows, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will without fail perform <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> vows.’</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, ‘“Here I myself have sworn by my great name,” Jehovah has said, “that my name will no more prove to be something called out by the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, ‘As the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is alive!’ in all the land of Egypt.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Here I am keeping alert toward them for calamity and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt will certainly come to their finish by the sword and by the famine, until they cease to be.</span> <a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">And as for the ones escaping from the sword, they will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all those of the remnant of Judah, who are coming into the land of Egypt to reside there as aliens, will certainly know whose word comes true, that from me or that from them.”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“‘And this is the sign for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span>,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘that I am turning my attention upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> in this place, in order that <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> may know that my words will without fail come true upon <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> for calamity:</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am giving Phar&acute;aoh Hoph&acute;ra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those seeking for his soul, just as I have given Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah into the hand of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one seeking for his soul.”’”</span>

       <span id="vs31">That is why it is over Mo&acute;ab that I shall howl, and for Mo&acute;ab in his entirety I shall cry out. For the men of Kir-he&acute;res one shall moan.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">“‘With more than the weeping for Ja&acute;zer I shall weep for you, O vine of Sib&acute;mah. Your own flourishing shoots have crossed over the sea. To the sea—[to] Ja&acute;zer—they have reached. Upon your summer fruitage and upon your grape gathering the despoiler himself has fallen.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And rejoicing and joyfulness have been taken away from the orchard and from the land of Mo&acute;ab. And from the winepresses I have caused the wine itself to cease. No one will be doing the treading with shouting. The shouting will be no shouting.’”</span>

       <span id="vs35">And I will cause to cease from Mo&acute;ab,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘the one bringing up an offering upon the high place and the one making sacrificial smoke to his god.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">That is why my own heart will be boisterous for Mo&acute;ab himself, just like flutes; and for the men of Kir-he&acute;res my very heart will be boisterous, just like flutes. That is why the very abundance that he has produced will certainly perish.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">For upon every head there is baldness, and every beard is clipped. Upon all hands there are cuts, and upon the hips there is sackcloth!’”</span>

       <span id="vs38">“‘On all the roofs of Mo&acute;ab and in her public squares—all of it—there is wailing; for I have broken Mo&acute;ab just like a vessel in which there is no delight,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">‘O how she has become terrified! Howl, <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people! O how Mo&acute;ab has turned the back! He has become ashamed. And Mo&acute;ab has become an object of ridicule and something terrifying to all those round about him.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Look! Just like an eagle that pounces, someone must also spread his wings over Mo&acute;ab.</span> <a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">The towns will actually be captured, and her own strong places will certainly be seized. And the heart of the mighty men of Mo&acute;ab must become in that day like the heart of a wife having childbirth distress.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“‘And Mo&acute;ab will certainly be annihilated from being a people, for it is against Jehovah that he has put on great airs.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Dread and the hollow and the trap are upon you, O inhabitant of Mo&acute;ab,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">‘Anyone fleeing because of the dread will fall into the hollow; and anyone coming up out of the hollow will be caught in the trap.’</span>

<p><a name="bk1" class="vsAnchor">1</a>
       <span id="vs1">For the sons of Am&acute;mon this is what Jehovah has said: “Are there no sons that Israel has, or is there no inheritor that he has? Why is it that Mal&acute;cam has taken possession of Gad, and his own people have taken up dwelling in [Israel’s] very cities?”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“‘Therefore, look! there are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I will cause the alarm signal of war to be heard even against Rab&acute;bah of the sons of Am&acute;mon; and she will certainly become a mound of a desolate waste, and her dependent towns themselves will be set aflame in the very fire.’</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs2-2">“‘And Israel will actually take possession of those in possession of him,’ Jehovah has said.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">“‘Howl, O Hesh&acute;bon, for A&acute;i has been despoiled! Cry out, O dependent towns of Rab&acute;bah. Gird sackcloth on yourselves. Wail, and rove about among the stone pens, for Mal&acute;cam himself will go even into exile, his priests and his princes, all together.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Why do you brag about the low plains, your flowing low plain, O daughter unfaithful, you the one trusting in her treasures, [saying:] “Who will come to me?”’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">“‘Here I am bringing in upon you a dreadful thing,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, ‘from all those round about you. And <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> people will certainly be dispersed, each one in his own direction, and there will be no one collecting together those running away.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">“‘But afterward I shall gather the captive ones of the sons of Am&acute;mon,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">For E&acute;dom this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Is there no longer any wisdom in Te&acute;man? Has counsel perished from those having understanding? Has their wisdom gone to putrefying?</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Flee! Let yourselves give way! Go down deep in order to dwell, O inhabitants of De&acute;dan! For the disaster of E&acute;sau I will bring in upon him, the time that I must turn my attention to him.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">If grape gatherers themselves actually came in to you, would they not let some gleanings remain? If thieves [came in] by night, they would certainly cause only as much ruin as they wanted.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">But as for me, I will strip E&acute;sau bare. I will uncover his places of concealment, and one will not be able to hide oneself. His offspring and his brothers and his neighbors will certainly be despoiled, and he will not be.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">Do leave your fatherless boys. I myself shall preserve [them] alive, and your own widows will trust even in me.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">For this is what Jehovah has said: “Look! Although it is not their custom to drink the cup, they will drink without fail. And you yourself, will you be absolutely left unpunished? You will not be left unpunished, for you will drink without fail.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">“For by my own self I have sworn,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “that nothing but an object of astonishment, a reproach, a devastation and a malediction will Boz&acute;rah become; and all her own cities will become devastated places to time indefinite.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">There is a report that I have heard from Jehovah, and there is an envoy that is sent among the nations, [saying:] “Collect yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to battle.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">“For, look! I have made you small indeed among the nations, despised among mankind.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">The shuddering you caused has deceived you, the presumptuousness of your heart, O you who are residing in the retreats of the crag, holding the height of the hill. Although you build your nest high up just like an eagle, down from there I shall bring you,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“And E&acute;dom must become an object of astonishment. Everyone passing along by her will stare in astonishment and whistle on account of all her plagues.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Just as in the overthrow of Sod&acute;om and Go&middot;mor&acute;rah and her neighbor [towns],” Jehovah has said, “no man will dwell there, and no son of mankind will reside in her as an alien.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">“Look! Someone will come up just like a lion from the proud [thickets] along the Jordan to the durable abiding place, but in a moment I will make him run away from her. And the one who is chosen I shall appoint over her. For who is like me, and who will challenge me, and who, now, is the shepherd that can stand before me?</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Therefore hear, O men, the counsel of Jehovah that he has formulated against E&acute;dom, and his thoughts that he has thought out against the inhabitants of Te&acute;man: Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged about. Surely on account of them he will make their dwelling place become desolate.</span> <a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">At the sound of their falling the earth has begun to rock. There is an outcry! The sound of it has been heard even at the Red Sea.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">Look! Just like an eagle someone will ascend and pounce down, and he will spread out his wings over Boz&acute;rah; and the heart of the mighty men of E&acute;dom will actually become in that day like the heart of the wife having distress in childbirth.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">For Damascus: “Ha&acute;math and Ar&acute;pad have become ashamed, for it is a bad report that they have heard. They have disintegrated. In the sea there is anxious care; it is not able to keep undisturbed.</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Damascus has lost courage. She has turned to flee, and sheer panic has seized her. Distress and birth pangs themselves have taken hold of her, as with a woman that is giving birth.</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">How is it that the city of praise has not been abandoned, the town of exultation?</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">“Therefore her young men will fall in her public squares, and all the men of war themselves will be brought to silence in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">“And I will set a fire ablaze on the wall of Damascus, and it will certainly devour the dwelling towers of Ben-ha&acute;dad.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">For Ke&acute;dar and the kingdoms of Ha&acute;zor, which Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon struck down, this is what Jehovah has said: “Rise up, go up to Ke&acute;dar, O men, and despoil the sons of the East.</span> <a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Their own tents and their own flocks will be taken, their tent cloths and all their articles. And their own camels will be carried off from them. And they will certainly cry out to them, ‘Fright is all around!’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">“Flee, take flight far away; go down deep in order to dwell, O inhabitants of Ha&acute;zor,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “For Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon has formulated a counsel even against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> and has thought out against <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> a thought.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Rise up, O men, go up against the nation that is at ease, dwelling in security!” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs31-2">“No doors and no bar does it have. Solitary they reside.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And their camels must become a plunder, and the multitude of their livestock a spoil. And I will scatter them to every wind, those who have their hair clipped at the temples; and from all regions near it I shall bring in their disaster,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">“And Ha&acute;zor must become the lair of jackals, a desolate waste to time indefinite. No man will dwell there, and in her no son of mankind will reside as an alien.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">This is what occurred as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning E&acute;lam in the beginning of the kingship of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah, saying:</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Here I am breaking the bow of E&acute;lam, the beginning of their mightiness.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">And I will bring in upon E&acute;lam the four winds from the four extremities of the heavens. And I will scatter them to all these winds, and there will prove to be no nation to which the dispersed ones of E&acute;lam will not come.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">“And I will shatter the E&acute;lam&middot;ites before their enemies and before those seeking for their soul; and I will bring upon them a calamity, my burning anger,” is the utterance of Jehovah. “And I will send after them the sword until I shall have exterminated them.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">“And I will set my throne in E&acute;lam, and I will destroy out of there the king and the princes,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">“And it will certainly occur in the final part of the days that I shall gather the captive ones of E&acute;lam,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">The word that Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, by means of Jeremiah the prophet:</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">“Tell [it] among the nations and publish [it]. And lift up a signal; publish [it]. Hide nothing, O men. Say, ‘Babylon has been captured. Bel has been put to shame. Mer&acute;o&middot;dach has become terrified. Her images have been put to shame. Her dungy idols have become terrified.’</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For against her a nation has come up from the north. It is the one that makes her land an object of astonishment, so that there proves to be no one dwelling in her. Both man and domestic animal have taken flight. They have gone away.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">“In those days and at that time,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “the sons of Israel, they and the sons of Judah together, will come. They will walk, weeping as they walk, and for Jehovah their God they will seek.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">To Zion they will keep asking the way, with their faces in that direction, [saying,] ‘Come and let us join ourselves to Jehovah in an indefinitely lasting covenant that will not be forgotten.’</span> <a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">A flock of perishing creatures my people has become. Their own shepherds have caused them to wander about. On the mountains they have led them away. From mountain to hill they have gone. They have forgotten their resting-place.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">All those finding them have eaten them up, and their own adversaries have said, ‘We shall not become guilty, due to the fact that they have sinned against Jehovah the abiding place of righteousness and the hope of their forefathers, Jehovah.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">“Take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> flight out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth even out of the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans, and become like the leading animals before the flock.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">For here I am arousing and bringing up against Babylon a congregation of great nations from the land of the north, and they will certainly array themselves against her. From there she will be captured. One’s arrows are like those of a mighty man causing bereavement of children, who does not come back without results.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And Chal&middot;de&acute;a must become a spoil. All those making spoil of her will satisfy themselves,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">“For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men kept rejoicing, for <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men kept exulting when pillaging my own inheritance. For <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept pawing like a heifer in the tender grass, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> kept neighing like stallions.</span> <a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">The mother of <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> men has become very much ashamed. She that gave <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> birth has been disappointed. Look! She is the least important of the nations, a waterless wilderness and a desert plain.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">Because of the indignation of Jehovah she will not be inhabited, and she must become a desolate waste in her entirety. As for anyone passing along by Babylon, he will stare in astonishment and whistle on account of all her plagues.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">“Array yourselves against Babylon on every side, all <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> who are treading the bow. Shoot at her. Spare no arrow, for it is against Jehovah that she has sinned.</span> <a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">Shout a war cry against her on every side. She has given her hand. Her pillars have fallen. Her walls have been torn down. For it is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> vengeance on her. Just as she has done, do to her.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one handling the sickle in the time of harvest. Because of the maltreating sword they will turn each one to his own people, and they will flee each one to his own land.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">“Israel is a scattered sheep. Lions themselves have done the dispersing. In the first instance the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a has devoured him, and in this latter instance Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon has gnawed on his bones.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am turning my attention upon the king of Babylon and upon his land in the same way that I turned my attention upon the king of As&middot;syr&acute;i&middot;a.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And I will bring Israel back to his pasture ground, and he will certainly graze on Car&acute;mel and on Ba&acute;shan; and in the mountainous region of E&acute;phra&middot;im and of Gil&acute;e&middot;ad his soul will be satisfied.’”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">“And in those days and at that time,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “the error of Israel will be searched for, but it will not be; and the sins of Judah, and they will not be found, for I shall forgive those whom I let remain.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">“Against the land of Mer&middot;a&middot;tha&acute;im—come up against her and against the inhabitants of Pe&acute;kod. Let there be a massacre and a devoting to destruction close upon them,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">There is the sound of war in the land, and a great breakdown.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">O how the forge hammer of all the earth has been cut down and gets broken! O how Babylon has become a mere object of astonishment among the nations!</span> <a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">I have laid a snare for you and you have also been caught, O Babylon, and you yourself did not know [it]. You were found and also taken hold of, for it was against Jehovah that you excited yourself.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">“Jehovah has opened his storehouse, and he brings forth the weapons of his denunciation. For there is a work that the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has in the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Come in to her from the farthest part. Open up her granaries. Bank her up, just like those making heaps, and devote her to destruction. May she not come to have any remaining ones.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Massacre all her young bulls. May they go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time for their being given attention!</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">“There is the sound of those fleeing and those escaping from the land of Babylon to tell out in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance for his temple.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">“S<span class="smallcaps">UMMON</span> against Babylon archers, all who are treading the bow. Encamp against her all around. May there prove to be no escapees. Pay back to her according to her activity. According to all that she has done, do to her. For it is against Jehovah that she has acted presumptuously, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Therefore her young men will fall in her public squares, and even all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">“Look! I am against you, O Presumptuousness,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, “for your day must come, the time that I must give you attention.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And Presumptuousness will certainly stumble and fall, and it will have no one to cause it to rise up. And I will set a fire ablaze in its cities, and it must devour all its surroundings.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “The sons of Israel and the sons of Judah are being oppressed together, and all those taking them captive have laid hold on them. They have refused to let them go.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">Their Repurchaser is strong, Jehovah of armies being his name. Without fail he will conduct their legal case, in order that he may actually give repose to the land and cause agitation to the inhabitants of Babylon.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">“There is a sword against the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and against the inhabitants of Babylon and against her princes and against her wise ones.</span> <a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">There is a sword against the empty talkers, and they will certainly act foolishly. There is a sword against her mighty men, and they will actually become terrified.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">There is a sword against their horses and against their war chariots and against all the mixed company that are in the midst of her, and they will certainly become women. There is a sword against her treasures, and they will actually be plundered.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">There is a devastation upon her waters, and they must be dried up. For it is a land of graven images, and because of [their] frightful visions they keep acting crazy.</span> <a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">Therefore the haunters of waterless regions will dwell with the howling animals, and in her the ostriches must dwell; and she will nevermore be dwelt in, nor will she reside for generation after generation.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“Just as with God’s overthrow of Sod&acute;om and of Go&middot;mor&acute;rah and of her neighbor [towns],” is the utterance of Jehovah, “no man will dwell there, nor will the son of mankind reside in her as an alien.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“Look! A people is coming in from the north; and a great nation and grand kings themselves will be roused up from the remotest parts of the earth.</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">Bow and javelin they handle. They are cruel and will show no mercy. The sound of them is like the sea that is boisterous, and upon horses they will ride; set in array as one man for war against you, O daughter of Babylon.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">“The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, and his hands have dropped down. There is distress! Severe pains have seized hold of him, just like a woman giving birth.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">“Look! Someone will come up just like a lion from the proud [thickets] along the Jordan to the durable abiding place, but in a moment I shall make them run away from her. And the one who is chosen I shall appoint over her. For who is like me, and who will challenge me, and who, now, is the shepherd that can stand before me?</span> <a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">Therefore hear, O men, the counsel of Jehovah that he has formulated against Babylon and his thoughts that he has thought out against the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans. Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged about. Surely on account of them he will cause their abiding place to be desolated.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">At the sound [when] Babylon has been seized, the earth will certainly be set rocking, and among the nations an outcry itself be heard.”</span>

       <span id="vs31">“One runner runs to meet another runner, and one reporter to meet another reporter, to report to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured at every end,</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">and that the fords themselves have been seized, and the papyrus boats they have burned with fire, and the men of war themselves have become disturbed.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor. It is the time to tread her down solid. Yet a little while and the time of the harvest must come for her.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">“Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon has eaten me up; he has thrown me into confusion. He has set me as an empty vessel. He has swallowed me down like a big snake; he has filled his abdomen with my pleasant things. He has rinsed me away.</span> <a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">‘The violence done to me and [to] my organism be upon Babylon!’ the inhabitress of Zion will say. ‘And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chal&middot;de&acute;a!’ Jerusalem will say.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am conducting your legal case, and I shall certainly execute vengeance for you. And I will dry up her sea, and I will make her wells dry.</span> <a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">And Babylon must become piles of stones, the lair of jackals, an object of astonishment and something to whistle at, without an inhabitant.</span> <a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">All together they will roar just like maned young lions. They will certainly growl like the whelps of lions.”</span>

       <span id="vs39">“When they are heated I shall set their banquets and I will make them drunk, in order that they may exult; and they must sleep an indefinitely lasting sleep, from which they will not wake up,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">“I shall bring them down like male sheep to the slaughtering, like rams along with the he-goats.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">“O how She&acute;shach has been captured, and how the Praise of the whole earth gets to be seized! How Babylon has become a mere object of astonishment among the nations!</span> <a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">The sea has come up even over Babylon. By the multitude of its waves she has been covered.</span> <a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">Her cities have become an object of astonishment, a waterless land and a desert plain. As a land, in them no man will dwell, and through them no son of mankind will pass.</span> <a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">And I will turn my attention upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth what he has swallowed. And to him nations will stream no more. Also, the wall itself of Babylon must fall.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">“Get out of the midst of her, O my people, and provide each one his soul with escape from the burning anger of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Or otherwise <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart will be timid, and <span class="smallcaps">YOU</span> will become afraid because of the report that is to be heard in the land. And in one year the report will actually come, and after it in another year there will be the report and violence in the earth and ruler against ruler.</span> <a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Therefore, look! there are days coming, and I will turn my attention upon the graven images of Babylon; and all her own land will become ashamed, and all her own slain ones will fall in the midst of her.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">“And over Babylon the heavens and the earth and all that is in them will certainly cry out joyfully, for out of the north there will come to her the despoilers,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span> <a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">“Not only was Babylon the cause for the slain ones of Israel to fall but also at Babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">“Y<span class="smallcaps">OU</span> escapees from the sword, keep going. Do not stand still. From far away remember Jehovah, and may Jerusalem herself come up into <span class="smallcaps">YOUR</span> heart.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">“We have been put to shame, for we have heard reproach. Humiliation has covered our faces, for strangers have come against the holy places of the house of Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">“Therefore, look! there are days coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will turn my attention upon her graven images, and throughout all her land the pierced one will groan.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">“Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens and even if she should make the height of her strength unapproachable, from me the despoilers will come to her,” is the utterance of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">“Listen! There is an outcry from Babylon, and a great crash from the land of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans,</span> <a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">for Jehovah is despoiling Babylon, and he will certainly destroy out of her the great voice, and their waves will actually be boisterous like many waters. The noise of their voice will certainly be given out.</span> <a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">For there must come upon her, upon Babylon, the despoiler, and her mighty men will certainly be captured. Their bows must be shattered, for Jehovah is a God of recompenses. Without fail he will repay.</span> <a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">And I will make her princes and her wise ones, her governors and her deputy rulers and her mighty men drunk, and they must sleep an indefinitely lasting sleep, from which they will not wake up,” is the utterance of the King, whose name is Jehovah of armies.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “The wall of Babylon, although broad, will without fail be demolished; and her gates, although high, will be set aflame with fire. And the peoples will have to toil for simply nothing, and national groups simply for the fire; and they will just tire themselves out.”</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Se&middot;rai&acute;ah the son of Ne&middot;ri&acute;ah the son of Mah&middot;sei&acute;ah when he went with Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his being king; and Se&middot;rai&acute;ah was the quartermaster.</span> <a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">And Jeremiah proceeded to write in one book all the calamity that would come upon Babylon, even all these words written against Babylon.</span> <a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">Furthermore, Jeremiah said to Se&middot;rai&acute;ah: “As soon as you come to Babylon and actually see [her], you must also read aloud all these words.</span> <a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">And you must say, ‘O Jehovah, you yourself have spoken against this place, in order to cut it off so that there may come to be in it no inhabitant, either man or even domestic animal, but that she may become mere desolate wastes to time indefinite.’</span> <a name="bk63" class="vsAnchor">63</a>
       <span id="vs63">And it must occur that when you will have completed reading this book, you will tie to it a stone, and you must pitch it into the midst of the Eu&middot;phra&acute;tes.</span> <a name="bk64" class="vsAnchor">64</a>
       <span id="vs64">And you must say, ‘This is how Babylon will sink down and never rise up because of the calamity that I am bringing in upon her; and they will certainly tire themselves out.’”</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs64-2">Down to this point are the words of Jeremiah.</span>

       <span id="vs1">Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and for eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Ha&middot;mu&acute;tal the daughter of Jeremiah of Lib&acute;nah.</span> <a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">And he continued to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;kim had done.</span> <a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">For on account of the anger of Jehovah it occurred in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from before his face. And Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah proceeded to rebel against the king of Babylon.</span> <a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">Finally it came about in the ninth year of his being king, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar the king of Babylon came, he and all his military force, against Jerusalem, and they began to camp against her and to build against her a siege wall all around.</span> <a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine also got to be severe in the city and there proved to be no bread for the people of the land.</span> <a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">Finally the city was broken through; and as regards all the men of war, they began to run away and go forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden, while the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans were all around against the city; and they kept going by the way of the Ar&acute;a&middot;bah.</span> <a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">And a military force of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans went chasing after the king, and they got to overtake Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah in the desert plains of Jer&acute;i&middot;cho; and all his own military force was scattered from his side.</span> <a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Rib&acute;lah in the land of Ha&acute;math, that he might pronounce upon him judicial decisions.</span> <a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>
       <span id="vs10">And the king of Babylon proceeded to slaughter the sons of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah before his eyes, and also all the princes of Judah he slaughtered in Rib&acute;lah.</span> <a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">And the eyes of Zed&middot;e&middot;ki&acute;ah he blinded, after which the king of Babylon bound him with copper fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in the house of custody until the day of his death.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that is, [in] the nineteenth year of King Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar, the king of Babylon, Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard, who was standing before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.</span> <a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">And he proceeded to burn the house of Jehovah and the house of the king and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great house he burned with fire.</span> <a name="bk14" class="vsAnchor">14</a>
       <span id="vs14">And all the walls of Jerusalem, round about, all the military forces of the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans that were with the chief of the bodyguard pulled down.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk15" class="vsAnchor">15</a>
       <span id="vs15">And some of the lowly ones of the people and the rest of the people that were left remaining in the city and the deserters that had fallen away to the king of Babylon and the rest of the master workmen Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard took into exile.</span> <a name="bk16" class="vsAnchor">16</a>
       <span id="vs16">And some of the lowly ones of the land Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard let remain as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">And the copper pillars that belonged to the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper sea that was in the house of Jehovah the Chal&middot;de&acute;ans broke to pieces and went carrying all the copper of them to Babylon.</span> <a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And the cans and the shovels and the extinguishers and the bowls and the cups and all the copper utensils with which they used to minister they took.</span> <a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">And the basins and the fire holders and the bowls and the cans and the lampstands and the cups and the bowls that were of genuine gold, and those that were of genuine silver, the chief of the bodyguard took.</span> <a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">And the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve copper bulls that were under [the sea], the carriages, that King Sol&acute;o&middot;mon had made for the house of Jehovah. There happened to be no weight [taken] of the copper of them—all these articles.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">And as regards the pillars, eighteen cubits in height was each pillar, and a thread of twelve cubits itself would go around it; and its thickness was four fingerbreadths, it being hollow.</span> <a name="bk22" class="vsAnchor">22</a>
       <span id="vs22">And the capital upon it was of copper, and the height of the one capital was five cubits; and as regards the network and the pomegranates upon the capital, all around, the whole was of copper; and the second pillar had just the same as these, also the pomegranates.</span> <a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">And the pomegranates came to be ninety-six, on the sides, all the pomegranates being one hundred upon the network round about.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">Furthermore, the chief of the bodyguard took Se&middot;rai&acute;ah the chief priest and Zeph&middot;a&middot;ni&acute;ah the second priest and the three doorkeepers,</span> <a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">and from the city he took one court official that happened to be commissioner over the men of war, and seven men of those having access to the king, who were found in the city, and the secretary of the chief of the army, the one mustering the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.</span> <a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">So these Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard took and conducted them to the king of Babylon at Rib&acute;lah.</span> <a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">And these the king of Babylon proceeded to strike down and to put them to death in Rib&acute;lah in the land of Ha&acute;math. Thus Judah went into exile from off its soil.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">These are the people whom Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar took into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">In the eighteenth year of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar, from Jerusalem there were eight hundred and thirty-two souls.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">In the twenty-third year of Neb&middot;u&middot;chad&middot;rez&acute;zar, Neb&middot;u&acute;zar&middot;ad&acute;an the chief of the bodyguard took Jews into exile, seven hundred and forty-five souls.</span>
</p>

<p> 
       <span id="vs30-2">All the souls were four thousand and six hundred.</span>
</p>

<p><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">At length it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;chin the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that E&acute;vil-mer&acute;o&middot;dach the king of Babylon, in the year of his becoming king, raised up the head of Je&middot;hoi&acute;a&middot;chin the king of Judah and proceeded to bring him forth from the prison house.</span> <a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">And he began to speak with him good things and to put his throne higher than the thrones of the [other] kings that were with him in Babylon.</span> <a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">And he took off his prison garments, and he ate bread before him constantly all the days of his life.</span> <a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">And as for his allowance, there was a constant allowance given him from the king of Babylon, daily as due, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span>
