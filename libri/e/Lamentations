<p class="l"><a name="bk2" class="vsAnchor">2</a>
       <span id="vs2">It is I whom he has led and makes to walk in darkness and not in light.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk3" class="vsAnchor">3</a>
       <span id="vs3">Indeed, it is against me that he repeatedly turns his hand all day long.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk4" class="vsAnchor">4</a>
       <span id="vs4">He has caused my flesh and my skin to wear away. He has broken my bones.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk5" class="vsAnchor">5</a>
       <span id="vs5">He has built against me, that he may encircle [me] with poisonous plant and hardship.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk6" class="vsAnchor">6</a>
       <span id="vs6">In dark places he has made me sit like men dead for a long time.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk7" class="vsAnchor">7</a>
       <span id="vs7">He has blocked me up as with a stone wall, that I may not go forth. He has made my copper fetters heavy.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk8" class="vsAnchor">8</a>
       <span id="vs8">Also, when I call for aid and cry for help, he actually hampers my prayer.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk9" class="vsAnchor">9</a>
       <span id="vs9">He has blocked up my ways with hewn stone. My roadways he has twisted.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk10" class="vsAnchor">10</a>

</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk11" class="vsAnchor">11</a>
       <span id="vs11">My ways he has disarranged, and he makes me lie fallow. He has made me one laid desolate.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk12" class="vsAnchor">12</a>
       <span id="vs12">He has trodden his bow, and he sets me up as the target for the arrow.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk13" class="vsAnchor">13</a>
       <span id="vs13">He has brought into my kidneys the sons of his quiver.</span>

<p class="l"><a name="bk17" class="vsAnchor">17</a>
       <span id="vs17">You also do a casting off so that there is no peace for my soul. I have lost memory of what good is.</span>

<p class="l"><a name="bk18" class="vsAnchor">18</a>
       <span id="vs18">And I keep saying: “My excellency has perished, and my expectation from Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk19" class="vsAnchor">19</a>
       <span id="vs19">Remember my affliction and my homeless state, the wormwood and the poisonous plant.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk20" class="vsAnchor">20</a>
       <span id="vs20">Without fail your soul will remember and bow low over me.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk21" class="vsAnchor">21</a>
       <span id="vs21">This is what I shall bring back to my heart. That is why I shall show a waiting attitude.</span>

       <span id="vs22">It is the acts of loving-kindness of Jehovah that we have not come to our finish, because his mercies will certainly not come to an end.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk23" class="vsAnchor">23</a>
       <span id="vs23">They are new each morning. Your faithfulness is abundant.</span>

<p class="l"><a name="bk24" class="vsAnchor">24</a>
       <span id="vs24">“Jehovah is my share,” my soul has said, “that is why I shall show a waiting attitude for him.”</span>

<p class="l"><a name="bk25" class="vsAnchor">25</a>
       <span id="vs25">Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, to the soul that keeps seeking for him.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk26" class="vsAnchor">26</a>
       <span id="vs26">Good it is that one should wait, even silently, for the salvation of Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk27" class="vsAnchor">27</a>
       <span id="vs27">Good it is for an able-bodied man that he should carry the yoke during his youth.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk28" class="vsAnchor">28</a>
       <span id="vs28">Let him sit solitary and keep silent, because he has laid [something] upon him.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk29" class="vsAnchor">29</a>
       <span id="vs29">Let him put his mouth in the very dust. Perhaps there exists a hope.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk30" class="vsAnchor">30</a>
       <span id="vs30">Let him give [his] cheek to the very one striking him. Let him have his sufficiency of reproach.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk31" class="vsAnchor">31</a>
       <span id="vs31">For not to time indefinite will Jehovah keep on casting off.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk32" class="vsAnchor">32</a>
       <span id="vs32">For although he has caused grief, he will also certainly show mercy according to the abundance of his loving-kindness.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk33" class="vsAnchor">33</a>
       <span id="vs33">For not out of his own heart has he afflicted or does he grieve the sons of men.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk34" class="vsAnchor">34</a>
       <span id="vs34">For crushing beneath one’s feet all the prisoners of the earth,</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk35" class="vsAnchor">35</a>
       <span id="vs35">For turning aside the judgment of an able-bodied man before the face of the Most High,</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk36" class="vsAnchor">36</a>
       <span id="vs36">For making a man crooked in his legal case, Jehovah himself has had no countenance.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk37" class="vsAnchor">37</a>
       <span id="vs37">Who, now, has said that something should occur [when] Jehovah himself has not commanded?</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk38" class="vsAnchor">38</a>
       <span id="vs38">From the mouth of the Most High bad things and what is good do not go forth.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk39" class="vsAnchor">39</a>
       <span id="vs39">How can a living man indulge in complaints, an able-bodied man on account of his sin?</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk40" class="vsAnchor">40</a>
       <span id="vs40">Do let us search out our ways and explore them, and do let us return clear to Jehovah.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk41" class="vsAnchor">41</a>
       <span id="vs41">Let us raise our heart along with [our] palms to God in the heavens:</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk42" class="vsAnchor">42</a>
       <span id="vs42">“We ourselves have transgressed, and we have behaved rebelliously. You yourself have not forgiven.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk43" class="vsAnchor">43</a>
       <span id="vs43">You have blocked approach with anger, and you keep pursuing us. You have killed; you have shown no compassion.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk44" class="vsAnchor">44</a>
       <span id="vs44">You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud mass, that prayer may not pass through.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk45" class="vsAnchor">45</a>
       <span id="vs45">You make us mere offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.”</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk46" class="vsAnchor">46</a>
       <span id="vs46">Against us all our enemies have opened their mouth.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk47" class="vsAnchor">47</a>
       <span id="vs47">Dread and the hollow themselves have become ours, desolateness and breakdown.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk48" class="vsAnchor">48</a>
       <span id="vs48">With streams of water my eye keeps running down on account of the breakdown of the daughter of my people.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk49" class="vsAnchor">49</a>
       <span id="vs49">My very eye has been poured forth and will not keep still, so that there are no pauses,</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk50" class="vsAnchor">50</a>
       <span id="vs50">Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk51" class="vsAnchor">51</a>
       <span id="vs51">My own eye has dealt severely with my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk52" class="vsAnchor">52</a>
       <span id="vs52">My enemies have positively hunted for me just as for a bird, for no cause.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk53" class="vsAnchor">53</a>
       <span id="vs53">They have silenced my life in the pit itself, and they kept hurling stones at me.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk54" class="vsAnchor">54</a>
       <span id="vs54">Waters have flowed over my head. I have said: “I shall certainly be cut off!”</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk55" class="vsAnchor">55</a>
       <span id="vs55">I have called out your name, O Jehovah, from a pit of the lowest sort.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk56" class="vsAnchor">56</a>
       <span id="vs56">My voice you must hear. Do not hide your ear to my relief, to my cry for help.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk57" class="vsAnchor">57</a>
       <span id="vs57">You have drawn near in the day that I kept calling you. You said: “Do not be afraid.”</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk58" class="vsAnchor">58</a>
       <span id="vs58">You have taken up, O Jehovah, the contests of my soul. You have repurchased my life.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk59" class="vsAnchor">59</a>
       <span id="vs59">You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me. O do conduct the judgment for me.</span>

<p class="l"><a name="bk60" class="vsAnchor">60</a>
       <span id="vs60">You have seen all their vengeance, all their thoughts against me.</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk61" class="vsAnchor">61</a>
       <span id="vs61">You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their thoughts against me,</span>
</p>

<p class="l"><a name="bk62" class="vsAnchor">62</a>
       <span id="vs62">The lips of those rising up against me and their whispering against me all day long.</span>
